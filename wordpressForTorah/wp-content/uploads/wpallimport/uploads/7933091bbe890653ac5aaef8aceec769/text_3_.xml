<P>        One of the most frequently asked questions concerning Chanuka addresses the issue of exactly which miracle does the holiday celebrate.  On the one hand, the "'al hanisim" prayer, inserted into the 'Amida and Birchat Hamazon, focuses on the Chashmonaim's victory over the mighty Greek armies.  In the G'mara Shabbat (21b), the miracle of the Menora is higlighted.  Which is the main focal point of the holiday?</P>
<P>        The Maharal (Chiddushei Aggadot, Shabbat 21b) writes that the primary celebration is over the military victory.  However, one might have mistakenly assumed that this was not miraculous.  Oftentimes, a small, indigenous band of guerrilas can oust a larger, more heavily armed army.  The neis nigleh -- open miracle -- of the Menora shed light on the neis nistar -- hidden miracle -- of the victory over the Greeks and demonstrated that the Ribono Shel 'Olam brought about both miracles.</P>
<P>        Perhaps we can suggest a further connection between the two miracles.  Our answer will also attempt to develop a connection between Chanuka and the Parshiot Hashavua, VaYeishiv and Mikeitz, which largely deal with the life of Yosef, that we read and will read on Chanuka.  The Midrash (B'raishit Rabba 2:5) comments that the Greeks told the Bnei Yisrael to "write on the horn of an ox (shor) that they have no share in the G-d of Israel."  Rav C. Y. Goldwicht zt"l, the former Rosh HaYeshiva of Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh, elucidated  this rather cryptic passage as follows.  The Greeks symbolized the height of wisdom and culture.  Their advances in philosophy, medicine, science, art as well as their strategies of war and conquest were world reknowned.  However, their great wisdom did not lead them to a moral, G-d fearing life.  The greatest philosophers and scientists of the Greek Empire could and did lead lives filled with debauchery.  Torah, by stark contrast, teaches that all wisdom must ultimately lead to a refinement of the person's personality both in terms of his middot (character traits), his system of thought, and his actions.  "Tachlis Chochma T'shuva U'Ma'asim Tovim" -- "the goal of all wisdom is to lead to repentance and good deeds."  Wisdom that does not lead to a transformation of the individual is worthless.</P>
<P>        The Greeks attempted to force the Jewish people to adopt their attitude toward wisdom, one which divorces wisdom from moral actions.  They turned to the Biblical "shor" -- Yosef Hatzaddik -- who is referred to as "B'chor Shor" (D'varim 33:17) by Moshe Rabbeinu.  Yosef, in Egypt, became at different points in his life a financial planner (head of Potiphar's household), prison warden (when he was jailed), dream interpreter, economist, and chief statestman of the Egyptian Empire.  "Look at Yosef," said the Greeks symbolically, "<u>he</u> engaged the other wisdoms of the world besides Torah and he was successful!" This is what is meant by "write on the horn of the shor."  Of course, their true motivation was to undermine the Torah and its observance entirely -- "you have no share in the G-d of Israel."  Indeed, the Greeks initially were greatly successful by attracting thousands of Helenized Jews to their ranks.  The victory of the Chasmonaim, besides its immediate benefit of allowing the Jewish people to serve G-d without restrictions, also served to teach all future generations that even when Bnei Yisrael engage the world, and learn other wisdoms, this cannot and should not lead to an abrogation of the Torah's dictates. All wisdoms should be and must be utilized in the service of Torah.  All must lead to a greater awareness of the Creator of the universe and ultimately of all wisdoms.  If such study does not achieve these results and certainly if it serves to lead one astray from Torah observance and belief in G-d, then the study must be abandoned.  Yosef, the master of all wisdoms, never forgot his allegiance to the G-d of Israel.  He demonstrated this by reminding his father, Ya'akov Avinu, before their reunification, of the last Torah lesson they had shared together before their separation -- that of 'Egla 'Arufa (see Rashi, B'raishit 45:27).  Even after engaging the world, he remained the same Yosef, always dedicated to his Creator and His Torah.</P>
<P>        Perhaps we can suggest in the same vein, that the neis of the Menora highlighted this idea as well.  As several Rishonim point out, the seven branches of the Menora represent the seven true wisdoms (e.g. see Rabbeinu B'chaye, Avot, end of Chapter 3) that were studied by humanity.  All of the branches, i.e. all of the wisdoms, "must face the middle branch" (Shmot 25:37), which symbolizes Torah wisdom.  All of intellectual endeavors must be utilized in the service of Torah and 'Avodat Hashem in order for them to be meaningful.  Hashem thus placed his stamp of approval on the victory of the Chasmonaim, which represented the idea that wisdom must be utilized for Divine service and not merely to satisfy curiosity, by bringing about a miracle through the medium of the Menora which symbolizes these ideas.</P>
<P>        The Halakhic parameters of the study of other wisdoms as well as the unquestionable primacy that must be granted to Torah study itself are clearly beyond the scope of this article (see for further reference Encylopedia Talmudit, "Chachmot Chitzoniot"; "Sha'arei Talmud Torah", Chapter 7, by Rav Yehuda (Leo) Levi; etc.). But certainly, we glean from the dual nissim of Chanuka that all of human study and achievement must have a higher purpose.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The waving of the <I>Arba Minim</I> (the Four Species) -- the <I>Na'anu'im</I>-- serves as a focal point of the <I>t'filot</I> of <I>Chag HaSukkot</I>. Interestingly, though, one can fulfill his minimal obligation by merely picking of the <I>Arba Minim</I> (See Sukka 42a). However, the clear implication of many Rishonim is that <I>Na'anu'im</I> are a <I>l'chat'chila d'Oraisa</I> - a Biblically mandated ideal enhancement to the performance of the mitzva (see Rambam (Hilchot Lulav (7:9); also Tosfot and Ritva to 37b who rule stringently in case of doubt, presumably following the rule <I>S'feika D'Oraisa L'Chumra</I>).   Indeed, the Mishna in Masechet Sukka (29b see Rashi there) indicates that unlike the <I>Hoshana</I> (myrtle) and <I>ARava</I> (willow) whose minimum size is three <I>t'fachim</I> (handbreadths), the <I>Lulav</I> requires 4 <I>t'fachim</I>.  The extra <I>tefach</I>, as the Mishna explains, is necessary "<I>k'dei l'na'nai'a bo</I>" -- in order to wave it. Although the Ba'al Ha'Itur and Me'iri maintain that this requirement for the fourth <I>tefach</I> is only <I>Mi'd'rabbanan</I>, the overwhelming majority of Rishonim and subsequent Poskim maintain that 4 <I>t'fachim</I> is an absolute requirement which would seem to indicate its Biblical origin.  Even though the <I>Na'anu'im</I> are only <I>l'chat'chila</I>, the <I>lulav </I>must at least be fit for waving.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is signified by this Biblically mandated waving? Furthermore, it is clear from the Mishna (37b) that the Four Minim are to be waved at two places in the Hallel -- once at "<I>Hodu Lashem Ki Tov</I>" -- "Give praise to G-d for He is good" and once <I>at "Ana Hashem Hoshi'a Na</I>" -- "Please G-d, save us now!".  These expressions contain drastically different themes. "<I>Hodu</I>" is a call to praise Hashem for his everlasting kindness. "Ana" is a heartfelt prayer for salvation.  How does the waving of <I>the Arba Minim</I> enhance these diverse prayers?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What clearly emerges is that the waving of the <I>Arba Minim</I> serves as both a <I>t'fila</I> of <I>bakasha</I> (request) and a song of <I>hoda'ah</I> (praise).  But how does the <I>lulav</I> accomplish both tasks?  The Mishna in Rosh Hashana (16a) relates <I>that "Be'chag nidonin al ha'mayim</I>" -- on Sukkot the world is judged concerning the amount of rainfall for that year.  The four species all require additional watering in addition to rainfall to survive.  The Torah even refers to <I>ARavot </I>as <I>Arvei Nachal</I> -- willows that grow by a river. There is even a minority position in Tosfot (34a) that the <I>ARavot</I> must grow by a river to be valid.  Even though we do not follow this position (see Shulchan Aruch (647:1) and Mishna B'rura (3)), certainly the Torah highlights the role of water in the <I>Arba Minim</I>. Indeed, one of the textual proofs that the Biblical "<I>Pri eitz hadar</I>" (Leviticus 23:40) is a citron is that the word "<I>hadar</I>" is etymologically related to the Greek "hydro" meaning water (Sukka 35a).  Hence, the Torah refers to a fruit that needs much additional watering to survive.  The waving of the species then, is a form of <I>t'fila</I> for rain.  Besides the <I>t'fila</I> for rain on <I>Shmini Atzeret</I>, we pray every day of Sukkot for rain in the Hallel by waving the <I>Arba Minim</I> at "<I>Ana</I>".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the waving of the <I>Arba Minim</I> symbolizes more than <I>bakasha</I> alone.  The Torah refers to Sukkot as the "<I>Chag Ha'asif</I>" (Exodus 23:16) -- the festival of ingathering.  The beginning of the fall ushers in the period of gathering the produce from the field into the silos and warehouses.  The long, arduous task of carefully sowing, watering, harvesting, and drying is over. The Jewish farmer can finally partake of his bounty.  Herein lies the danger of the farmer attributing his material success to his own efforts alone.  <I>"Kochi v'otzem yadi asah li es hachayil hazeh</I>" (Deutoronomy 8:17) -- "My strength alone brought about this abundance of wealth."  By waving the <I>Arba Minim</I> -- the more prominent and beautiful of the crops -- in the Hallel at "<I>Hodu</I>", the farmer turns heavenward and declares to the <I>Mashgiach Al Hakol</I> (Provider for All): "I thank You, Hashem, for your kindness to me.  I am fully cognizant that it is you "<I>Hanosein koach la'asos chayil</I>" -- that crowns my efforts with success, and without Whom there would be no crops to celebrate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This then can be the underlying meaning of the statement by R. Yochanan (Sukka 37b) that we wave back and forth to the Creator of the four corners of the world, and we wave up and down to the Creator of Heaven and Earth.   R. Yochanan underscores the role of the <I>Na'anu'im</I> as an expression of praise and thanksgiving.  R. Yose b'Rav Chanina states (ibid.) that we wave back and forth to stop harmful winds and up and down to prevent harmful precipitation.  R. Yose emphasizes the <I>bakasha</I> nature of the waving.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These underlying themes of prayer and thanksgiving through <I>mitzvot</I> other than oral <I>t'fila</I> itself appears in other <I>mitzvot</I> as well.  Rav Joseph B. Soloveitchik ZT"L, based on earlier sources, explains the blowing of the <I>shofar</I> as a form of prayer without words -- a cry symbolically emanating from the heart of the <I>mispallel</I> (petitioner) (see <I>Y'Mei Zikaron</I>).  Similarly, the Gemara in Megilla (4a) derives the requirement of the dual reading of the Megilla -- once at night and once during the day -- from two sources.  One is the passage in Tehilim (30) <I>"Lma'an y'zamercha chavod v'lo yidom Hashem Elokai l'olam odeka</I>" -- "in order that my soul sing to you and not be silent, Hashem, my G-d, forever I will thank you."  The second is from T'hilim (22) "<I>Elokai ekra yomam v'lo ta'aneh v'layla lo dumiya li</I>" -- "My G-d, I call to you by day and you do not answer, and at night and I am not silent."  Rav Betzalel Zolti ZT"L points out that the two sources apparently indicate that <I>Mikra Megila</I> contains the same dual nature as we find regarding the waving of the <I>Lulav</I>.  First, it serves as a paean to the Ribono Shel Olam who foiled Haman's plot to decimate the Jewish people.  Indeed, the Gemara (Megilla 14a) even suggests that <I>Hallel</I> need not be recited on Purim since the <I>Megila </I>itself serves as the <I>Hallel</I>.  However, the reading of the <I>Megilla</I> also serves as a <I>t'fila</I> of <I>bakasha</I>.  By reading the narrative of how Hashem has saved us in the past, we implicitly beseech Him that he redeem us from our present exile as well.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The theme of prayer through the performance of <I>mitzvot ma'asiyot</I> -- active commandments -- highlights the recurrent them of the Seifer Hachinuch.  <I>"Acharay hape'ulot nimshachim ha'l'va'vot</I>" -- the mind follows the actions.  Praying to Hashem and praising him through words alone does not suffice.  We must make use of <I>the Kol Shofar</I>, the <I>Na'anuim</I>, and <I>Mikra Megilla</I> to enhance our communication with the <I>Shomai'a T'filos</I>.  Together with the words of our <I>t'fillot</I> these <I>mitzvot</I> help stir our emotions in a way that oral prayer alone cannot do.  Ultimately though, the goal is the "<I>Avoda She'b'laiv</I> -- <I>Zo T'fila</I>" (The service of the heart which is prayer).  The <I>Mispallel</I> with the <I>Shofar</I>, the <I>Lulav</I> and <I>Megilla</I> is urged to elicit in himself an outpouring of his heart and soul to the Source of all coupled with the recognition of his utter dependence on his Creator who his only true source of help.  May all of our various forms of <I>t'filot</I> this Sukkot and throughout the whole year be answered <I>L'Tova</I>. </P>

<P>The excitement generated by the successful completion of studying the entire Torah Shebichsav - as individuals preparing the text with targum and meforshim and as a community listening to the leining and participating in public study - has its roots in several sources.  The Ramban in his commentary to Parshas Mishpatim (24:11) relates our annual dancing and perhaps any siyum to the recorded celebration of our leaders upon receiving the Torah at Sinai.  He writes, "... and they [the nobility] ate and drank - they celebrated and made a Yom Tov for one is obligated to celebrate the <B>receiving</B> of Torah." The Ramban parallels these occasions to the feast that Shlomo Hamelech feted in Yerushalayim after being granted unsurpassed intellectual gifts (Divrei Hayamim 2, 21:12) and to Dovid Hamelech's great feast marking the preparations to establish the first Beis Hamikdosh (Divrei Hayamim 1, 29:21).</P>
<P>At first blush these events and seeming precedents for our Simchas Torah are not similar at all.  The festivities of Matan Torah and of Dovid and Shlomo HaMelech celebrated the <B>anticipation </B>of  horizons of spirituality and knowledge that had just been unlocked and laid out for them. They correctly perceived that they had been catapulted beyond the boundaries that hemmed in the most talented people of  all times, and what a passionate simcha they must have experienced.  Isn't the annual completion of  V'zos Habrocho quite different?  Are we not expressing our happiness and gratitude for the privilege of <B>accomplishing</B> the understanding of part of Hashem's instruction? </P>
<P>Perhaps the Ramban wants us to understand that every siyum, be it of a mesechta or the entire Torah Shebichsav,  is celebrating not the accomplishment but rather the anticipation of applying all of one's  knowledge to future studies and situations.  Indeed that is why at every siyum we focus on the "Hadrans", praying and promising that we will return to the mesechata at hand and that the mesechta has  become an active  and alive part of our consciousness.  Thus the simcha has its roots in kabolas Hatorah and the joy of Shlomo Hamelech upon his receiving the gates of all knowledge.</P>
<P>In similar fashion we can appreciate the explanation offered by the Avudraham for our rush to start Breishis as soon as we have completed Sefer Devarim.  He refers us to a challenge that the Satan throws in an attempt to deride Klal Yisrael.  He claims that now that we have completed the study of  the entire Torah we will be putting it away and presumably go on to other masterpieces, lehavdil.    Upon hearing the beginning of Bereishis immediately after  chazak chazak, Hashem's confidence in us and our knowledge of the absolute singularity of Torah and its place in our lives, is vindicated. Perhaps the medrash is also  pointing out that Klal YIsrael sees the successful completion of one cycle not as an end but rather as a new rung in the ladder on which to penetrate the texts ever so more deeply on the next way around.  Our simcha on this Yom Tov celebrates our well founded expectation that we will always find new insights in the Torah and the blessing that we have as Torah and life continuously illuminate each other.</P>

<P>        The mitzvah of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> as it is formulated in the Torah appears to be somewhat ambiguous in terms of its essential character, purpose, and function. One verse seems to imbue the <I>mitzvah</I> with an agricultural motif, stating that the obligation to count begins "from when the sickle is first put to the standing crop" (Devarim 16:9).  Other verses stress this mitzvah's sacrificial theme, obligating us to begin the <I>mitzvah</I> of counting "from the day [we] bring the <I>omer</I> as a wave offering" and to complete it by bringing the <I>sh'tei ha-lechem</I> as an "offering to God" on the fiftieth day (Vayikra 23:15-17).  In fact, the sacrificial theme is echoed in the midrash,(1) and manifests itself most dramatically in the view subscribed to by many rishonim that <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> in our time is only a Ravnic obligation inasmuch as we no longer offer the <I>korban ha-omer</I>.(2)  Similarly, the Semag's classification of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> under the heading of <I>eidut she-be mikdash</I> calls attention to its sacrificial theme.(3)</P>

<P>        In addition to the agricultural and sacrificial themes inherent in <I>sefirat ha-omer</I>, the Torah also presents this mitzvah as a countdown to the holiday of <I>Shavu'ot</I> (Devarim 16:9-10). This is strikingly reflected by the fact that in contrast to other holidays, the Torah never associates <I>Shavu'ot</I> with a specific calendar date(4); instead it focuses exclusively on the fact that <I>Shavu'ot</I> occurs at the culmination of <I>sefirat ha-omer.</I>  Furthermore, the Torah only mentions <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> in the context of sections devoted to the the <I>shalosh regalim</I>; again implying that despite its connection to the sacrifice of the <I>omer</I>, <I>sefirat ha-omer's</I> central theme is its linking <I>Shavu'ot</I> with <I>Pesach</I>.  The Rambam's view (Temidin 7:24) that <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> is a <I>din di-oraiyta</I> (Torah obligation) in our own era despite our inability to bring the <I>korban ha-omer</I> also suggests that <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> is fundamentally some form of countdown to <I>Shavu'ot</I>.</P>

<P>        In fact this viewpoint is adopted explicitly and forcefully by the author of the Sefer ha-Chinuch.  He asserts that the Exodus should be perceived as a mere prelude to the more important goal of receiving the Torah.  Thus by counting the days between <I>Pesach</I> (which celebrates the Exodus) and <I>Shavu'ot</I> (which celebrates the giving of the Torah) we symbolize the eager anticipation of the newly freed Jews to receive the Torah, and affirm the overwhelming importance of Torah in Jewish life.  The <I>Sefer ha-Chinuch</I> minimizes the importance of the <I>korban ha-omer</I> as a theme in mitzvah of <I>sefirah</I>, claiming that the Torah merely used the <I>korban ha-omer</I> as a convenient way of identifying the second day of <I>Pesach</I> (on which the <I>sefirah</I> must begin); the <I>korban</I> itself, however, is essentially irrelevant to the character of the mitzvah of <I>sefirah</I>.(5) </P>

<P>        While the <I>Sefer ha-Chinuch's</I> stance has definite appeal, it still seems deficient in that it does not appear to adequately capture some of the intriguing facets of the mitzvah of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I>. If the sole function of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> is to mark the time between <I>Pesach</I> and <I>Shavu'ot</I>, then its significance lies in those holidays themselves, and sefirat ha-omer should not have constituted its own <I>mitzvah</I>, nor should it require a <I>berachah</I>.  In addition, the fact that there are definite <I>halachic</I> rules and regulations which govern and define the counting process itself seems to imply that the act of counting is somehow infused with meaning and inherent value. The Ramban accentuates this point when he contrasts <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> with another act of counting--that of a <I>zavah</I> (a menstruating woman who must count seven consecutive days without bleeding before she can purify herself).(6)  A <I>zavah</I> need only keep track of her count and be aware of it, but <I>sefirat ha omer</I> demands a verbalized nightly counting, during an ideal time (at the onset of each evening), utilizing a precise formula; all of these facts seem to imply that <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> possesses its own inherent significance.  Finally, the Ramban draws a parallel between the days of <I>sefirat ha-Omer</I> and the days of <I>Chol ha-Mo'ed</I> that intervene between <I>Succot</I> and <I>Shemini Atzeret</I>.(7) If the days of <I>sefirah</I> represent a form of <I>Chol ha-Mo'ed</I> between <I>Pesach</I> and <I>Shavu'ot</I>, then clearly this interim period serves an inherently important function.</P>

<P>        To resolve some of these difficulties it may be helpful view <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> from the perspective of <I>kedushat ha-zeman</I>.  Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik zt"l developed this theme at length in an essay entitled "Sacred and Profane."  He argues that time consciousness is a prerequisite to freedom. The slave who lives for the moment and does not control his own destiny, whose time is literally not his own, is exempt from all <I>mitzvot asei she-ha-zeman geramah</I> (time-restricted obligations) because he has no sensitivity to, or appreciation of, the nuances of time. Rav Soloveitchik explains the function of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I>: </P>

<P>        <BLOCKQUOTE>When the Jews were delivered from the Egyptian oppression and Moses rose to undertake the almost impossible task of metamorphosing a tribe of slaves into a nation of priests, he was told by God that the path leading from the holiday of <I>Pesach</I> to <I>Shavu'ot</I>, from initial liberation to consummate freedom, leads through the medium of time. The commandment of <I>sefirah</I> was entrusted to the Jew; the wondrous test of counting forty nine successive days was put to him. These forty-nine days must be whole. If one day is missed, the act of numeration is invalidated. </P>
<P>A slave who is capable of appreciating each day, of grasping its meaning and worth, of weaving every thread of time into a glorious fabric, quantitatively stretching over the period of seven weeks but qualitatively forming the warp and woof of centuries of change is eligible for Torah. He has achieved freedom.(8)</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P>On this basis many of the peculiar and seemingly incongruous facets of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> can be justified.  The very act of counting acquires significance and requires a <I>berachah</I> in as much as it represents a process whose aim is to sensitize man to this indispensable religious dimension of time-consciousness. If we identify <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> with time-awareness, then our act of counting is more than a simple marking of time between <I>Pesach</I> and <I>Shavu'ot</I>, or a passive noting of time's passage (like the counting of a <I>zavah</I>); rather, <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> becomes a means of effecting an important psychological and religious transformation, which is most effectively achieved by verbal articulation and daily expression. The Ramban's allusion an analogy to the concept of <I>Chol ha-Moed</I> is particularly apt in as much as <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> constitutes an essential period of transition between the slave mentality of the immediate post-<I>Pesach</I> era and the time-conscious mindset of true freedom that is prerequisite for receiving the Torah on <I>Shavu'ot</I>.(9)</P>

<P>In associating <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> with the themes of freedom and sensitivity to time it is illuminating to examine, if only briefly, other <I>halachot</I> that distinguish <I>sefirat ha-omer</I>. </P>

<P>The Talmud (Menachot 65b), commenting on the words "<I>u-sefartem lachem</I>" ("you shall count for yourselves"), declares: <I>she-tihiyeh sefirah le-kol echad vi-echad</I>-that the <I>mitsvah</I> of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> devolves upon each individual, not on the Jewish nation as  whole.  Some <I>poskim</I> take this a step further and disqualify the use of <I>shomei'ah ke-oneh</I> as a mechanism with which to accomplish this <I>mitsvah</I>.  This view dramatizes the personal motif of <I>sefirah</I>.(10) The cultivation of sensitivity and the inculcation of a mentality can be achieved effectively only on a personal level.  Individual self-development must be the focus of any such enterprise, even when the ultimate goal is the transformation of a national destiny.</P>

<P>The <I>Ba'al ha-Ma'or</I> (end of Pesachim) asks a famous question: Why should we not consider <I>sefeikah di-yomah</I> when counting <I>sefirah</I> in the Diaspora, just as we do in requiring the observance of a second day of <I>yom tov</I>?  Some <I>acharonim</I> respond that the very concept of counting would be undermined by indecisiveness. If we view <I>sefirah</I> from the perspective of time-consciousness and human autonomy, this response takes on a new dimension of meaning.(11)</P>

<P>        Finally, it is interesting to assess the method of counting and its implications against this background. The Talmud (<I>Menachot</I> 66a) informs us: "Abaye says there is an obligation to count the days of <I>sefirah</I> and there is also an obligation to count the weeks." This statement reflects the two types of time-awareness: the long term perspective and the immediate perspective.  Clearly one of the most salient features of free and progressive man is his ability to plan ahead, to work toward a long-term objective with foresight. By living for the future and preparing for it, he asserts and demonstrates a measure of autonomy over his life. By being goal- and project-oriented, he is able to infuse his life with meaning and purpose. This theme is reflected in the concept of "counting weeks." </P>

<P>        There is, however, a definite hazard in focusing on the future to the exclusion of the present. If long-term objectives and goals totally dominate one's actions and attitudes, the urgency of the present and its unique opportunities may be lost. In compromising the integrity of the present for the sake of the future, one generally undermines the ultimate purpose as well. Thus we are instructed to treat each day as a discrete unit--to "count days." The Rambam, in his <I>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</I> (<I>asei</I> 161) goes to great length to prove that despite the existence of these two distinct motifs--of days and of weeks--they in fact comprise one integrated mitzvah.(12) </P>

<P>        The challenge we face, then, is clear.  We must endeavor to harmonize and reconcile our long-term growth (the "counting of weeks") with our immediate needs (the "counting of days"), and to cultivate a sensitivity to time in all of its various dimensions. Then we will effectively be able to partake in the transforming process of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I>, the bridge which will bring us to Sinai.</P>

<P>1.      Midrash Rabbah on Emor (Parshah 28) and Ramban on Vayikra 23:15.</P>
<P>2.      This appears to be the view of Ameimar (Menchot 67a).  Rashi and Tosafot indicate clearly that this is the pesak.</P>
<P>3.      Semag (Asei 200).</P>
<P>4.      See Rabbeinu Bachya (Vayikra 23:16), Ibn Ezra (Vayikra 23:11)</P>
<P>5.      Sefer ha-Chinuch (273).  He is initially troubled by the progressive nature of this counting process which might, on the surface, imply that the focus is commemorating the past (Pesach), rather than anticipating the future (Shavu'ot).  However, he resolves this by suggesting that the alternative scheme would have been discouraging in that it would have accented the distance from Shavu'ot instead of its proximity, thus dampening the enthusiasm it should generate.</P>
<P>6.      Ramban (Vayikra 23:15).</P>
<P>7.      Ramban (Vayikra 23:36), Rabbeinu Bachya (Vayikra 23:16).</P>
<P>8.      "Sacred and Profane," in Gesher III: 1 (1966), p.16.</P>
<P>9.      The idea that autonomy and freedom are central themes of talmud Torah and matan Torah requires no elaboration. The principles of "The Jews are My slaves; My slaves, and not the slaves of other slaves," and "Only someone who engages in Torah-study is free" are just two of many prooftexts that illustrate this point. The connection between yovel (Jubilee) and sefirah--a prominent theme in the midrash and commentaries--also takes on new meaning if the ultimate aim of sefirah is the time-consciousness which enhances authentic freedom.</P>
<P>10.     See, for example, Magen Avraham 489:2.</P>
<P>11.     In addition, yemei sefirah as an independent and intrinsically valuable interim period would no longer be as closely linked with the precise date of yom tov that precedes it and follows it.</P>
<P>12.     In this context, it is interesting to note that some rishonim adopt the position that weeks are only acknowledged at their completion, not daily--(Ba'al ha-Ma'or etc.). This view accents the tension between two motifs even if they are counted as one mitzvah. It is also tempting to interpret the argument between the Behag and Ba'alei ha-Tosafot along similar lines. They argue whether the entire interim period of sefirah constitutes one mitzvah, or whether each day is a distinct unit. This issue, obviously, requires some elaboration.</P>

<P>&#9;The Exodus from Egypt serves as the basis for numerous <I>mitzvot</I> and for one of the fundamental principles of our faith. The first of the Ten Commandments links the belief in God with His having freed us from Egypt. Twice daily we are obligated to acknowledge our indebtedness to God by recalling the Exodus at the conclusion of the <I>Shema</I>. In fact, R. Chaim Soloveitchik <I>zt"l</I> explains that according to the Rambam, the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>zechirat yetzi'at mitzrayim</I> (remembering the Exodus from Egypt) is not an independent obligation, but is rather an inherent part of the <I>Shema</I>, and as such is a component of our <I>kabbalat ol malchut shamayim</I> (acceptance of the yoke of heaven). </P>
<P>&#9;Even our observance of Shabbat is tied to the Exodus.  Unlike the Ibn Ezra, who explains the verse, "You shall remember that you were slaves in Egypt" (Devarim 5:14), as commanding that even slaves refrain from work on Shabbat, the Rambam and the Ramban explain this reference as a basis of <I>shemirat shabbat</I> generally. In this sense, the Talmud (Pesachim 117b) insists that we incorporate the theme of <I>yetzi'at mitzrayim</I> into the text of <I>kiddush</I>. Accordingly, the Minchat Chinuch (<I>mitzvah</I> 31) asserts that although many <I>rishonim</I> maintain that any need for wine during <I>kiddush</I> is only <I>mi-derabanan</I>, one would certainly not fulfill the Torah obligation of <I>kiddush</I> with<I> tefillah</I> alone, for nowhere in the <I>shabbat</I> evening <I>amidah</I> of  do we mention the theme of <I>yetzi'at mitzrayim</I>.</P>
<P>&#9;Even the thirty-nine <I>melachot</I> themselves are linked to the Exodus from Egypt. Tosafot (Pesachim 117b s.v. <I>le-ma'an</I>) cite the Midrash which states that on Shabbat we demonstrate our freedom by abstaining from the various forms of labor that we performed while slaves in Egypt.</P>
<P>&#9;Although <I>yetzi'at mitzrayim</I> plays such a central role in our belief, it would be incorrect to view this event as an end in itself. When Moshe Rabbeinu expresses his doubt as to his worthiness of taking the Jews out of Egypt, God assures him that the fact that the Jews would later receive the Torah makes the Exodus worthwhile (see Shemot 3:12). The very purpose and challenge of <I>yetzi'at mitzrayim</I> is to channel this newfound freedom toward the service of God. The Ramban explains that the essence and purpose of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> is to link the experience of <I>yetzi'at mitzrayim</I> with that of <I>kabbalat ha-Torah</I>. The Ramban comments that the days of <I>Pesach</I> are to be viewed as the first days of <I>yom tov</I> and the days of <I>Shavu'ot</I> as the last days of <I>yom tov</I>, with the intermediate days of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> serving as a form of <I>chol ha-mo'ed</I>. For this reason the Ravnic literature often refers to<I> Shavu'ot</I> as "<I>Atzeret</I>," the true and fitting conclusion of <I>Pesach</I>. Accordingly, R. Ovadiah Yosef (Yechaveh Da'at 1:24) argues that although the days of <I>sefirah</I> mark the tragic passing of the students of R. Akiva (see Yevamot 62b), it would be incorrect to consider this period as one of <I>aveilut</I>. Essentially these are days of great joy in anticipating <I>kabbalat ha-Torah</I>. Perhaps it is for this very reason that the Torah makes no mention of the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>simchah</I> on <I>Pesach</I>. Only on<I> Shavu'ot</I>, when the true purpose of <I>yetzi'at mitzrayim</I> is realized, does the Torah obligate us to rejoice.</P>
<P>&#9;In this sense, the Aruch ha-Shulchan (O.C. 489) explains the view of the Ramban who maintains that the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> is a Torah-obligation even today. Even without the <I>Beit ha-Mikdash</I> and the <I>minchat ha-omer </I>(the special sacrifice that was made in connection with <I>sefirat ha-omer</I>), the need to link <I>Pesach</I> to <I>Shavu'ot</I>, and thereby to see freedom as a means to further and enhance one's service of God, is as significant today as it was when the <I>Beit ha-Mikdash</I> stood.</P>
<P>&#9;Although the special sacrifices of <I>Pesach</I> and <I>Shavu'ot</I> (the <I>minchat ha-omer</I> and the <I>sh'tei ha-lechem</I>, respectively) have much in common, they are nonetheless brought from different grains. Whereas the <I>minchat ha-omer</I> is brought from barley, which the Talmud describes as <I>ma'achal beheimah</I> (food for animals), the <I>sh'tei ha-lechem</I> is from wheat, described as <I>ma'achal adam </I>(food for people). Perhaps this distinction as well can be understood given the link between <I>Pesach</I> and <I>Shavu'ot</I>. The experience of freedom, in the sense of relief from physical service and oppression, is not one which is unique to humanity. Even an animal can sense the removal of a physical burden. Hence, the <I>minchat ha-omer</I> marking this form of freedom comes from <I>ma'achal beheimah</I>. <I>Shavu'ot</I>, however, which challenges us to use this freedom wisely, to ascend in the distinctly human endeavor of acquiring holiness and enhancing our commitment to God, has its sacrifice brought from wheat, <I>ma'achal adam</I>.</P>
<I><P>&#9;Mitzvot</I> which are performed relatively infrequently are generally accompanied by the blessing of <I>shehechiyanu</I>, in which we thank God for allowing us to perform them. Why then is no <I>shehechiyanu</I> recited on the <I>mitzvah</I> of<I> sefirat ha-omer</I>? The Ba'al ha-Ma'or (end of Pesachim) explains that this blessing is only recited on <I>mitzvot</I> that possess qualities of joy When the <I>Beit ha-Mikdash</I> stood, this was true of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> and certainly the blessing of <I>shehechiyanu</I> was recited. In our time, however, <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> is only a <I>zecher le-Mikdash</I>, devoid of joy, and therefore no <I>shehechiyanu</I> is recited.</P>
<P>&#9;According to the Rambam and Rabbeinu Yeruchum, however, who maintain that the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> is a Torah-obligation even today, other reasons must be given to explain the omission of <I>shehechiyanu</I>. Rabbeinu Yeruchum explains that the <I>shehechiyanu</I> recited on <I>Shavu'ot</I> itself covers the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>sefirat ha-omer</I> as well. The very purpose of <I>sefirah</I> is to underscore the significance of <I>Shavu'ot</I>. In fact, whereas all other holidays are linked to specific calendar dates, <I>Shavu'ot</I> commences at the conclusion of the <I>sefirat ha-omer</I>. Therefore only after counting these days and successfully bridging the gap between <I>Pesach</I> and <I>Shavu'ot</I> do we recite the blessing of <I>shehechiyanu</I>.</P>
<P>&#9;The days of <I>sefirah</I> are indeed days of intense preparation and anticipation. May we be worthy recipients of <I>Torat Hashem</I>.  </P>

<P>In anticipation of <I>Rosh Ha-Shana</I> we take haircuts and dress as we do for <I>Yom Tov</I> to demonstrate that we are confident that G-d will be kind to us and judge us favorably on the Day of Judgement. Likewise, just after the close of the <I>Yom Ha-Kippurim</I> we celebrate by having a festive feast, to demonstrate again that we are confident that the judgement was a favorable one.</P>

<P>How can we be so confident? Every year tragedies do occur. Some young people die prematurely; others become impoverished. There is a lot of suffering in the world that would seem to contradict such confidence.</P>

<P>The Chazon Ish explains in his essay on <I>Emunah</I> and <I>Bitachon</I>, that when we ask a sick person to have <I>bitachon</I>, it does not mean that he should be convinced that he will recover. That would be ridiculous - one can not be sure that he will not die. <I>Bitachon </I>simply means to live by <I>emunah</I>, and <I>emunah </I>means believing that G-d has complete control over everything in the world. If G-d wants me to live and be healthy and happy, then there is nothing anyone can do to negate that. If for some reason, G-d wants me to suffer, then as that is His will, we should accept it with joy, with the knowledge that anything G-d does is for the good.</P>

<P>When someone harms another, one should not think that were it not for that individual the first person would not have suffered. We believe that <I>bechira</I> is always limited. No one has the ability to harm another person unless there was a <I>gezeirah</I> from heaven decreeing that the victim should be harmed. "No one will injure his finger on this earth unless it was so ordained from above" (<I>Chulin</I> 7b}. Once such a <I>gezeirah</I> is decreed, G-d gives everyone the ability to use his or her <I>bechirah</I> even to the extent of harming another individual. </P>

<P>We are all expected to lead our lives in accordance with these principles of <I>emunah</I>, and living by the principles of <I>emunah</I> is what it means to have <I>bitachon</I>. We are not confident that our judgement on <I>Rosh Ha-Shana</I> and <I>Yom Ha-Kippurim</I> will be in our favor. Rather, our confidence consists of our belief that G-d is all-powerful, that His will shall prevail, and that whatever He does is always <I>letov</I>, even in the event that it is detrimental to us.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the destruction of the <I>Beit HaMikdash</I>, the Jewish exiles were taken to Bavel. Sitting alongside the rivers of Bavel, the Jewish prisoners were taunted by their captors to, "Sing for us your songs of Zion." This tragic event was eternalized in the chapter of <I>Tehillim</I>, "<I>Al naharot bavel</I>". The Jewish response to this mockery were the words that have been repeated for thousands of years, "<I>Im eshcachech yerushalayim tishcach yemini</I>."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Chazal</I> explain that the Babylonians were not merely asking the Jews to play music, but they were making fun of their inability to continue to sing in the <I>Beit HaMikdash</I>. When we recite, <I>"Al naharot bavel,"</i> we are commemorating the tragedy that the, <I>"Shir shehayu haleviim omrim beveit hamikdash",</i> no longer exists. What is so unique about this loss that causes it to warrant its own form of mourning?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In <I>Devarim </I>28:47 we are told that we have an absolute obligation to perform <I>avodat</I> <I>Hashem</I> with <I>joy. Chazal</I> in <I>Erchin</I> 11a see two levels of interpretation when explaining what constitutes this mitzvah<I>.</I> In addition to the overall obligation to observe all <I>mitzvot </I>in a joyous state, this joy is primarily expressed in the <I>Beit HaMikdash</I>, specifically through the songs that accompanied the <I>korbanot</I>. This <I>shira</I> set the tone for each individual's <I>avodat Hashem</I>. Once the Beit HaMikdash was destroyed, the communal expression of <I>avodat Hashem besimcha</I> could no longer exist in the fullest sense, detracting from each individual's ability to reach the ultimate level of<I> simcha</I>. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prior to the <I>churban</I>, there was already a lack of excitement in the daily <I>avodat Hashem</I> of each individual. One of the factors to which <I>Chazal</I> attribute the <I>Churban</I> (Nedarim 661a) is not that Jews were not learning sufficiently, but that they failed to recite a <I>brachah</I> prior to their learning. Reciting a <I>brachah</I> indicates that one appreciates the gift he is receiving. One who learns but fails to say a <I>brachah</I> clearly does not approach the <I>mitzvah</I> with the proper enthusiasm. An act of <I>avodat Hashem</I> that lacks a <I>brachah</I> is not an <I>avodah besimcha</I>. The lack of <I>simcha</i> in the Jews' <I>avodat Hashem</I> helped bring about the <I>churban</I>. After the <I>churban</I> it became even more difficult to attain the correct state of mind because the source of <I>simcha</I>, the <I>shira</I> of the <I>Beit Hamikdash</I>, was gone. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the situation is bleak, it is not hopeless because we can still achieve <I>simcha</I> in our <I>avodat Hashem</I>. We have to rectify the mistake that caused the <I>churban</I> by reciting <I>birkat ha-torah</I>&nbsp;in the fullest sense. We must involve ourselves in <I>limud ha-torah</I> with excitement and joy. Just as a lack of enthusiasm brought about the destruction of the <I>Beit Hamikdash</I>, may we merit to see its rebuilding brought about through our rededication to <I>avodat Hashem besimcha</I>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"And a man will stumble over his brother  [which is interpreted 
to mean] man will stumble because of his brother's iniquity. This teaches that all 
Jews are responsible for one another (<I>areivin zeh ba-zeh</I>)" (Shavuot 39a).</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principle of <I>areivut</I> teaches that all Jews are bound 
together in a covenant of mutual responsibility and liability. The fundamental conceptual 
underpinnings of <I>areivut</I> emerge from consideration of the following <I>halachah</I>.
 "Ahavah, the son of R. Zeira taught : with regard to all the blessings the rule is that 
 even though one has fulfilled [<I>yatza</I>] his own obligation to recite a particular 
 blessing he can cause others to fulfill [<I>motzi</I>] their obligation to recite that 
 blessing [with the exception of blessings of enjoyment]" (Rosh Hashanah 29a).</P>
 
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This <I>halachah</I> of <I>yatza motzi</I> <I>primo facie</I> contradicts 
the rule of the mishna that, "whoever is not obligated in a particular matter cannot cause 
the public to discharge their obligation [vis-a-vis that matter]"(<I>ibid.</I>). Rashi and 
other Rishonim <I> ad locum</I> reconcile this apparent contradiction by explaining that 
the mishnah's rule applies to one who was never obligated in the <I>mitzvah</I>. One who 
was obligated in the <I>mitzvah</I>, however, even after having performed the <I>mitzvah</I> 
<U>remains</U> obligated by virtue of any other Jew's unfulfilled obligation and need for
 assistance. The basis for this continuing obligation is   the principle of <I>areivut</I>. </P>
 
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us briefly analyze this explanation. In order to cause others 
to fulfill their obligation vis-a-vis a particular <I>mitzvah</I>, one must be obligated in
 the same <I>mitzvah</I>. Thus it emerges that <I>areivut</I> is not an independent
  <I>mitzvah</I> or free-standing concept such as loving one's fellow Jew; rather it is 
  an integral internal component of each and every <I>mitzvah</I>. One's personal obligation 
  vis-a-vis any particular <I>mitzvah</I> dictates not only that he individually perform 
  the <I>mitzvah</I> but also that he assist any other Jew in doing the same. </P>
  
  
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us briefly digress and consider the following teaching of
 Rav Soloveitchik zt"l. The Rav often explained that Judaism conceives of the Jewish 
 nation (as well as any microcosmic Jewish community) not simply as a large aggregate 
 or massive partnership of individuals, but rather as a distinct metaphysical entity. 
 (Vide the Rav's essay "The Community" in Tradition Vol. 17, No. 2 pp. 9-10, Fn. 4. 
 See also Meshech Chochmah on the <I>haftorah</I> of <I>parshat </I>Devarim.)</P>
 
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon further reflection, in light of the Rav's teaching, it emerges that the
 concept of <I>areivut</I> reflects a fundamental Torah principle. Prior to the 
 giving of the Torah, Hashem promises the Jewish People that if they accept the Torah, "you shall 
 be My special treasure among nations...you will be a kingdom of priests and a holy 
 nation to Me,"<I> </I>(Exodus 19:5-6). Torah was not given to 600,000+ individuals. 
 Rather, the Torah was given to the Jewish people as a distinct metaphysical entity.
  Every Jew is derivatively  endowed with sanctity (<I>kedushat yisroel</I>) and is 
  obligated in <I>mitzvot</I> by virtue of his or her belonging to the Jewish nation.
   <I>Mitzvot </I> were given to the Jewish people as a whole and thus the derivative
    obligation of every individual Jew is to facilitate fulfillment of the <I>mitzvot</I> by 
	all members of the Jewish people - himself as well as others. The principle of <I>areivut</I> which 
	underlies the <I>halachah</I> of <I> yatza motzi</I> encapsulates this fundamental notion.</P>
	
	
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This concept of the Jewish People as a dictinct metaphysical entity
illumines the gemarah's phraseology regarding <i>areivut</i>.The gemarah's phrase <I>areivin zeh ba-zeh</I> is conventionally understood
 in terms of the primary meaning of the root <I>ayin-reish-bet</I>, to guarantee. 
 Hence the translation, all Jews are guarantors, or responsible for one another. 
 Nonetheless, it seems quite plausible that the phrase should be understood in light 
 of the root's secondary meaning, to mix or blend. And thus, the gemara's apothegm 
 should be understood thus, "all Jews are bound up with each other," expressing not 
 merely mutual responsibility and liability, but existential unity and identity. 
 The use of the "<I>ba</I>'", <I>"areivin zeh ba-zeh</I>" suggests this alternate 
 understanding because in Hebrew idiom when the root ayin-reish-bet connotes guaranteeing it is followed by
 the propositional letter lamed, and when it connotes mixing it is followed by the 
 propositional letter "bet". [<I>Vide </I> Chidushei ha-Ritva <I>ad locum</I> who apparently advances both interpretations.]</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recognizing the metphysical identity of the Jewish People allows us to fully appreciate 
the following teaching encoded in the Torah, decoded by our Sages. The Torah describes the Jewish people's journey to Mt. Sinai
 to receive the Torah. "<U>They</U> had departed from Rephidim and had arrived in 
 the Sinai Desert, camping (<I>vayahanu) </I> in the wilderness. <U>Israel</U> camped 
 (<I>vayehan</I>) opposite the mountain" (exodus 19:2). Our sages (Mechilta <I>ad 
 locum</I>), prompted by the Torah's apparent linguistic inconsistency in shifting 
 from the plural (<I>vayahanu</I>) to the singular (<I>vayehan</I>), comment that when 
 the Jewish people arrived at Mt. Sinai they achieved a remarkable degree of unity, 
 hitherto unattained. They were as, "one person with one heart." (<I>ibid.</I>) Hence 
 the shift from the plural to the singular form of speech. In light of the aforementioned 
 remarks, it is abundantly clear that this remarkable achievement did not coincidentally 
 precede the giving of the Torah. Rather it was a <I>sine qua non </I> for the giving of 
 the Torah to the Jewish people who, unified, emerged as a distinct metaphysical entity. As 
 long as divisions and divisiveness separated Jews, they remained individuals, unworthy 
 of the Torah. The Jewish nation crystallized and became worthy of the Torah when this remarkable state of unity was achieved. </P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And finally, appreciating the indispensability of Jewish unity to <i>matan Torah</i> provides 
insight into a famous Talmudic passage. The gemara in Masechet Yevamot records the tragic history of 
the period spanning Pesach and Shavuot during which time R. Akiva's 24,000 disciples 
perished "because they did not accord each other proper respect" [as measured by the
 highest of standards to which they, disciples of R. Akiva, were held] (<I>ibid</I> 62b). 
  Surely, the timing of the divine punishment is not happenstance, but rather is 
  determined in accordance with the sin. Every year between Pesach and Shavuot we prepare 
  ourselves to re-create the giving of the Torah. Reattaining the remarkable unity which 
  was a <I>sine qua non</I> for <I>matan Torah</I> is thus of the highest priority. At a time 
  of hightened sensitivity to and striving for unity, R. Akiva's disciples' interpersonal 
  deficiency was especially egregious and accordingly punished. </P>

<P>The <I>Gemara</I> (<I>Shabbat</I> 28a) states than an under <I>bar</I> or <I>bat</I> <I>mitzvah</I> <I>katan</I> who lit <I>ner</I> <I>Chanukah</I> did <U>nothing</U>, meaning that other household members cannot fulfill their obligation through him or her: But a woman can certainly light for the household, as women are obligated in <I>ner Chanukah</I> for they too were involved in the miracle of <I>Chanukah.</P>
</I><P>The <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> (675:3) quotes these rules, and adds: Some say that a <I>katan</I> who reached the age of <I>chinuch</I>, education, <U>can</U> light for others: The reason is that <I>Chanikah</I> is a Ravnic obligation, and a <I>katan</I> is also obligated <I>miderabanan</I>. </P>
<P>The <I>Mishna Brurah</I> (13) says that the <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> omits the view that a <I>katan</I> who reached the age of <I>chinuch</I> may read for a <I>gadol</I> concerning the <I>megilla</I> on <I>Purim</I>, which is also Ravnic : Therefore, [the similar situation] is rejected on <I>Chanukah</I> as well. However, one can distinguish as follows:</P>
<P>A <I>katan's</I> action cannot discharge a <I>gadol's</I> personal obligation, such as <I>megilla</I>, but on <I>chanukah</I> the <I>mitzvah</I> is on the household and as long as the candle has a status of <I>ner chanukah</I>, such as that of an educable <I>katan</I>, it fulfills the obligation of the househols.</P>
<P>Our custom is that every male lights with a <I>bracha</I> to fulfill the <I>mitzva</I> better, as <I>mehadrin</I>. The <I>Mishnah Berurah</I> (9) adds that a woman may make a <I>bracha</I> on her additional <I>ner Chanukah</I> , as she can on any other time-dependent <I>mitzvot</I> <I>aseh</I> such as <I>lulav</I> and <I>sukkah</I>. This statement is very difficult. A woman is obligated in <I>ner Chanukah</I> , and must make a <I>bracha</I> even if she may not make a <I>bracha</I> on <I>sukkah</I> and <I>lulav</I>, as the <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> rules, and is the Sephardic custom.</P>
<P>The answer is that a woman is not required to perform the additional level of <I>mehadrin</I>. But, this too is difficult. Why is she different from a man?</P>
<P>Apparently, women's involvement in the <I>Chanukah</I> miracle obligates them to publicize the miracle. This obligation, known as <I>pirsuma nissa</I> must be obvious to any onlooker. It is obvious that a person is looking at a <I>ner</I>. It is not obvious that <I>halachically</I> one person's lighting fulfills the lighting obligation of all household members. Therefore, women are included only in the obligation of looking at <I>ner Chanukah</I> not lighting the <I>ner</I>. Of course, if a woman lives alone she must light a <I>ner</I> in order to see it.. However, she has no obligation to light as such. </P>
<P>As a result, the idea of <I>mehadrin</I>, that all household members light separately, is incumbent only on men who are required to light. Women need not do so. If they volunteer, they can make a <I>bracha</I> just as when they volunteer to fulfill <I>sukkah</I> and <I>lulav</I>.</P>
<P> In many homes women do not volunteer to light their own <I>mehadring ner</I>- why is that? The <I>Mishna Berurah</I> says (677:16) that a married woman is not included in <I>mehadrin</I>. If she volunteers , her <I>bracha</I> may be a <I>bracha levatala</I>. Therefore, even  single women do not volunteer, to avoid either <I>bracha levatala</I> or disappointment over discontinuing lighting <I>ner Chanukah</I> upon their marriage.</P>

<P>The Rambam (Hilchos Megila Ch. 2 Hal. 17) rules that it is better to
increase the amount of money spent on <i>matanos laevyonim</i> than to
add to the lavishness of one's <i>seudah</i> and <i>mishloach manos</i>.
The reason is that there is no greater and more splendid <i>simchah</i> than
to gladden the hearts of the poor and downtrodden.  Moreover, one who gladdens
the unfortunate is compared to Hashem, who revives the spirit of the lowly
and the heart of the depressed.
</p><p>
Physical pleasure is necessarily limited. The human body can tolerate
only a small amount of meat and wine.  Therefore, in order to maximize
the mitzvah of simchah on Purim, the added dimension of helping others was
included.  Sharing with peers, mishloach manos, establishes a joyful spirit
of camaraderie. Giving to those who are needy and cannot reciprocate, matanos
laevyonim, creates an even higher level of simchah.
</p><p>
Spiritual pleasure on the other hand knows no limits.  The soul cannot be
satiated (Koheles 6:7).  Indeed, even negative insatiable drives are
corruptions of the unending desire to serve Hashem.  One who loves
money can never be fully satisfied with the money he has (ibid. 5:9).
The Medrash interprets this to mean that one who loves mitzvos is never
content with those he has performed.  Why did Chazal feel compelled
to explain the verse this way when the simple meaning is so clearly true?
The ba'alei mussar explain that Man's never-ending quest for money is
inexplicable. It must, therefore be a perversion of the inborn, unfulfillable
love for <i>mitzvos</i>.
</p><p>
What is the source of this unquenchable thirst for spiritual accomplishment?
The Rambam provides the answer.  Hashem revives the spirit of the needy.
The human soul is a part of the divine above.  Therefore, the human soul, as a
part of the infinite, has infinite capacity for fulfillment in the divine
enterprise of helping others.
</p><p>
The mitzvah to be happy on Purim is best fulfilled by assisting others and
ideally by supporting the needy. As such, <i>mishloach manos</i> is an integral
part of the mitzvah of eating and drinking on Purim.  <i>Matanos laevyonim</i>,
which more closely resembles Hashem's acts of kindness to the downtrodden
who cannot reciprocate, is the greatest and most splendid <i>simchah</i> for
the person who is able to help.
</p><p>
The Ravnic commandment of how to fulfill the obligation of Purim is patterned
after the Torah's requirement to rejoice on the <i>Shalosh Regalim</i>
together with servants, orphans, widows, and others who need financial or
social assistance (Devarim 16:11).  Indeed, the Rambam (Hilchos Yom Tov Ch.6
Hal.18) describes the joy of one who does not help the poor and the embittered
yet himself enjoys a festive meal as merely the joy of the stomach.  The
happiness of mitzvos must include gladdening the hearts of the depressed.
</p><p>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>II</center></font></p><p>

The difference between the two interpersonal mitzvos of Purim can be traced
to their very inception. The original observance of Purim in the scattered
cities included only <i>mishloach manos</i> (Esther 9:19). Only the subsequent
enactment of Mordechai, which included walled cities as well, added <i>matanos
laevyonim</i> (ibid. 20-21).
</p><p>
Moreinu HaRav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik ZT"L explained this distinction
based upon the Ramban's analysis of the historical development of Purim
recorded in the Megillah. When Haman threatened the Jews, those who lived in
walled cities were in considerably less danger than the rest of their
brethren.  Therefore, following their deliverance, the walled
city dwellers celebrated at the time of the miraculous event (ibid. 18), but not
in subsequent years on its anniversary. Only those who were in an immediate 
danger observed the 14<sup>th</sup> of Adar as a recurring holiday (ibid. 19).
</p><p>
Later, when Mordechai and his beis din instituted Purim
as an official day of joy, they realized that all Jews ought to
celebrate.  No Jew could rightly say, "Haman would not have
attacked us anyway", for Haman was the enemy of all the
Jews (ibid. 24).
</p><p>
In most of the world Purim is observed on the 14<sup>th</sup> of Adar.
In ancient walled cities it is celebrated on the 15<sup>th</sup>.
The Ramban asks, why did the Ravs, who are always concerned about
uniformity in religious observance, institute a mitzvah
with a built in dichotomy?
</p><p>
The Ramban answers that we celebrate two days to
commemorate the original enactment of Purim.  However, to emphasize that the
Jews in more vulnerable areas experienced a greater miracle, and that they were
the ones who observed Purim first, Mordechai saw fit to establish one day for
them and a subsequent day for inhabitants of walled cities. And so a dual date
for Purim emerged for all generations.
</p><p>
Rav Soloveitchik ZT"L added that this very difference
underlies the delay in the observance of <i>matanos laevyonim</i>.
Originally, when only the Jews outside walled cities celebrated
Purim, the lesson of the common destiny of all Jews was not
fully appreciated.  Therefore, only the mitzvah of mishloach
manos, representing closeness with one's peers, was observed.
Mordechai's enactment included the walled cities to emphasize
the unity of the Jewish people. To do so, he added not only
a different date, but also the mitzvah of matanos laevyonim.
Helping the disadvantaged reinforces the notion that all
are united and must care for one another.
</p><p>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>III</center></font></p><p>

The importance of Jewish unity on Purim can explain an enigmatic statement
attributed to the Arizal.  Yom Kippur is called Yom Kippurim, which the
Arizal reads as Yom K'-Purim - a day like Purim.  Since Yom Kippur is a much
holier day than Purim, why is Yom Kippur compared to Purim?
</p><p>
The ba'alei mussar suggest that the statement of the Arizal
refers to the interpersonal dimension of these two days.
On Yom Kippur, we must seek unity. Forgiveness is
contingent upon appeasing a fellow Jew (Yoma 85b).
The day is described as one which does not contain hatred,
jealousy, or competition (Musaf).  The fast must involve
sinners, just as the ketores included a foul-smelling spice,
<i>chelbena</i> (Krisus 6b).  The very name <i>Tzom</i>, fast, is related
to <i>Tzamah</i>, a braid which symbolizes the unity of different strands
within the Jewish community (Rav Soloveitchik). Purim also
stresses togetherness. Haman's statement that the Jews were
spread out and divided (ibid. 3:8) reflected our disunity.
Esther's exhortation to gather all the Jews of Shushan (ibid.
4:16) teaches that Jews must unite, especially in times of
crisis.
</p><p>
The mitzvos of the day reflect the same theme. The Megillah should be read
in a large assemblage (Mishnah
Berurah Orach Chaim 689 note 16). Mishloach manos and,
especially, matanos laevyonim reinforce the need for Jews to 
assist their friends and, especially, the disadvantaged.
</p><p>
The Arizal maintains that the unity of Yom Kippur
exists in an unnatural state. In the absence of work and physical pleasure,
Jewish unity is more readily achieved.  As such, it is hardly a precedent
for the rest of the year.
</p><p>
In this sense, Purim is greater than Yom Kippur.  Work is permitted and
eating and drinking are mandatory.  Unity under such circumstances is a greater
accomplishment and a better example for other days as well.
</p><p>
Purim and Yom Kippur share another common factor.
They are both days of <i>kabbalas haTorah</i>.  The second <i>luchos</i>
were given on Yom Kippur (Rashi Shmos 34:29).
And the second, compelling acceptance of the Torah took place during the story
of Purim (Shabbos 88a).
</p><p>
This is no coincidence. The Torah can be given only
when there is Jewish unity.  At the original kabbalas haTorah on Shavuos,
the singular form (VaYechan) is used in reference to <i>Am Yisrael</i>
(Shmos 19:2).  Rashi explains: as one person with one heart.
This prerequisite for receiving the Torah was recreated on Yom Kippur and
during the story of Purim with similar results.
</p><p>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>IV</center></font></p><p>

Jewish unity cannot possibly be realized without authentic Torah leadership,
which requires humility and concern
for others. Moshe Rabbeinu was our greatest leader and
the humblest of men.  He gave us the Torah on Shavuos and
Yom Kippur.  On Purim, the Torah was reaccepted 
under leadership of Mordechai.
</p><p>
Although his humility is not stated openly in the
Megillah, an insight can be gleaned from the cantillation
(<i>ta'amei hamikrah</i>) of the Megillah.  Two <i>psukim</i> - 3:12 and 8:9
recount the calling of the scribes to write the king's orders in nearly
identical terms. In the first, Haman's commands were written; in the second, 
Mordechai's.
</p><p>
The emphasis, as denoted by the highest and longest cantillation, known as the
<i>pazer</i>, is remarkably different.  In Chapter 3, the Pazer is on the word
"Haman". In Chapter 8, Mordechai's name is read with the least significant note
(munach), and the emphasis of <i>Pazer</i> is reserved for the word "Yehudim,"
the Jews. This is the fundamental difference between the two types of leaders.
Generally, leaders are largely concerned about their own welfare, as was Haman
and the Megillah drops us a hint of this by stressing his name as he would
have. Authentic Torah leaders, such as Mordechai, however, are devoted to the
Jewish people in general, and the people who follow them in particular.
Their own needs are downplayed and muted similar to the note on Mordechai's
name, and the needs of the Jew are emphasized.</P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Gemara in Yevamot (62b) relates the story of the death of Rav Akiva's talmidim. Twelve thousand pairs of his students dies during one period because they did not respect one another. The Me'iri comments that these talmidim dies between Pesach and Lag be-Omer, and for this reason it is customary not to marry during this period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of questions can be raised concerning this matter. First, why does the Talmud refer to twelve thousand pairs of talmidim rather than twenty-four thousand talmidim? Second, how is it possible that Rav Akiva's talmidim did not have basic respect for one another? Third, why was this tragedy singled out for perpetual commemoration during the period of Sefirah? Finally, how did the custom of refraining from marriage (in contrast to other forms of aveilut which were not originally practiced) reflect the tragedy of the sefirah period?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the answer to these questions is as follows. Although Rav Akiva's students were generally respectful to one another, they were deficient in one area. Each talmid had a chavrusa, a friend and study partner, with whom he would learn all day, under Rav Akiva's guidance. The unique relationship, which blossoms when two individuals join in the difficult and incessant challenge of attempting to master the divine law to the best of their abilities, should also produce a paramount mutual respect, far beyond the standard requirement to honor a friend. Rav Akiva's students lacked this lofty, but essential part of the chavrusa.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For this reason, the Gemara tells of twelve thousand pairs of talmidim, highlighting the lack of sufficient respect accorded to one member of the pair by the other. This lesson is so important that it bears constant reinforcement during sefirah, which is not only the anniversary of the tragedy, but also the period of preparation for the reacceptance of the Torah on Shavuout.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each year during sefirah we read of the mitzvah to love one's friend as oneself (Vayikra 19:18). The obvious question is raised; how can one be expected to love every Jew as oneself? Rav Akiva's famous comment, cited by Rashi, that this mitzvah is a great rule in the Torah ("Ba-Torah"), also requires explanation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chasam Sofer raises an additional question. The above statement of Rav Akiva seems to contradict his famous ruling (B.M. 62a): "Your life takes priority over your friend's." How can this be reconciled with the command to love your friend as yourself?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To answer this question, the Chasam Sofer reinterprets the word "Ba-Torah" in Rav Akiva's first statement. It does not mean that loving a friend is a great rule which is written in the Torah. Rather, it means that it is a great rule concerning the study of the Torah. While in the area of physical survival and attainment one's own life and possessions have priority, in the spiritual realm one must share his Torah knowledge equally with others. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps this idea can be modified in light of the above. Rav Akiva refers to the special chavrusa relationship which is critical to the study of Torah. while a person cannot be expected to love every Jew as he loves himself, he must love and honor his chavrusa as himself in all ways and at all times and not only while sharing Torah knowledge. Otherwise, the relationship is not a truly spiritual one, and its members are worthy of punishment for not internalizing the spirituality of Torah. In this respect, Rav Akiva's statement reflects the terrible tragedy of his students' death, which illustrates the importance of loving one's chavrusa as oneself and the catastrophic results of loving this command. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Talmudic passage containing the story of Rav Akiva's talmidim continues and promises peace to one who loves his wife as himself and honors her more than himself. At first glance, this statement is puzzling. After all, a person is commanded to love everyone as himself. Why then is his wife singled out?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In light of the above interpretation of Rav Akiva's statement and the deficiency of his students, the answer is clear. Indeed, the command to love one's friend as oneself is limited to a deep spiritual relationship between two people. A man's relationship with his wife must be a spiritual one that reflects the ideals of Torah, and, as such, requires that he love her as himself, and honor her even more than himself (see Rashi). If a husband loves and honors his wife in a way which reflects his recognition of the deep spiritual nature of their relationship , he is promised peace and happiness in marriage. Otherwise, he is doomed to suffer misery and tragedy, just like Rav Akiva's students; they did not recognize the full measure of the spiritual nature of their relationship with one another, and as a result, did not love and honor each other sufficiently.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is perhaps for this reason that the custom evolved to avoid marriages during the sefirah period. Since other aspects of aveilut were not practiced, the establishment of the custom to abstain from marriage was not a form of mourning for the death of Rav Akiva's students. Rather, it was felt that this period was not a propitious time for marriage. At a time when the true meaning of a deep one-to-one Torah relationship was ignored, it is not appropriate to begin such a relationship between husband and wife. While the command to love and honor another as oneself may be limited to one-to-one relationships, it is clear that all relationships based on Torah require mutual love and respect, commensurate with the intensity and spirit of the relationship. Let us attempt to develop appropriate levels of love and honor towards all Jews in general, and towards spouses, parents, rebbeim, and fellow talmidim in particular. In this zechut, may we merit a true commemoration of kabbalat ha-Torah and the hastening of our ultimate redemption. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The shul's customs regarding <I>piyutim</I> and <I>nigunim</I> must be preserved. Changes may confuse the congregants and are considered a serious offence. The traditional <I>nigunnim</I> for <I>Borchu, Kaddish,</I> and <I>Kedusha</I> should be used.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Rav Soloveitchik<I> zt'l</I> explained that the tenth <I>pasuk</I> of <I>Malchuyot</I>-<I>Shema</I> <I>Yisrael</I>- essentially belongs to the subsequent <I>bracha</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <I>parasha</I> of <I>Bamidbar </I>is read annually before the <I>yom tov</I> of<I>Shavu'ot</I>.  In <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> O"C 428, we find <I>minu ve-ratzu</I> which means count and celebrate <I>Shavu'ot</I>.  The Torah teaches that the mandate to count <I>Benai Yisrael</I> is couched in the phrase <I>"Se'u et rosh</I>" which means literally "lift the head" or "elevate" the nation of Israel.  How is counting an elevation?  The <I>Ramban</I> in his commentary (4:13) explains that counting each individual is acknowledging that each person has self-worth, importance, and dignity. You are not only important because you are part of the nation of Israel, but you have your own purpose and mission as well.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;It is interesting to note that each person's EKG is different one from another,  and no two people have the same fingerprints.  Our Ravs couch this idea as <I>"Kesheim she-ein partzufeihen shavin kach ein</I> <I>dei'oteihem shavin</I>."  By this they mean that each person is unique not only physically, but in intelligence and character as well. Because each person possesses a unique temperament, his spiritual challenges and his <I>yetzer ha-ra</I> are also relevant only to him. Therefore, each person's service of God is different from everyone else's.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;While the book of <I>Bamidbar</I> begins with the important message of the worth of each man individually, each person is counted as part of <I>Benei Yisrael</I>.  This dual nature might well be compared to a symphony orchestra.  The ultimate beautiful end result is the integration and blending of each instrument.  However, unless each musician fine-tunes his or her instrument, and practices to perfection, the sum which is even greater than all its individual parts will be lacking. "<I>Minu ve-ratzu</I>" might therefore require that we develop our own individuality to be able to join the collective <I>kabbalat ha-Torah</I> of <I>Shavu'ot</I>.  Moreover, this directive of "<I>minu ve-ratzu</I>" - really thrusts a major philosophic difficulty on thinking Jews.  On the one hand we have stressed our own individual <I>avodat Hashem</I>.  On the other hand, the greatness of <I>kaballat ha-Torah</I> is <I>"ke-ish echad be-leiv echad</I>," joining with the rest of the Jewish nation.  How is one to budget his time and energies between their own needs for growth and those of others?  The <I>Maharsha</I> in his commentary (<I>Sanhedrin</I> 99b) suggests that "<I>adam le-amel yulad</I>" (People are born to work,")  <I>le-amel</I> is an acronym for "<I>Lilmod al menat le-lamed</I>" - to study and master in order to share and teach to others.  What scale  should we use to determine how to balance our personal studying, which as we know never ends, and our communal responsibility, which likewise seems never ending?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Rav Shimon Shkop zt"l in his introduction to <I>Sha'arei Yosher</I> writes that just as in the physical/ material realm we are commanded "<I>Asser te-aaser</I>" (<I>Devarim</I> 14:22), to tithe our possessions on behalf of the Levites, and the poor (depending on the year) and are promised that doing so will bring us blessing, so too regarding the realm of the soul - we are to give a tenth of our time to helping others.  (Giving to others is the best way to insure one's wealth).  Moreover, the more we give, the more we are promised God will bless us.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Similarly, the <I>Meshech Chachmah</I> in his commentary on  "<I>Va-yachel Noach ish ha-adamah</I>" ("Noach debased himself as a man of the earth" - Bereishit 9:20) cites the <I>midrash</I> which contrasts the Torah's depiction of Noach, first as " a righteous man" and subsequently as a "man of the earth," with its description of Moshe <I>Rabbeinu</I>, who is initially referred to as "an Egyptian man" but who ultimately becomes a "man of God." He explains that there are two different ways to serve God.  One is to isolate oneself from the community and focus completely on oneself.  The other way is to be involved in and with the needs of the community.  Logic dictates, reasons Rav Meir Simchah ha-Cohen of Devinsk, that the former will excel to develop himself and his true potential, while the latter, involved with the needs of others, will not be able to attain that level of greatness and maturity.  The reality, points out the <I>midrash </I>is just the reverse.  Through our helping others, we ultimately help ourselves the most.  May we all be <I>zocheh</I> to reach out and spiritually touch not only those around us, but ultimately ourselves, ensuring our successful personal and communal <I>kabbalat ha-Torah</I>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">        After Avram's dramatic victory over the four kings and the successful rescue of Lot and the return of all the captives, Hashem reassures Avram: "<I>Al tira Avram, anochi magein lach, s'char'cha harbei m'od</I>" -- "Do not fear Avram, I am your shield, your reward is very great." (15:1)  To this promise, Avram responds: "<I>Hashem Elokim, mah titen li, v'anochi holeich ariri</I>" -- "God Almighty, what will you give me since I go through life childless." (15:2) Many commentaries raise a perplexing problem with Avram's answer.  Clearly, Avram, who had discovered the truth of the One and Only G-d independently and against the prevailing theology of paganistic polytheism prevalent in his time period, surely also arrived at the truths of the transcendence of the soul and <I>'Olam Haba</I> -- the World to Come -- the world of true and everlasting reward.  How did Avram know that Hashem's promise of "great reward" was not referring to Avram's reward in the hereafter?  The Malbim addresses this question by formulating a fundamental principle concerning the nature of the everlasting reward.  The spiritual delights of <I>'Olam Haba</I> are not "<I>schar</I>" -- reward -- which implies something extra, not built into the very system of creation.  The soul is not "rewarded" for its service of G-d any more than one who diligently studies is "rewarded" with wisdom.   The acquired knowledge is a natural consequence of the study; so too, the "reward" of <I>'Olam Haba</I> is a natural consequence of the elevation of the soul that served its Creator.  It is for this reason, posits the Malbim, that the reward in <I>'Olam Haba</I> is not mentioned more explicitly in the Torah <I>Shebichtav</I> (the written Torah) (although it is alluded to (see Maimonides, Introduction to Perek Cheilek)) whereas reward in <I>'Olam Hazeh</I> is mentioned countless times.  The reward of the next world is a fundamental axiom of the very creation of the soul and its mission in this world; the reward of this world is an additional act of kindnes that the Merciful One bestows on His creations (see also Ramban (Vayikra (26:12)) and Ruach Chaim on Avot (3:1)).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">        R. Chaim Volozhiner in his Nefesh Hachaim (1:12) expounds on this concept further.  The reward of <I>'Olam Haba</I> is created by Man himself.  Each time the person performs a Mitzva, the spiritual radiance created by that Mitzva is transferred into the next world and awaits its creator to benefit from it.  Thus, explains Rav Chaim, in a very literal sense, "<I>s'char mitzva - mitzva</I>" (Avot 4:2), the reward of a mitzva is (created by) the mitzva itself.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">        The Ohr Hachayim expresses a similar theme.  In explanation of the <I>passage "V'sham'ru b'nei Yisrael et Hashabbat la'asot et hashabbat l'dorotam</I>" -- "And the Jewish people should keep the Shabbat, in order that they perform (literally make) the Shabbat for all generations," he explains that by the Jewish people keeping the this-worldly Shabbos, they actively create (hence "make") their reward in the next world which is referred to as the "<I>Yom Shekulo Shabbos</I>" -- the day that is eternally Shabbos (See Tamid 7:4).  Thus, the observance of Shabbat quite literally creates another, everlasting Shabbat for the observer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">        In his Mesillat Yesharim (Chap. 1), R. Luzzato begins his classic work with the statement "a person needs to know his goal...that Man was created to partake in delight from God and to enjoy the splendor of the Divine radiance." Now, the highest form of Divine service is one in which the <I>'Oveid Hashem</I> serves G-d not in order to receive reward but purely because it is right (see Avot 1:3, and Rambam (T'shuva 10:1); however, see Ruach Chaim (1:3) and commentary of Chazon Yoel (footnote 877) by R. Yoel Sperka to Nachmanides' Sha'ar Ha'Gmul).  However, certainly, as the Mesillat Yesharim indicates, a heightened awareness of the immeasurable spiritual pleasure awaiting the servants of G-d as well as an understanding of the immense power endowed in mankind by their Creator to actively create this reward should propel us toward an increased devotion to the Divine Will.  Furthermore, a realization of our ultimate destination should place all of the vicissitudes and trials of life in the proper perspective and enable us to emphasize performance of Hashem's commandments.</P></FONT>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(5:4)"And the Jews did so, and they sent them  [those who were <I>tameh</I>, had <I>tzora'as</I> or were <I>zavim</I>] out of the camp as Hashem had told Moshe".  There are many occasions in which the Torah reports that obligations were performed in accordance with Hashem's instructions, and all are appropriately noted as  "<I>ka'asher tzivah</I>" - as Hashem commanded.   However in an observation that only Rav  Meir Simcha  of Dvinsk could make, he notes that the <I>pasuk</I> quoted here is  the only time in Torah where Hashem's  instructions  were carried  out "<I>ka'asher <U>dibeir</I></U>" - as Hashem <U>spoke</U>.  Throughout all of Noah's preparations for the Mabul, he is described as following the command of Hashem,  "And Noah [brought all the animals into the <I>Teivah</I>] - <I>ka'asher tzivah</I> - as Hashem commanded him"  (6:22).  "And Avraham performed the <I>bris</I> on his son Yitzchak,who was eight days old - <I>ka'asher tzivah</I>  - as Hashem commanded him" (21:4).  "And they went and they [brought the korban pesach] as Moshe and Aharon were commanded  (Ex12:28)".   The record of the gifts that were brought for the building of the mishkan is punctuated with the refrain, <I>ka'asher tzivah Hashem</I>  - as Hashem commanded.   Why then is the reference to the mitzvah of sending some individuals who are <I>tameh </I>out of the camp, said to be observed <I>ka'asher diber</I> - as Hashem spoke.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rav  Meir  Simcha  in his commentary to  the  Torah,  Meshech Chochma,  answers  that  the  word "<I>tzivah</I>" does not simply mean command.  Rather, <I>ka'asher tzivah</I> implies encouragement, prodding, perhaps even demanding.  <I>Ka'asher tzivah</I> indicates acts of obeisance alone, which are void of any anticipation of great satisfaction and certainly empty of any self serving consequences.  Indeed Rashi at the beginning of Parshas Tzav reminds us that the very usage of "<I>tzav</I>" indicates that the loss of money associated with the <I>korban olah</I> required greater encouragement than other mitzvos. However, remarks the Meshech Chochma, sending the <I>tameh</I> out of the camp, was welcomed by the <I>tameh</I> as it would achieve <I>kaparah</I>, forgiveness and a reinstatement of his position in the eyes of Hashem. That did not require any additional encouragement and was carried out, "<I>ka'asher  dibeir</I>,"  as something  unceremoniously  taught to Moshe, with no push  or fanfare.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> It would seem to me that there is another insight lurking in the Meshech Chochma's observation.   Mitzvos that are observed "<I>ka'asher tzivah</I>", are by virtue of the added encouragement, informed with the vigor, passion and pride of one who sees oneself as doing the Creator's bidding.   One can only imagine that all the misgivings that Noach had about the oncoming destruction notwithstanding, he must have been exhilarated to be chosen to ensure the survival of all that Hashem had wrought. Surely the paternal pain felt at the time of Yitzchak's bris was overwhelmed by the joy that filled Avraham, as he witnessed the continuation of all that he sought to bring into this world.   There is no question that the bris was performed <I>ka'asher  tzivah</I>.  Can one doubt that the Jews leaving Egypt were joyous beyond description as they brought the <I>Korban Pesach</I> signaling their nascent redemption?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However there is one mitzvah that we understood on our own to carry out in a begrudging manner  - "<I>ka'asher diber</I>", because He said so, as an act of obeisance.  Asking someone to leave the camp, even if it is because he is <I>tameh</I> and even if he welcomes the opportunity for <I>kaparah</I>, is one of the hard realities of communal life that Hashem has on occasion demanded of us.  The Jews understood that the manner in which this mitzvah is exercised must communicate the hesitation always inherent in distancing Jew from Jew. When a destructive attitude or a negative influence has to be separated away, it must be done with the visible pain of someone doing one's duty and devoid of the satisfaction that should otherwise highlight all service to Hashem.   In so doing one remains true to the love of every Jew that must guide all interactions with others.</P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(26:53- 55) "To <B>these </B>[the families entering Israel under <I>Yehoshua</I>] the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.  To the more numerous you shall give more and to the fewer you shall give less....  Nevertheless the land shall be divided by lot<B> according to the names of the tribes of their fathers</B> they shall inherit"  </P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In interpreting the <I>pesukim </I>above, <I>Rashi </I>understands that while the <I>Torah </I>refers to the individual's acquisition of Israel as an inheritance ("<I>yerusha</I>"), it in fact was far different from the laws and mechanics of inheritance that we study today. The initial system of inheritance of the land of Israel described in the <I>pesukim</I> is the only legacy that has the deceased receiving from those still alive.  <I>Rashi </I>explains that the land was first divided equally amongst those entering Israel and then combined and reapportioned to their parent, i.e. the senior family member who left <I>Mitzrayim</I>.   Finally it was equally divided between the heirs of those that labored in <I>Mitzrayim </I>and personally experienced the miraculous redemption.  What does the <I>Torah </I>wish to teach us through this most unusual manner of patrimony?</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <I>Torah </I>is instructing us to appreciate that even the most momentous accomplishments of any single generation, even those accomplishments that seemed far beyond the reach of parents and grandparents, are the cumulative results of the efforts of several generations.  There is no doubt that the Jews entering the land were a courageous and awe inspiring group. They conquered powerful nations and they witnessed the crumbling walls of <I>Yericho</I>. Their <I>bitachon </I>did not fail them and no sin of spies or a golden calf delayed their ascent.  They were to be the first to enact all the laws of the <I>Torah, </I>from <I>Mishkan </I>worship to the intricate laws of tithing. If there was a generation whose families' names should be associated with the allotment of the Holy Land and the subsequent harvests of plenty, surely it should be "<B>these</B>" pioneers. Therefore the <I>Torah </I>established that they should determine the size of every family's hold on the land. Those privileged to live in Israel will forever point to that generation in explaining why they have a rolling expanse in Israel or a quaint fertile portion. </P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the <I>Torah </I>stresses that the generation who merited to leave Egypt, despite the decree barring their entry into Israel,<I> </I>are so much a part of the destiny of our nation and our land, that they too must be engRaved in its very terrain. They who had suffered the pains of oppression and enslavement, who had borne witness to the greatest miracles of all, who as a group were of unparalleled prophecy, and who were marked by their unfailing devotion to follow G-d into barrenness, should not be forever judged by momentary failings, no matter how perplexing. After all, were these first settlers not readied for their mission through the yearning of the <I>Dor Hamidbar </I>(the preceding generation that had spent 40 years in the desert), strengthened by the faith nurturing experiences of their parents?  Did not the nation as a whole need the maturation cast upon them through the suffering of their parents and were they not to absorb into their blood the faithful optimism of their mothers?</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my mind the recognition of the interplay between generations was brought to life in a response of Rav<I> </I>Yechiel Michel Tuckazinski, one of the saintly giants of Jerusalem, to one of the burning questions of this century. He addressed himself to the secular Zionists of his day, who correctly displayed singular pride in their energies which had been selflessly invested into the forerunner and early stages of the State of Israel.  They expressed that their contribution to our nation had far surpassed the accomplishments of the leadership of the "<I>chareidim</I>" of their time. Rav Tuckazinski validated their feelings of having left an immeasurable legacy.  Nevertheless, he continued, none of this would ever have happened had there not been generations of Jews who kept the passionate love of Israel afire through their thrice daily yearnings for the land and its restoration. </P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our own generation often takes great pride in the increased focus on <I>mitzvah </I>observance and <I>Torah </I>study that we are experiencing.  Would any of this be happening if not for the visionary individuals and their selfless supporters who established <I>yeshivot </I>and day schools throughout the United States during a time that was altogether insensitive to the spiritual yearnings of the Jew?</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This interdependence of several generations and the understanding that any attachment to <I>Torah </I>and Israel is grounded in the inspirations and accomplishments of earlier times is well communicated through the settling of Israel, and as such is to become an uncompromising part of our thinking.</P></FONT>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fearing the enmity of his brother and the varied dangers of the road, departing from the land of Israel, something his father was not allowed to do, and thus feeling distant from is parents and their mission,  Ya'akov formulates the first Ma'ariv prayer  and introduces the concept of , galus prayer, <I>tefilah b'es tzoro</I> - prayer in troubled times - into our mesorah.   Medrash suggests that he preceded King David's "<I>Eso einai el heharim - mei'ayin yavo ezri - I lift my eyes to the  mountains, from where will my help come" </I> and recited with a slight but telling change, "<I>Eso eini el hehoirim - I lift my eyes to the parents".  </I>Chazal see this Ya'akov's prayer in the unusual phrase, "<I>VaYifga Bamakom VaYolen Shom - And He encountered the place and he slept there</I>"  and point out that it is a double entendre telling two stories at once. It can be translated, and Rashi quotes the proof texts to support this, as "He pleaded in the place"  connoting  that he prayed there. Additionally this pasuk tells the story of Ya'akov's arrival at the northern border of Israel forcing him to realize that he had long passed Yerushalayim the sight where father and grandfather prayed and brought their supreme sacrifice. Instead of having Ya'akov return all the way to Har Hamoriah Hashem brings it to him and meets him part way.  It seems to me that this double entendre characterizes the prayers of times that encompass the uncertainty of being far from one's own land, the agony of missed opportunities and the excitement of seeing Hashem turn encounter into  orchestrated rendezvous, namely the prayers of Ya'akov's Diaspora progeny.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why the emphasis on place?  He chanced upon <U>the</U> place... and He slept <U>there</U>... and He slept in <U>that</U> place.   Whereas  Abraham returns to the very  mountain where he had stood to pray on behalf of Sodom to formulate the shacharis and Yitzchak chooses the field from which to contribute to us the mincha, Ya'akov needs "the place" - a place which is drenched with meaningful dedication of his parents and his children to Hashem's will. Apparently, to focus on the spiritual and the long lasting in the whirlwind of personal or national nights,  one needs to be in a place  that inspires, offers a quiet respite allowing one to focus, and also directing our attention to Yerushalayim.  Perhaps Ya'akov established for us the importance of  davening in a makom tefilah - a beis haknesses, especially when distanced from Har Hamoriah,  when it becomes a mikdash me'at as well.  Indeed, Daniel when he turned to Hashem from Bavel, describes how in the quiet privacy of his home he stresses that he opened the windows facing Yerushalyim.  Perhaps it is in a beis haknesses that one can most easily connect with the memories and the hopes of the <I>horim - </I>those who have come before  and whose dedication and contributions can often be a source of great inspiration.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the medrash reads "Once Ya'akov made up  his mind to return to Yerushalyim" Hashem brought the mikdash to Ya'akov.   Remarks HaRav Ya'akov Moshe Charlop, that Ya'akov showed all later generations that heartfelt inspiration, and yearning that is as deep as  it is painful will flash in front of us moments of redemption and the closeness reserved for the holiest of places even from the far flung recesses of galus. </P>

		<title><![CDATA[Sefer Vayikra: A Halachic Stream of Consciousness]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Yaakov Neuburger]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[1999]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vayikra]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<I><P>&#9;Sefer Vayikra</I> begins with the <I>Mishkan</I> service, whose details will comprise most of the book.  Though its devotion to this theme clearly distinguishes <I>Sefer Vayikra</I> from the other books of the Torah,  it also links it to <I>Sefer Shemot</I>, which culminated in the <I>Mishkan's</I> construction and establishment as the place of God's residence amongst the Jewish people.  In fact, on a deeper level, the Ramban points out that <I>Sefer Vayikra</I> really protects the accomplishments made in <I>Sefer Shemot</I>, in which the Jews were redeemed from Egyptian slavery and were promised that God would dwell amongst them.  By providing the rules of the <I>Mishkan</I> service, <I>Sefer Vayikra</I> sought to ensure that God's presence would not be driven away by the sins of the Jews, which could now be atoned for by offering sacrifices.  </P>
<P>&#9;But <I>Sefer Vayikra</I> is much more than a detailed description of the laws of sacrifices and <I>taharot</I>.  The text will take us far afield, teaching us the laws of <I>kashrut</I>, the prohibitions on <I>cheilev</I> and blood, and the laws of incest and adultery.  We will also learn many of the laws of tithing in <I>Sefer Vayikra</I>, as well as the laws of <I>sh'mitah</I> and charity.  The Ramban explains that <I>Sefer Vayikra</I> included these laws because of its kind of "stream of consciousness" style, which leads to the study of issues that are tangential to the main themes of the book.</P>
<P>&#9;Nevertheless, the chosen style is troubling.  Surely there is a more efficient format in which to communicate laws; the Rambam's <I>Mishneh Torah</I>, the <I>Shulchan Aruch</I>, and a host of other texts that have shaped our <I>mesorah</I> throughout history have all been carefully structured and organized.  Why was <I>Sefer Vayikra</I> not written in the same way?</P>
<P>&#9;Rav Nisan Alpert <I>zt"l</I> suggested that by using this style the Torah teaches us several insights.  In his <I>sefer</I>, <I>Limudei Nisan</I>, he speculates that by making us learn scores of <I>halachot</I> from the book of the <I>chumash</I> that is otherwise dedicated to the rules and regulations of the <I>Mishkan</I> service, the Torah underscores the connection between the <I>Mishkan</I> and <I>talmud Torah</I>.  We are being reminded that just as the <I>Mishkan</I> service assures our connection with God, so too does the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>talmud Torah</I>.</P>
<P>&#9;Additionally, Rav Alpert suggests that <I>Sefer Vayikra</I>--called "<I>Torat Kohanim</I>" by Chazal--includes many different <I>halachot</I>&nbsp;among the laws of the <I>Mishkan</I> to stress that the role of the <I>kohanim</I> is also to teach <I>Torah</I>. In the words of the prophet (<I>Malachi</I> 2:7), "<I>Ki siftei kohanim yishmeru da'at</I>" ("The lips of the <I>kohanim</I> will protect our wisdom); for <I>kohanim</I>, the physical duties performed in the <I>Mishkan</I> are only one facet of a lifestyle dedicated to teaching the Jewish people and tending their spiritual needs and growth.</P>
<P>&#9;Finally and most importantly, Rav Alpert saw in the structure of <I>Sefer Vayikra</I> the  model for the style that we now view as characteristic of the <I>mishnah</I> and, even more so, the <I>gemara</I>.  The free style of discussion which moves easily from one topic to another and often follows tangential connections suggests that students of <I>Torah</I> should be familiar with the wide range of subjects it contains.  Not only are Ravnic laws modeled after Torah-laws, but we can now appreciate that the very style of the <I>Torah she-Ba'al Peh</I> is rooted in the style of the <I>Torah she-bi-K'tav</I>.  The entire <I>Talmud</I> was composed in the style of the book of <I> Vayikra</I>, the only book of <I>Torah she-bi-K'tav</I> dedicated almost entirely to<I> halachah</I>.</P>
<P>&#9;Moreover, through this style of <I>halachic</I> composition the Torah informs us that no <I>parshah</I> (section) of Torah should be studied or practiced in a vacuum.  No <I>halachah</I> can be fully appreciated without seeing it as part of a complete regimen of practices and behaviors.  Any single <I>halacha</I> can have its intended impact on our spirits only when observed in concert with all of Torah.  The <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>se'udat yom tov</I>, for example, must be considered alongside the prohibition against <I>bal tash'chit</I>; the permissibility of <I>shechitah</I> comes together with the prohibition of <I>tza'ar ba'alei chayim</I> and the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>shilu'ach ha-kan</I>.  The same legal system that demands the destruction of <I>Amaleik</I> or an <I>ir ha-nidachat</I> also appreciates the plight of the stranger, orphan, or widow.  We believe in <I>shabbat</I> and in <I>Torah</I>-study, but we also have a work ethic.  Any attempt to view parts of Torah in a vacuum, however efficient they may be, can lead to a distorted understanding of Torah.  A <I>ben-</I> or <I>bat-Torah</I> should be raised from his or her earliest years to know that <I>shabbat</I>, <I>kashrut</I>, <I>lashon ha-ra</I> and <I>geneivat da'at</I> are all threads of a single beautiful tapestry which can tear and unRavel if pulled in different directions.</P>
<P>&#9;Rav Alpert saw the same notion in <I>Parshat Mishpatim</I>.  Immediately following the story of <I>matan Torah</I> in <I>Parshat Yitro</I>, the <I>chumash</I> there confronts us with the laws pertaining to such varied subjects as altar-construction, slavery, property rights, torts, theft, and idolatry, to name but a few.  Its goal is to introduce us right after Sinai to the warp and woof of Torah Law, a massive legal body that God devised to address and shape different kinds of people in all walks of life, to enhance everyone's spirituality and consciousness of the divine.</P>

		<date><![CDATA[1999]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: matot]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Parshat Matot</I> begins with a discussion of certain aspects of <I>nedarim-shavuah</I>, including the prohibition of "<I>lo yahel devaro</I>" which is engendered when an individual fails to adhere to his verbal commitment. The Torah's presentation of these laws is unusual and noteworthy. Only in this context does Moshe <I>Rabbenu</I> dramatically depart from his usual protocol. Instead of teaching these laws to the entire Jewish people, he addresses these <I>halakhot</I> specifically to its leadership! Moreover, one senses a measure of urgency in Moshe's introductory remarks--" this is the matter which God has commanded (<I>zeh ha-davar asher zivah Hashem</I>)". This rare formulation (which appears again only regarding the prohibition of <I>shehutei huz</I>), directed to an extremely elite audience, seems to convey the special import and broader significance of the
message. The term "<I>lo yahel</I>" itself demands clarification and is subject to much speculation among the commentators. [See also Rashbam <I>ad loc</I>.;<I>Hagigah</I>10a; <I>Nedarim</I> 81b etc.] Rashi renders it as the secularization or profanation of one's word, implying that the norm entails a standard of <I>kedushah</I>-sanctity, though <I>nedarim</I> might relate to matters with little or no obvious connection to the sacred realm. The term "<I>neder la-Hashem</I>" in this context is similarly problematic. While each of these anomalies has invited discussion and has inspired explanations and insights in their own right, perhaps one can pursue a more holistic approach to these various phenomena. A brief analysis of some elements of <I>nedarim</I> may illuminate the Torah's presentation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The core concept underlying the very institution of <I>nedarim</I> is that the religious world of the <I>halakhah </I>constitutes its own independent and compelling spiritual reality. By establishing <I>neder</I> as an "<I>issur hefza</I>" (a status that inheres in and transforms the said object itself, though often only vis a vis the individual who commits himself to this status), the Talmud (<I>Nedarim </I>2b) makes a powerful statement about the broader scope and nature of the <I>halakhic </I>world view. The fact that this "<I>halakhic</I> reality" extends beyond <I>nidrei heqdesh</I> or even <I>nidrei mizvah</I> into neutral realms, that an artificially-generated <I>issur hefza</I> can be used to generate further such status through media like "<I>hatfasah</I>", and that <I>neder</I> comes about simply as a function of serious personal commitment increases the significance of this institution within the broader framework of the <I>halakhic </I>world-view. Man's capacity to impact upon his own (and in some cases even affect others-<I>mudar hana'ah</I>)spiritual reality and the blurring of lines between secular, neutral, and religious spheres are just a few of the implications that follow from a proper appreciation of <I>hilkhot nedarim</I>. The fact that one can occasionally apply the singular concept of <I>neder</I> to spiritual initiatives <I>(kum ve-aseh) [nidrei heqdesh</I> (see Ramban,beg. of <I>Matot</I>), perhaps <I>nidrei zedakah</I>, possibly even <I>nidrei mizvah</I> (see commentators Nedarim 8a, including R. Avraham of Montpellier, and commentaries on the verse "<I>va-yidar Yaakov neder</I>")] strongly suggests that, beyond obligation, such <I>halakhic</I> initiatives are perceived as a Jew's natural spiritual destiny to which he has a particular proclivity (see Rambam <I>hil' Gittin</I> 2:20; <I>Niddah</I> 30b). The individual obligates himself by associating with that destiny merely by invoking <I>neder</I> in these contexts!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the Torah's urgent tone and unusual formulation of "<I>zeh ha-davar</I> etc." can be understood against this background. Moreover, <I>nedarim</I> are depicted in this context as "<I>neder la-Hashem</I>" because, even more than the parallel institution of <I>shavuah</I> (<I>issur gavra),</I> the singular transformative nature of <I>nedarim</I> reflects much not only about the great importance of personal commitment and integrity, but about the role of individual initiative and the wide scope and inherently transcendent quality of <I>halakhic</I> life. [Some of these concepts are also reflected in <I>hil. shavuot</I> as well, but with a different emphasis. See also Rambam <I>hil. Shavuot</I>5:4] Violation of such commitments ("<I>Lo Yahel</I>") is viewed not merely as a breach of integrity, but as a desecration precisely because it reflects a neutral approach toward <I>halakhic </I>reality, always a matter of spirituality [<I>hillul</I>, which results from an approach of <I>hullin</I>].</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Properly conceived, the concept reflected by the institution of <I>nedarim</I>-- of a <I>halakhic</I> reality that is, in part, shaped by individual commitment--, enhances the prestige and authority of the entire <I>halakhic</I> system byaccenting its self-sufficiency and centrality. At the same time, this ambitious principle may also be easily misconstrued as undermining the objective status of existing norms and obligations. In addition, if not properly understood and seriously implemented, the abuse of <I>nedarim</I> may generate significant <I>hillul Hashem</I> given its broader significance. Hence, Moshe <I>Rabbenu</I> initially entrusted this crucial, yet subtle theme exclusively to the elite spiritual leadership.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, Rashi notes that the spiritual elite played a special role in exempting or neutralizing <I>nedarim </I>(<I>hattarat nedarim</I> by <I>yahid mumhah</I>). It should be noted that the license of a <I>hakham</I> to neutralize vows is itself quite innovative. The Mishneh in <I>Haggigah </I>10a characterizes it as "<I>porhin ba-avir ve-ein lahem al mahshe-yismokhu</I>" (hanging in the air without a clear source in the Torah). It is the system of <I>halakah</I>, by means of its oral tradition, that justifies this innovation. Furthermore, exemptions, based on <I>petah, haratah</I> etc., reflect the kind of qualitative commitment necessary to generate the status (or commitment, in case of <I>shavuah</I>) at the outset. The mechanism employed to neutralize commitment may also project the theme of
<I>halakhic</I> reality", as true intent and past commitment are reassessed in quintessentially <I>halakhic</I> terms. The scholar's discerning role entails both <I>halakhic</I> expertise and human empathy and sensitivity. It should also be noted that while the sacrificial commitments of non-Jews are binding (<I>Menahot</I> 73b), <I>hattarat nedarim</I> is apparently reserved exclusively for Jews (<I>Yerushalmi Nazir</I> 9:1), as it is represents a uniquely <I>halakhic</I> concept. It is, thus, entirely appropriate that the <I>roshei ha-matot</I> were assigned such a prominent place in the initial transmission of these laws.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several <I>pesukim</I> indicate that one should ideally avoid <I>nedarim</I> (<I>Devarim</I> 23:23, <I>Nedarim</I> 77b ;<I>Kohelet </I>5:4). <I>Hazal </I>register great ambivalence with respect to <I>nedarim</I>. Some statements unequivocally discourage <I>nedarim </I>(<I>Nedarim</I> 9a). Others strongly castigate those who involve themselves in this sphere (<I>Nedarim</I> 22a). In one context (<I>Nedarim</I> 9a), committing to action or inaction by means of a <I>neder </I>is equated with the building of a <I>bamah</I>, while implementing one's promise is tantamount to bringing a proper sacrifice. At the same time, we also encounter praise for one who intensifies, or even reinforces his commitment to perform <I>mizvot</I> by invoking <I>nedarim</I> (and often these are formulated as <I>nedarim</I>!- <I>Nedarim</I> 8a). Given the various implications inherent in the institution of <I>Nedarim</I>, one can more fully appreciate this ambivalence. Unrestricted or unqualified use of <I>nedarim</I> may lead to an abuse of the very principle that, applied judiciously, enhances the prestige of personal commitment and <I>halakhic</I> reality. Frequent use is certainly unlikely to enhance these themes. The comparison to building a <I>bamah</I> or bringing a sacrifice is particularly apt if broader religious sensibilities are reflected by one's approach to nedarim.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As noted, positive appraisal is generally reserved for one who butresses his commitment to existing obligations by means of a <I>neder</I>. Indeed, it is particularly appropriate to engage in <I>nedarim</I> in a time of religious crisis, based on the paradigm of Yaakov Avinu (Midrash Rabbah on Bereshit 28:20) While some halakhists (Ran, Nedarim 8a) believe that one incurs the additional violation of "<I>Lo Yahel</I>" if one fails to implement a <I>mizvah-neder</I> thereby increasing the stakes and motivation to comply, Ramban's view (commentary on Matot) is that no further prohibition applies. In what sense, then, has one enhanced his commitment to the <I>mizvah</I>, such that he is praised? It is possible, however, that by identifying the <I>neder</I> theme with his obligation or prohibition, the individual underscores the extent to which he perceives these obligations as real and concrete, and therefore even more compelling. Such a judicious use of <I>nedarim</I> is indeed praiseworthy.</P>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Michael Rosensweig]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[1999]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: noach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The conclusion of parshat Noah marks the transition from Noah to Avraham Avinu.  Hazal were intrigued by the relative stature of these two great religious personalities, noting that assessments of Noah's spiritual achievements range from high praise to implied criticism. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is interesting to note that the personalities of Avraham and Noah represent significant halakhic designations.  Avraham is not only the father of the Jewish nation-- <I>av hamon  goyim</I>--, but his special qualities, especially his commitment to <I>hesed</I>, constitute a spiritual-genetic legacy for his descendants.  T he Talmud (Yevamot 79a) indicates that one should suspect the lineage of any Jew who does not exhibit the basic humane qualities associated with Avraham Avinu.  Rambam codifies these sentiments in the concluding halakhot of hilkhot Matnot Aniyim (10:1-2).  Although the source for the non-Jewish obligations demanded by the Torah is to be found in connection with Adam ha-rishon's sojourn in Gan Eden (Bereshit 2:16; Sanhedrin 56b), these obligations are identified with the personality of Noah, referred to as the Noahide laws, their adherents earning the appellation of ben-Noah. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undoubtedly, a closer look at the personalities and contributions of Avraham and Noah will illuminate the different agendas and legacies of Noahide and Jewish law.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hazal speculate whether Noah's spiritual attainments would not have been even more impressive had he lived in Avraham's generation.  It is important, however, to note that even those who argue that Noah would have benefited from that more conducive environment appear to be suggesting that he would have been positively affected by that exposure, but do not project that Noah's influence in shaping the destiny of those around him would have been enhanced.   The contrast to Avraham's pivotal role is stark.  Avraham is credited as the father of monotheism, having single-handedly rediscovered the Divine presence.  Moreover, he initiated and sustained the quest for spirituality, motivating others to  join his mission, literally transforming  their lives.  Hazal note that the Torah speaks of the souls that Avraham created- "<I>ve-et ha-nefesh asher asu be-haran</I>" (Bereshit 12:5).  His willingness to undertake the most painful and personal sacrifices --reflected in two formulations of  "<I>lekh lekhah</I>" (Bereshit 12:1; 22:2) --to sever his link to the past embodied by his father's home, and to abandon his long-anticipated future in the episode of akedat Yitzhak -- reflect this absolute commitment to Hashem.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Noah's commitment is characterized as <I>"<U>et</U> ha-Elokim hithalekh Noah</I>"(Bereshit 7:1), while Avraham's  is described as "<I>asher hithalakhti <U>lefanav</I></U>".  According to the midrash, cited by Rashi (7:7), Noah required some impetus to enter into the tevah, the symbol of his spiritual journey, while Avraham was always self-motivated.  Noah's legacy focuses on his own status and survival-"<I>eleh toledot Noah, Noah</I>" etc., while Avraham's active role in shaping the values and destiny of his progeny - "<I>eleh toledot Yitzhak ben Avraham, Avraham <U>holid</U> et Yitzhak</I>" - are accented.   Avraham's passionate plea on behalf of Sedom, one particular society whose values stood in total contradiction to his own world-view, is often sharply contrasted with Noah's silent reaction  to the doomed fate of an entire world.  While Noah hedged his bets and is sometimes characterized as "<I>mekatnei emunah</I>", Avraham's approach is characterized by simple faith (Bereshit 15:6), idealism and enthusiasm.  "<I>Vayashkem Avraham ba-boker</I>" (Bereshit 22:3) signifies <I>zerizut</I> (alacrity) in approaching the <I>akedah</I>, notwithstanding the fact that it was undoubtedly his most difficult spiritual and emotional challenge.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Noah is essentially a crisis manager and survivor, albeit one entrusted with the crucial role of ensuring continuity.  The only way he can respond to the crisis of "<I>ketz kol basar ba lefanai</I>" is by insulating himself in the tevah and riding out the storm.  Avraham Avinu, on the other hand, is an idealistic visionary, passionately devoted to tranforming the world into an arena for Hashem's <I>kedushah</I> - accenting "<I>elokei ha-aretz</I>", fully committed to spreading the spritually ambitious teachings of the Torah.  He employs the values of <I>hesed</I> in arguing on behalf of Sedom, and in implementing his rescue of  Lot, though he had chosen the lifestyle antithetical to that of Avraham's- "<I>vehu yoshev be-Sedom</I>"(Bereshit 14:12).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Noah's limited spiritual ambition and more circumscribed role is reflected by his conduct in the aftermath of the crisis when he was faced with the opportunity to initiate and shape the new world.  In many respects, he is unable to transcend the limitations of his environment and his past.  Instead of seizing a singular opportunity to symbolically and substantively inaugarate a new order, he proceeds, after bringing a <I>korban</I> of thanksgiving, to plant a vineyard and succumb to its effects, with disastrous consequences.  The contrast to Avraham Avinu, the maximalist man of destiny who never rests on his laurals, achieving new spiritual heights as he is constantly  challenged and tested - "<I>va-yehi ahar ha-devarim ha-elah</I>" (Bereshit 22:1, 20 ; Avot  5:3)-, is manifest.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These two perspectives are reflected in the contrast between the full complement of halakhic obligation and the Noahide code.  The 613 commandments relate to and regulate every dimension of human life, expanding the concept and scope of the sacred and suffusing the mundane with sancitiy.   The more limited seven-obligation Noahide code does effectively insure significant social stability,  a standard of monotheism, as well as a measure of sanctity in other realms of life, but it does not approximate the pervasive and ambitious  program of the halakhah.  The midrash (Mishpatim Rabbah, nos. 6, 18 ) contrasts  the two systems in various ways, and emphasizes that the greater scope of halakhic obligation impacts upon the quality and significance of even those aspects which the two systems share in common.  While Noah's role as a survivor who bridged two worlds was indispensable, it is the transition to Avraham Avinu, the embodiment of spiritual initiative  and idealism, that marks the true beginning of Jewish history.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[Parshat Chayei Sara - Jewish Burial]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Hershel Shachter]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[1999]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: chayey]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The Torah tells us that when our mother, Sara, died Avraham refused to bury her in the general municipal cemetery. He insisted on designating a separate location as <I>kever yisroel</I>. Why have the Jews insisted throughout the ages on maintaining a separate cemetery?</P>

<P>The <I>halachah</I> divides all religious articles used to fulfill <I>mitzvot</I> into two categories: <I>tefillin</I>, <I>mezuzah</I>, and <I>sifrei Torah</I>, are labeled as "<I>tashmishei kedushah</I>"; as opposed to <I>lulav</I>, a <I>shofar</I>, an <I>etrog</I>, and <I>schach</I> of a <I>sukkah</I>, which are labeled as, "<I>tashmishei mitzvah</I>". The practical difference between the two categories is the following: an old pair of <I>tefillin</I>, or an old <I>sefer Torah</I> or <I>mezuzah</I>, which can no longer serve as the object of a <I>mitzvah</I>, may not be discarded but must be placed in the <I>sheimot</I> and buried in a dignified fashion. An old <I>lulav</I> or <I>shofar</I> which one no longer plans to use for <I>mitzvah</I> purposes loses its status as "<I>huktzah limitzvato"</I> and need not be placed in the <I>sheimos</I> and may be discarded. The sanctity which descends upon "<I>tashmishei mitzvah</I>" which is derived from the fact that "<I>chal shem shamayim al hasukkah</I>" (Beitzah 30b) is only temporary in nature, and vanishes into thin air as soon as the object is no longer set aside for use in the performance of a mitzvah. </P>

<P>How did the Ravs know how to determine which religious articles belonged to which category? R. Chaim of Volozhin explains in his work, "Nefesh Hachayim", that the source of all permanent <I>kedushah</I> is the Torah. <I>tefillin, mezuzah</I> and <I>sefer Torah</I>, which all contain passages from the Torah are considered as <I>tashmishei kedushah</I>. Even the <I>bayit</I> of the <I>shel rosh</I> which only has the letter <I>shin</I> on it, also qualifies as <I>tashmishei kedushah. </I>One word , even one letter of Torah has the significance of Torah. The <I>sukkah</I>, the <I>etrog</I>, and the <I>tzitzit</I>, however have no Torah confined within them, and therefore can not qualify as <I>tashmishei kedushah</I>.</P>

<P>The human body is always involved in the performance of <I>mitzvot</I> while one is alive. The fact that all men have the <I>tzelem elokim </I>would certainly more than sufficient to require that we respect each other. But after one dies, and the <I>tzelem elokim</I> is no longer there, and the body is no longer performing <I>mitzvot</I> there should no longer be any requirement to respect the dead body. Here the <I>halachah</I> of <I>tashmishei kedushah</I> becomes relevant. The Jewish body, which was involved with Torah acquires the status of <I>tashmishei kedushah</I> and may not simply be discarded after death. And even those Jews who never learned a word, or even a letter of Torah during their lifetime, according to the talmudic tradition (Niddah 30b) had already been involved in Torah study before they were born. Hence, the Jewish dead must be buried with dignity, in a separate Jewish cemetery. </P>

<P>If one placed an old <I>lulav</I> or an old <I>shofar</I> into the <I>sheimos</I> this would be disrespectful to the <I>tashmishei kedushah</I> which are found there. It is the study of Torah which endows the Jew with the <I>kedushat yisroel</I>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one eats a meal on Chanukah, <I>minhag</I> has it that 
<I>ve-al ha-nissim</I> is included in  the<I> Birkat Ha-mazon, </I>though the 
Talmud clarifies that this is not a <I>halachah. </I>Because it is  <I>minhag</I> 
if one forgets to recite <I>ve-al ha-nissim</I> one  is neither required nor 
permitted to repeat the <I>Birkat Ha-mazon. </I>The Rema comments that in such 
a case, the <I>minhag</I> dictates that one add on among the various <I>Harachaman</I> prayers, 
"<I>Harachaman yaaseh lanu nissim veniflaot keshem sheasita la-avoteinu bayamim hahem 
bazman hazeh," </I>and then continue to recite "<I>Beyemei Matityahu..</I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commentaries on the <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> raise a question: 
how is it permissible to ask for a miracle to occur? Doesn't the <I>Mishna in Berachot</I> state
 that if a pregnant woman is already past the first forty days of her pregnancy, and 
 the sex of the baby has already been determined, that one may not pray for a miracle 
 and ask for a baby of a specific gender? </P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <I>Shaarei Teshuvah</I> quotes the three exceptions to the 
rule as stated by the <I>Acharonim</I>, as to when one <U>is</U> permitted to ask 
for a <I>nes</I>: 1) One may ask for a <I>nes nistar</I>. For this is what <I>hashgacha</I> 
is all about- God controls the world from behind the scenes, without openly violating 
any of the rules of nature. 2)Since we believe that, "<I>ein mazal le-yisrael,</I>" that 
the Jewish people are, "<I>lemala min hateva</I>," there is nothing at all improper 
about requesting a <I>nes nigleh</I> on their behalf. 3) Even if the <I>nes</I> is 
not for <I>Klal Yisrael</I>, but only on behalf of an unusual <I>tzadik, </I>this 
too is allowed, as is evidenced from the various stories related in the <I>Gemara 
Taanit</I> regarding several <I>tzadikim</I> who prayed for miracles. The great 
<I>tzadik</I> is also <I>"lemala min hateva."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </I>  <I>  </I>&#9;In <I>Parshat Korach</I> we find Moshe Rabbeinu 
requesting of God that even if the opening of <I>Gehenom</I> not be here, that He make
 a <I>nes</I> and <I>"yivra Hashem</I>" - let it move to here. Because the miracle
  was needed- either for <I>klal yisrael</I> or the unusual tzadik- Moshe was allowed to pray for it. </P>
  
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A similar situation appears in the <I>Haftorah</I>. Shmuel Ha-navi calls 
upon God to bring about a miracle on Shmuel's personal behalf, to indicate his righteousness. 
This appears to be the thematic similarity between the <I>sedra </I>and 
the<I> Haftorah</I>: the <U>exceptions</U> to the rule i.e. when one <U>is</U> permitted to pray 
for a miracle. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To illustrate this point, I remember many years ago, when I 
visited the Ponovez Yeshina in Benai Brak, the <I>tzibbur</I> was reciting <I>tehillim</I> on 
behalf of a cancer patient on whom the doctors had given up hope. The <I>Mashgiach</I>,
 Rav Yecheskel Levenstein<I> -</I> refused to participate in the prayers because in effect they were praying for a miracle.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Traditionally, we have believed that the darkest period of the <I>galut</I> (exile) will occur immediately prior to the coming of the Messiah.  In those final years before redemption, morality and even simple decency will be hard to find.  Authentic spirituality will disappear, and the world will be rife with heresy.  As the Talmud states:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;R. Nehorai said: In the generation when the Messiah comes, young men will insult the old, and old men will stand before the young; daughters will rise up against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law.  The people shall be dog-faced, and a son will not be abashed in his father's presence.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;R. Nechemiah said: In the generation when the Messiah comes, impudence will increase, none shall esteem another...and the government of Israel will be converted to heresy.  This supports R. Yitzchak, who said: The Messiah will not come until the government of Israel is converted to the belief of the heretics. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Rabbah said: What verse proves this?  "<I>It is all turned white; he is clean</I>."&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;(Sanhedrin 97)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;This doctrine is hard to understand for two reasons.  Why would Rabbah choose the symbolism of "whiteness" to represent the darkest period of the <I>galut</I>?  And why does the Talmud claim that the spread of heresy will usher in the coming of the Messiah?  Would it not make more sense, though, to assume that in the years immediately before the Messiah's arrival we will witness an increase in religious observance?  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;To answer the first question, let us refer to Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik's explanation of the symbolism of white and blue.  (See <U>Reflections of the Rav</U> vol. II, ch. 2 for an expanded discussion of this symbolism.)  White denotes clarity and lucidity, that which is rational and logical.  In modern Hebrew and in talmudic Aramaic, "<I>chavar</I>" (literally translated as "white") means "clear" or "proven."  Blue, however, represents mystery and ambiguity, the esoteric or even mystical truths which cannot be proven scientifically.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;A spiritually healthy person must be able to incorporate both white and blue into his or her personality.  White, the ability to think clearly and rationally, is a gift from God, and can be used as a tool for divine service.  But excessive faith in the proven and the rational can lead people to reject God, who conceals Himself in mystery and refuses, for the most part, to allow us direct apprehension of His being.  When a person accepts as true only that which he can measure and prove--when he becomes totally "white"--he opens himself to arrogance and ultimately to heresy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;When the Messiah's salvation is most needed God will send him to redeem the world.   It is precisely in that generation that his salvation, viewed against his generation's prevalent heresy, will be most clearly highlighted and meaningful.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Aside from an important insight into the nature of the messianic process, Rav Yitzchak, more globally, teaches us that holiness is best appreciated when viewed in contrast with non-holiness. And as is the case with the ultimate redemption, distinguishing holiness from the profane may be necessary to fully appreciate holiness.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;This explains a fundamental halachah regarding the donation of <I>terumah</I> and <I>challah</I>.  The Mishnah  (Challah 1:9 and Terumot 4:5) states that one cannot dedicate his entire batch of dough as <I>challah</I>, nor can he dedicate his entire harvest to be <I>terumah</I>.  The Talmud (Chullin 136a) provides a biblical source for this rule: the Torah calls <I>challah</I> and <I>terumah</I> "<I>reishit</I>" or "the first portion" of the dough and harvest.  As such, the donation must remain a portion of a greater whole; it may not encompass the entire thing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;But <I>challah</I> and <I>terumah</I> are not the only priestly gifts declared as "<I>reishit.</I>"  The Torah also commands us to give the <I>Kohen</I> the first of our yearly wool sheerings - <I>Reishit HaGez</I>.  Yet there is no parallel law stating that we must donate only a portion of our wool to the <I>Kohen</I>.  Why may we dedicate all of our wool as a priestly gift but not all of our dough and grain?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The <I>Melechet Shlomo</I> (Challah 1:9) quotes the following answer.  The only time the term <I>reishit</I> indicates that only a portion of the whole may be donated is when the gift itself is inherently holy.  <I>Challah</I> and <I>terumah</I> are two such cases.  Both may only be consumed by a ritually pure Kohen, both have strict laws regarding their handling and donation and both prescribe severe punishments for those who desecrate their sanctity.  In these cases, the Torah demands that we distinguish the donation and highlight its <I>kedushah</I> by leaving over a portion of dough or grain to remain plain and ordinary. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Wool of the <I>Reishis HaGez</I> contains no <I>kedushah</I>, as shown by the lack of strict rules regarding its handling and consumption.  Since it has no <I>kedushah</I> to highlight, there is no need to distinguish it by contrasting it with remaining wool.  The entire batch of wool may therefore be donated.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Our Ravs' insight into the messianic era and the detailed laws of <I>challah</I> and <I>terumah</I> are two sources that not only emphasize the importance of distinguishing between the holy and non-holy, but also demonstrate that the distinction itself may grant us a fuller understanding and appreciation of true holiness.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+1 FACE="Arial">


<P>In this week's Torah-portions we learn that the Jews constructed the <I>Mishkan</I> and prepared the <I>bigdei kehunah</I>.  Although in both cases the Jews followed the directions they had been given, the Torah stresses at every stage in the preparation of the <I>bigdei kehunah</I> that the work was done "<I>ka'asher tzivah Hashem et Moshe</I>" -- "just as Hashem commanded Moshe" (see Ramban 37:8, 38:22).  Why would the Torah stress the fact that the Jews obeyed their orders only regarding the <I>bigdei kehunah</I>?   Why not include the phrase by the construction of the <I>Mishkan</I> as well?</P>
<P>To answer this question R. Velvel Soloveichick explained that the verb "<I>tzivah</I>" is a halachic term; whenever it appears in the Torah it denotes the presence of a <I>mitzvah</I> <I>le-dorot</I> (an obligation that is binding throughout the generations), as opposed to a <I>hora'at sha'ah</I> (an obligation that was binding only for a limited time).  This distinction between perpetual <I>mitzvot</I> and temporary obligations was noted by <I>tana'im</I> in the <I>Sifra</I> and was quoted by Rashi (Vayikra 6:1); the Rambam also adopted this as a criterion for inclusion in his <I>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</I> (<I>Shoresh</I> 3).  For this reason the Torah only used the phrase "<I>ka'asher <U>tzivah</U> Hashem et Moshe</I>"<I> </I>regarding the <I>bigdei kehunah</I>, whose specifications would never change.  It would be inappropriate for the Torah to use the term "<I>tzivah</I>" when referring to the details of the <I>Mishkan</I>, whose boards and curtains would later be superseded by the stones of the <I>Beit ha-Mikdash</I>.</P>

<P>The distinction between <I>mitzvot le-dorot</I> and <I>hora'ot sha'ah</I> should not be limited to the realm of biblical exegesis.  It is relevant today as well, particularly in the area of "<I>ma'aseh Rav</I>" (attempting to determine current policy based on the practices and recorded opinions of our Rabbeim).  Developing a <I>p'sak</I> requires careful analysis of a given case's details, so that the recorded <I>p'sak</I> of a <I>Rav</I> may not be applicable to other cases in which the details are different.  Sometimes even the actions of a <I>Rav</I> must be considered <I>hora'ot sha'ah</I>, and therefore inapplicable to the world today.</P>
<P>The great care that must be exercised when drawing conclusions from the actions of a  <I>Rav</I> is stressed by the Talmud itself.  The Talmud (Chullin 6b) relates that when Rebbi heard that R. Meir ate fruit grown in the town of Beit She'an without taking <I>t'rumot u-ma'asrot</I>, Rebbi followed this "<I>ma'aseh Rav</I>" and ruled that Beit She'an should not  be considered part of the Land of Israel (produce grown outside Israel does not require tithing).  But he only lent such weight to R. Meir's reported actions because they were attested to by R. Yehoshua ben Zeruz, a torah scholar in his own right, and brother-in-law of R. Meir.  Rebbi was sure that R. Yehoshua ben Zeruz  would have understood properly what he had seen R. Meir practice, and so he relied on R. Yehoshua's reports in determining the <I>halachah</I>.  If R. Meir's actions had been reported by a person of lesser stature, Rebbi would have had to be concerned that important details of the situation had been overlooked, or that R. Meir's actions could only be considered a <I>hora'at sha'ah</I>.</P>

<P>The distinction between <I>mitzvot le-dorot</I> and <I>hora'ot sha'ah</I> is not the only one recognized by <I>halachah</I>; we must also distinguish between <I>mitzvot</I> possessing different levels of holiness.  When a<I> yom tov</I> falls on a Sunday, for example, we recite the blessing "<I>ha-mavdil bein kodesh le-kodesh</I>," to distinguish between the higher holiness of <I>Shabbat</I> and the lower holiness of the arriving <I>yom tov</I>.  </P>
<P>In fact, there is a hierarchy of importance which encompasses all the <I>mitzvot</I> and distinguishes between different levels of holiness among them.  Just as we must know which <I>mitzvot</I> were given <I>le-dorot</I> and which were only intended <I>le-sha'ah</I>, so too we must know today which <I>mitzvot</I> have priority over others, which are the rule and which are the exceptions to the rule.  </P>
<P>It is clear that words and ideas take on new meanings when set forth in different arrangements.  The philosopher Blaise Pascal, for example, wrote that although each of his individual ideas may have appeared in the writings of earlier philosophers, the arrangement in which he presented them created his unique philosophy (<I>Thoughts 1:22</I>).  Similarly, although all poets use words from the dictionary, no one would argue that therefore all poems mean the same thing.  The same is true of <I>mitzvot</I>: to interfere with the hierarchy of <I>mitzvot</I> is to change the <I>mitzvot</I> themselves, and to depart from the established values of Judaism.</P>

<P>In this week's Torah-portions we learn that the Jews constructed the <I>Mishkan</I> and prepared the <I>bigdei kehunah</I>.  Although in both cases the Jews followed the directions they had been given, the Torah stresses at every stage in the preparation of the <I>bigdei kehunah</I> that the work was done "<I>ka'asher tzivah Hashem et Moshe</I>" -- "just as Hashem commanded Moshe" (see Ramban 37:8, 38:22).  Why would the Torah stress the fact that the Jews obeyed their orders only regarding the <I>bigdei kehunah</I>?   Why not include the phrase by the construction of the <I>Mishkan</I> as well?</P>
<P>To answer this question R. Velvel Soloveichick explained that the verb "<I>tzivah</I>" is a halachic term; whenever it appears in the Torah it denotes the presence of a <I>mitzvah</I> <I>le-dorot</I> (an obligation that is binding throughout the generations), as opposed to a <I>hora'at sha'ah</I> (an obligation that was binding only for a limited time).  This distinction between perpetual <I>mitzvot</I> and temporary obligations was noted by <I>tana'im</I> in the <I>Sifra</I> and was quoted by Rashi (Vayikra 6:1); the Rambam also adopted this as a criterion for inclusion in his <I>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</I> (<I>Shoresh</I> 3).

<P>The <I>medrash</I> points out that the <I>bracha</I>  which Avraham granted his son Yitzchak revolved around the verb, "<I>natan"</I> ("<I>Vayiten Avraham et kol asher lo leYitzchak</I>"). Therefore, years later when Yitzchak formulated his <I>bracha</I> for his son Yaakov, he opened with the words, "<I>Vayiten lecha Elokim</I>." And because Yitzchak's <I>bracha </I> ended with the use of the verb "<I>karah</I>" ("<I>Vayikra Yitzchak el Yaakov</I>"), years later, when Yaakov was formulating his <I>bracha</I> for his children, he started with the same expression, "<I>Vayikra Yaakov el banav.</I>" Yaakov concluded his <I>brachot</I> with the expression "<I>vezot asher diber lahem avihem.</I>" Therefore, many years later when Moshe Rabbeinu formulated his <I>brachot</I> to <I>Klal Yisrael</I> he too used the same expression, and started with the phrase, "<I>Vezot habrcha.</I>" And again, because Moshe concluded his <I>brachot</I> with the expression, "<I>ashrecha yisroel,</I>" years later, when King David composed the <I>Sefer Tehillim</I>, he began with the same expression, "<I>Ashrei haish</I>." </P>
<P>The <I>medrash</I> learns from the <I>pasuk</I>, "<I>mezekeinim etbonan</I>" (<I>Tehillim 119</I>), that each generation learns from and emulates the practices of the earlier generation. The Ravs of the <I>medrash</I> understood quite well that it would be unreasonable to expect all the generations to always use the exact same expressions. Times change, attitudes change, and expressions of speech change. The Ravs just felt that the practices of each generation should be connected with those of the earlier generations. </P>
<P>If the Ravs felt this way with respect to formulating <I>brachot</I> certainly they would feel more so with respect to <I>halachot</I> of how to keep the <I>mitzvot</I>. True, the Torah scholars of each generation - if they are qualified- may express an opposing view to those of earlier generations. We see many times in the <I>Mishnayot</I> that  a later <I>Beit Din</I> overturned the <I>psak</I> of an earlier <I>Beit Din</I>. But there still must be a "<I>hemshech</I>" and a connection to the Torah views of the earlier generations. To use the terminology of the Rav, "<I>chiddush</I>" (new insight) is acceptable, but "<I>shinui</I>" (change) is not; and one must have a very strong <I>mesorah</I> to know how to distinguish between the two. <I>Mattan Torah</I> did not occur yesterday. Our Torah of today is only valid to the extent that it has been transmitted accurately, by the <I>masorah,</I> from earlier generations. That <I>masorah</I> is one consisting of a way of thinking <I><U>halachically</I></U>, as well as attitudes, perspectives, and style, vis-&agRave;-vis the wording of <I>brachot</I>. </P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1 FACE="Arial">

<P>&#9;As the second half of <I>sefer Shemot </I>focuses primarily on the 
construction of the <I>Mishkan, </I>the tragic <I>eigel </I>tale sticks out, 
seemingly unrelated to its neighboring <I>perakim.  </I>Rashi, however 
(<I>Shemos </I>31:18), sees a response to the <I>chet ha-eigel </I>in the 
Tabernacle construction, explaining that the <I>Mishkan </I>helped Israel 
to achieve a <I>kappara </I>for their sin.  Interestingly, in <I>Bamidbar </I>
(19:2) Rashi understands the <I>mitzva </I>of the <I>Para Aduma </I>as 
fulfilling a similar function.  How did these two, apparently different,
 <I>mitzvot </I>serve as a <I>kappara </I>for the same <I>chet</I>?</P>
 
<P>&#9;If we are to understand how a <I>mitzva </I>can serve as a <I>kappara,
 </I>we must comprehend the sin for which it atones.  What was Israel’s 
 motivation in creating the golden calf?  In his <I>Kuzari, </I>Rav Yehuda 
 haLevi explains that the <I>benei Yisrael</I> had no initial intent to worship 
 <I>avoda zara.  </I>Rather, they sought a this-worldly manifestation of God’s 
 presence.  This desire, not intrinsically wrong, was satisfied by the <I>binyan 
 haMishkan.  </I>What differentiated the <I>eigel </I>from the <I>Mishkan?</P>

<P>&#9;</I>The answer can be found in the last several <I>pesukim </I>of <I>
sefer Shemot.  </I>Concerning every act involved in the <I>binyan haMishkan, 
</I>the Torah takes pains to assure us that it was performed &quot;<I>ka-asher 
tziva Hasehm es Moshe.</I>&quot;  The emphasis of this recurring phrase contains 
the simple yet fundamental difference between the <I>eigel </I>and the 
<I>Mishkan.  </I>Both were intended to serve as vehicles with which to relate 
to the Divine, yet one became <I>avoda zara </I>and the other became the 
dwelling place of the <I>Shekhina.  </I>The <I>Mishkan </I>was built because 
Hashem had commanded it; each detail was adhered to precisely as God had 
instructed.  Only in such a manner can a physical entity serve as a <I>makom 
</I>for the <I>hashra’as haShekhina.  </I>A plan devised by man without the 
Almighty’s specific instruction will ultimately result in <I>Avoda Zara.  
</I>The lesson to be learned after the <I>eigel </I>incident was that the God’s
 presence would rest in Israel only if His specific commanded methods of 
 attaining this goal were adhered to.  As such, the <I>Mishkan </I>was the 
 ultimate <I>kappara </I>for the <I>chet ha-eigel.  Klal Yisrael </I>would
  ultimately merit an earthly manifestation of Hashem’s glory, but only 
  &quot;<I>ka-asher tziva Hashem es Moshe.</I>&quot;</P>

<P>&#9;With this understanding of the root of the <I>chet ha-eigel, 
</I>the <I>para aduma’s </I>role in the <I>kappara </I>is equally apparent.  
The red heifer could be called the &quot;<I>chok </I>par excellence.&quot; 
 As a <I>chok, </I>it reinforces to us the message that our <I>avodat Hashem </I>
 must be dictated by God.  We cannot rationalize the meaning of a <I>chok, 
 </I>yet we perform it nonetheless.  This is the antithesis of the mistake that 
 led to the <I>eigel</i>.  Rather than relying on our human perception of what 
 is spiritually appropriate, we subjugate ourselves totally to the <I>retzon 
 Hashem, </I>and only in this manner will we attain <I>hashra’as haShekhina. 
 </I>Furthermore, the <I>para aduma </I>serves not merely as an atonement for 
 the <I>eigel</i>, but as a prerequisite for entering the <I>Mishkan.  </I>Only 
 when these <I>mitzvos </I>work in tandem- when we learn from both that
  <I>avodas Hashem </I>is dictated by &quot;<I>ka-asher tziva Hasehm es 
  Moshe</I>&quot;-<I> </I>can the <I>chet ha-eigel</I> be eradicated.  </P>

<P>&#9;The concept of the <I>Mishkan </I>being the ultimate expression of 
&quot;<I>ka-asher tziva Hashem es Moshe&quot; </I>was endangered by Nadav and 
Avihu offering <I>ketores  </I>&quot;<I>asher lo tziva osam,</I>&quot; which 
they were not commanded to offer.  A dedication of the <I>Mishkan </I>which 
did not follow God’s precise instructions would undermine its entire message. 
 Such actions were therefore punished severely.  </P>

<P>&#9;May we be <I>zoche </I>to learn the message of the <I>Mishkan </I>and
 the <I>para aduma, </I>and may we live our lives &quot;<I>ka-asher tziva
  Hashem es Moshe.</I>&quot;</P>

<P>        Throughout the prayer service on Yom Kippur we focus on <I>teshuvah</I> (repentance) and <I>taharah</I> (purity).  We confess our sins and renew our commitment to Torah and <I>mitzvot</I>.  But the Yom Kippur service in the <I>Beit ha-Mikdash</I>, as recounted in this week's Torah-portion, seems quite different.  The Torah describes an elaborate sacrificial service, culminating with the <I>sh'nei ha-se'irim</I> (the two goats, one designated as the <I>sa'ir la-Hashem</I> and sacrificed to God, and the other, the <I>sa'ir la'azazel</I>, invested with the sins of the nation and killed), which does not appear to have anything to do with the <I>teshuvah</I> process. How did this sacrificial service enable us to accomplish the goal of Yom Kippur, of "purifying ourselves before God"?</P>
<P>        To understand the Yom Kippur service in the <I>Beit ha-Mikdash</I>, let us analyze the events that preceded and culminated in the first Yom Kippur, when the Jews wandered in the desert after leaving Egypt.  Eighty days before the first Yom Kippur, the Jews assembled at the foot of Sinai to receive the Torah.  The Talmud (Shabbat 88a) states that God lifted Mount Sinai above the Jewish people and warned them that if they accepted the Torah everything would be good for them, but if they did not accept the Torah they would be buried under the mountain. It was made clear to the Jews that their personal lives and their existence as a nation were entirely dependent upon accepting the Torah.</P>
<P>        Although the Jews were given this warning before they received the Torah, they did not understand its true lesson until forty days later, after having committed the <I>chet ha-eigel</I> (the sin of the Golden Calf). God told Moshe that the Jews had demonstrated that they were unwilling to live up to their original commitment to accept the Torah, and so the entire nation would be destroyed.  It thus became clear that the original warning still applied, and that the original consequence of not accepting the Torah could still be fulfilled.  "<I>Sham tehei kevuratchem</I>," Hashem told Moshe; the entire nation would perish at Sinai.</P>
<P>        Moshe Rabbeinu interceded on behalf of the Jews, and God decided to give them a second chance.  God decreed that a second covenant would be made, and a second set of the <I>luchot</I> (Ten Commandments) would be given. The day for this renewal would be Yom Kippur.  The Jews understood, as they reaccepted the Torah on the first Yom Kippur, that henceforth they would always live in the shadow of Sinai, and that life as a Jew cannot exist without Torah.</P>
<P>        The two goats which were brought into the <I>Beit Ha-Mikdash</I> every Yom Kippur would remind the watching Jews of the first Yom Kippur and of its message, that life without Torah is death.  The goats were physically identical, as the <I>halachah</I> requires (Yoma 62a), yet each would embark on a path radically different from that of its partner.  One would be sacrificed to God in the holiness of the <I>Beit ha-Mikdash</I>, while the other would, symbolically, bear the sins of the entire Jewish nation.  The one sacrificed to God would have its blood brought into the Holy of Holies, while the other would meet its end on the barren desert stones.  The watching people would remember that, by accepting Torah and <I>mitzvot</I>, each Jew can become a <I>sa'ir la-Hashem</I>, devoted to holiness.  But it would also be clear that without Torah and <I>mitzvot</I>, we will become weighted down with sins, and will be represented by the <I>sa'ir la'azazel</I>.  Our lives would be empty, and meaningless as death.</P>
<P>        These lessons would be made doubly clear to the <I>Kohein Gadol</I>, as he represented the Jewish nation on Yom Kippur.  He would stand before the <I>aron</I> in the Holy of Holies, and would offer the <I>ketoret</I> (incense).  Only when its smoke formed a cloud could he proceed with the service.  Why? Because while the cloud of incense would form, and God's holiness would begin to manifest in it, the <I>Kohein Gadol</I> would remember the first Yom Kippur, when God also "descended in a cloud" ("<I>va-yeired Hashem be-anan</I>,, Shemot 34:5).  The <I>Kohein Gadol</I> would  stand in front of the <I>aron</I> knowing that there are only two things within it: the broken pieces of the first set of <I>luchot</I> and the whole second set, resting side by side. The broken set would evoke the memory of the failed first <I>kabalat ha-Torah</I>, of the Golden Calf, and the near-destruction of the Jewish nation.  The second set, still whole, represents the second, unconditional acceptance of the Torah, the source of life.  The goal of the sacrificial service of Yom Kippur is to impress us with our sometimes tragic history, to inspire us to choose the path of life, and to remind us that sin can only result in death.</P>
<P>        Today, this goal has been encapsulated in the <I>ne'ilah</I> services, whose themes are the seriousness of Yom Kippur and the consequences of our choices.  We remind ourselves that Hashem wants our <I>teshuvah</I>, not our death.  We pray that we be inscribed in the book of life, and that we attain true repentance.</P>
<P>        The <I>ba'alei mussar</I> tell us that when we read <I>parshat Acharei Mot</I> during the year, we should try to remember how we feel when we read it on Yom Kippur. Let us try to rededicate ourselves to the message of the <I>luchot</I>, and to the ideal represented by the <I>sa'ir la-Hashem</I>, so that we can all merit true life.</P>

<P>	The fascinating conversation between Bilaam and his donkey occurs after the donkey sees
an angel that Bilaam can not. Angry at his donkey for not continuing on his way, Bilaam strikes his
donkey. God grants the donkey the ability to speak and it immediately criticizes Bilaam for striking
it three times. </P>

<P>	When saying that Bilaam hit the donkey three times, the Torah uses the phrase "<EM>shalosh
regalim</EM>" rather than the more popular phrase, "<EM>shalosh peamim</EM>". Rashi comments that there was
a hidden message to Bilaam in the words of the donkey: How can you attempt to curse a nation that
will celebrate the <EM>shalosh regalim (Passover, Shavuot, </EM>and<EM> Succot)</EM>, that 
will visit the <EM>Beit Ha-Mikdash</EM> three times a year? Is this merely a play on words or is there a deeper message to be found
in this interpretation of the donkey's rebuke?</P>

<P>	Bilaam is described throughout the <EM>parshah</EM> as one who has the ability "to see". He boasts
of his visions of prophecy and prides himself in his ability to see what others cannot. Yet, while he
is able to witness exalted visions, he fails to understand that being able to glimpse the Divine is
accompanied by an awesome responsibility. One who sees the Glory of God must live up to being
carefully scrutinized by Him as well. Although Bilaam reached a high level of prophecy, his conduct
in his personal life was abominable. Chazal teach us that Bilaam was involved in horrible acts of
immorality and did not perceive his lifestyle to be contradictory to his unique status as a prophet.</P>

<P>	The Jewish people were chosen to have a unique relationship with God. This closeness
between God and His people peaked three times a year when each Jew visited the  <EM>Beit Ha-Mikdash</EM>
on the <EM>shalosh regalim</EM>. The <EM>mitzvah</EM> of visiting the <EM>Beit Ha-Mikdash</EM> is described by the Torah as
"<EM>reiyah ba-azarah", </EM>appearing in the courtyard of the <EM>Beit Ha-Mikdash</EM>. The word "<EM>yeiraeh</EM>" which
means to be seen is spelled the same as the word "<EM>yireh</EM>" which means to see. Based on the
etymology of this word Chazal teach us that there are two parts of the <EM>mitzvah</EM> of coming to the <EM>Beit
Ha-Mikdash</EM>. Each Jew comes to see God as well as to be seen by Him. One sees God by viewing
the miracles that occurred in the <EM>Beit Ha-Mikdash</EM> which demonstrated His  presence in the midst
of the Jewish people. Upon coming to the <EM>Beit Ha-Mikdash</EM> and witnessing the Divine Presence a
person's life must become transformed. He is being seen by God and must act accordingly.</P>

<P>	The dual experiences that take place when a Jew visits the <EM>Beit Ha-Mikdash</EM> on the <EM>shalosh
regalim</EM> are the antithesis of Bilaam's life experience. Bilaam had the ability to see what others could
not, yet he refused to live a life worthy of being seen by God. One who doesn't achieve the standards
set for one who "sees" ultimately loses that special gift. Bilaam was unable to see the angel that a
donkey could. It is the donkey who rebukes Bilaam: How can you Bilaam dare to try to curse a
nation that understands the secret of being seen by God?</P>

<P>	May we soon be able to visit God in His <EM>Beit Ha-Mikdash</EM>, see His Presence, and elevate our
lives so that we are worthy of being seen by Him.</P>

<P>The creation of the world is introduced to us in two different ways: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of the days of creation is prefaced by the phrase, "<I>vayomer Elokim,</I>" and the entire account begins with, "<I>Bereishit bara Elokim"</I> ; the <I>shem Hashem</I> is not used. However, when the Torah repeats the story, the <I>shem Hashem</I> is used, as it says, "<I>Hashem Elokim"</I> (2:4-21). Rashi (1:1) explains that originally the world was to be created through <I>middat hadin</I> - the strict attribute Divine Justice, as the name <I>Elokim</I> implies. However, the world could not function on such terms and was eventually created  according to the rules of justice and mercy combined. This partnership of <I>middat hadin</I> and <I>middat harachamim</I> is alluded to in the description of <I>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</I> as, <I>"Hashem Elokim</I>". <I>Elokim </I> refers to <I>din,</I> and <I>Hashem</I> to <I>rachamim</I>.</P>
<I>
</I><P>The culmination of creation also occurred in two stages: </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chazal</I> teach us that the entire creation of the world was dependant upon whether the Jewish people would accept the Torah.  The first <I>kabbalat hatorah</I> occurred under the rules of <I>middat hadin</I>, so that when <I>Benei Yisrael</I> sinned they should have immediately been destroyed. <I>Middat hadin</I> dictates that immediate and complete punishment be meted out to one who sins. Eventually, <I>Hashem</I> gave <I>Benei Yisrael</I> another chance and instructed them in the 13 <I>middot shel rachamim</I> , thereby enabling a second <I>kabbalat hatorah</I>. It is this second <I>kabbalat hatorah</I> that binds us today a world of the combined <I>middot</I>.</P>

<P>This change from a pure <I>middat hadin</I> to one tempered by <I>middat harachamim</I> is not an event that occurred only at the time of creation or at the time of <I>matan torah</I>- this shift takes place every year. <I>Rosh Hashana</I> is the <I>yom hadin</I> in the strict sense. Corresponding to the original creation, the world should be judged according to the <I>middat hadin</I>. Yet, <I>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</I> knows that we cannot withstand judgement under those terms so He gave us <I>Yom Hakippurim</I> as a chance to be judged according to <I>middat harachamim</I>. </P>

<P>As the entire world could not stand up to the strictness of <I>middat hadin</I> so to the Jewish people could not live up to the first set of <I>luchot</I>. There are individuals who have reached such an elevated spiritual level that <I>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</I>can relate to them according to the <I>middat hadin</I>. These are the <I>tzadikkim</I> towards whom <I>Hashem</I> is "<I>medakdek kechut hasearah</I>." These are the <I>tzadikkim gemurim</I> who do not need <I>Yom Kippur</I>. <I>Chazal </I> tell us that such people are inscribed for life on <I>Rosh Hashana</I>. The day of <I>middat harachamim</I> is only necessary for the <I>benoni</I> - the average person who most of humanity is comprised of. Such people can not live up to the standards of <I>din</I>.</P>

<P>With the <I>yomim noraim</I> still fresh in our minds, let us focus on where we stand in our <I>avodat Hashem</I> as we read <I>parshat Bereishit</I>. Are we going to live our lives like the average person who needs a second creation? Are we going to succumb to the <I>chet haegel</I> in whatever form it manifests itself and need a second set of <I>luchot</I>? Perhaps we can elevate ourselves so that by next <I>Rosh Hashana</I> we are all included in the category of <I>tzadikkim gemurim.</P></I>

<P>


<P>&#9;As the second half of <I>sefer Shemot </I>focuses primarily on the 
construction of the <I>Mishkan, </I>the tragic <I>eigel </I>tale sticks out, 
seemingly unrelated to its neighboring <I>perakim.  </I>Rashi, however 
(<I>Shemos </I>31:18), sees a response to the <I>chet ha-eigel </I>in the 
Tabernacle construction, explaining that the <I>Mishkan </I>helped Israel 
to achieve a <I>kappara </I>for their sin.  Interestingly, in <I>Bamidbar </I>
(19:2) Rashi understands the <I>mitzva </I>of the <I>Para Aduma </I>as 
fulfilling a similar function.  How did these two, apparently different,
 <I>mitzvot </I>serve as a <I>kappara </I>for the same <I>chet</I>?</P>
 
<P>&#9;If we are to understand how a <I>mitzva </I>can serve as a <I>kappara,
 </I>we must comprehend the sin for which it atones.  What was Israel's 
 motivation in creating the golden calf?  In his <I>Kuzari, </I>Rav Yehuda 
 haLevi explains that the <I>benei Yisrael</I> had no initial intent to worship 
 <I>avoda zara.  </I>Rather, they sought a this-worldly manifestation of God's 
 presence.  This desire, not intrinsically wrong, was satisfied by the <I>binyan 
 haMishkan.  </I>What differentiated the <I>eigel </I>from the <I>Mishkan?</P>

<P>&#9;</I>The answer can be found in the last several <I>pesukim </I>of <I>
sefer Shemot.  </I>Concerning every act involved in the <I>binyan haMishkan, 
</I>the Torah takes pains to assure us that it was performed "<I>ka-asher 
tziva Hasehm es Moshe.</I>"  The emphasis of this recurring phrase contains 
the simple yet fundamental difference between the <I>eigel </I>and the 
<I>Mishkan.  </I>Both were intended to serve as vehicles with which to relate 
to the Divine, yet one became <I>avoda zara </I>and the other became the 
dwelling place of the <I>Shekhina.  </I>The <I>Mishkan </I>was built because 
Hashem had commanded it; each detail was adhered to precisely as God had 
instructed.  Only in such a manner can a physical entity serve as a <I>makom 
</I>for the <I>hashra'as haShekhina.  </I>A plan devised by man without the 
Almighty's specific instruction will ultimately result in <I>Avoda Zara.  
</I>The lesson to be learned after the <I>eigel </I>incident was that the God's
 presence would rest in Israel only if His specific commanded methods of 
 attaining this goal were adhered to.  As such, the <I>Mishkan </I>was the 
 ultimate <I>kappara </I>for the <I>chet ha-eigel.  Klal Yisrael </I>would
  ultimately merit an earthly manifestation of Hashem's glory, but only 
  "<I>ka-asher tziva Hashem es Moshe.</I>"</P>

<P>&#9;With this understanding of the root of the <I>chet ha-eigel, 
</I>the <I>para aduma's </I>role in the <I>kappara </I>is equally apparent.  
The red heifer could be called the "<I>chok </I>par excellence." 
 As a <I>chok, </I>it reinforces to us the message that our <I>avodat Hashem </I>
 must be dictated by God.  We cannot rationalize the meaning of a <I>chok, 
 </I>yet we perform it nonetheless.  This is the antithesis of the mistake that 
 led to the <I>eigel</i>.  Rather than relying on our human perception of what 
 is spiritually appropriate, we subjugate ourselves totally to the <I>retzon 
 Hashem, </I>and only in this manner will we attain <I>hashra'as haShekhina. 
 </I>Furthermore, the <I>para aduma </I>serves not merely as an atonement for 
 the <I>eigel</i>, but as a prerequisite for entering the <I>Mishkan.  </I>Only 
 when these <I>mitzvos </I>work in tandem- when we learn from both that
  <I>avodas Hashem </I>is dictated by "<I>ka-asher tziva Hasehm es 
  Moshe</I>"-<I> </I>can the <I>chet ha-eigel</I> be eradicated.  </P>

<P>&#9;The concept of the <I>Mishkan </I>being the ultimate expression of 
"<I>ka-asher tziva Hashem es Moshe" </I>was endangered by Nadav and 
Avihu offering <I>ketores  </I>"<I>asher lo tziva osam,</I>" which 
they were not commanded to offer.  A dedication of the <I>Mishkan </I>which 
did not follow God's precise instructions would undermine its entire message. 
 Such actions were therefore punished severely.  </P>

<P>&#9;May we be <I>zoche </I>to learn the message of the <I>Mishkan </I>and
 the <I>para aduma, </I>and may we live our lives "<I>ka-asher tziva
  Hashem es Moshe.</I>"</P>

<P>&#9;Throughout <I>Sefer Bereishit</I> there is great degree of significance associated with names. A name is not merely a way to call someone but, rather, it encapsulates the essence of the individual. Both Avraham and Yaakov received names at birth, yet their names were changed later in life as certain events unfolded. <I>Chazal</I> in <I>Masechet Berachot</I> (13a), draw a distinction between the change in the name of "Avram" to "Avraham" and the change of "Yaakov" to "Yisrael".</P>
<P>&#9;Once Avraham received his new name no one was permitted to refer to him by his previous name "Avram", whereas Yaakov is constantly referred to as both "Yaakov" and "Yisrael". Avraham received a new mission, to be "<I>av hamon goyim</I>", a father to many nations, and as such, his previous title, "<I>Av leAram"</I>, the father of his own home, is inappropriate. What is it about the name "Yaakov" that it remained alongside "Yisrael"?</P>
<P>&#9;The dual name "Yaakov-Yisrael" reflects two aspects of Yaakov's life. He entered the world be hind his brother, gRavng his heel, being stepped on by Esav. The name "Yaakov" is synonymous with all the difficulties he would endure while dealing with his brother. When Yaakov was victorious in his fight with the angel, who <I>chazal</I> interpret to be the Angel of Esav, Yaakov was given a new name, "Yisrael", meaning, one who has overcome his foes. There are times when he was victorious and as such referred to as "Yisrael", yet he endured many hardships, and was constantly reminded that he was also "Yaakov". </P>
<P>&#9;The most poignant expression of this appears in <I>Bereishit</I> (46:1-2) when Yaakov was tRaveling to <I>mitzrayim</I> to see Yosef. It was the highpoint of his life, going to greet his son that for 22 years he had thought was dead. The Torah describes the triumphant Yisrael going to <I>Mitzrayim</I>: G-d appeared to him and called him "Yaakov, Yaakov",you are going to galut, your descendants will be enslaved. This is the beginning of a dark chapter in the history of the Jewish people. You may be personally experiencing the emotions of "Yisrael", but be aware that this is the beginning of the period of "Yaakov."</P>
<P>&#9;The duality that exists within "Yaakov" repeats itself throughout the history of his descendants. The <I>Sefer haChinuch</I>, in <I>Mitzvah 3</I> explains that the prohibition of eating the <I>gid hanasheh</I> is symbolic of our entire history. Yaakov is victorious in hid struggle against Esav, but he is wounded in battle. </P>
<P>&#9;Esav succeeded in injuring Yaakov's leg even though he could not defeat him. This is true throughout Jewish history. Ultimately the Jewish people will emerge victorious from all of its struggles, but there will be costly sacrifices along the way. We are constantly wounded as a people yet we survive and prosper and will ultimately emerge from exile. </P>
<P>&#9;<I>"Maaseh avot siman lebanim," - </I>the lives of the forefathers foreshadow  events in the lives of their descendants. Just as Yaakov emerged from his battle with Esav victoriously, so should we merit redemption from our exile , and reach the heights of Yisrael.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Then Yosef said to his brothers, 'Come close to me, if you please," and they came close. And he said, 'I am Yosef your brother - it is me, whom you sold into Egypt. And now be not distressed or reproach yourselves for having sold me here, for it was to be a provider that God sent me here ahead of you ...Thus God has sent me ahead of you to ensure your survival in the land and to sustain you...and now it was not you who sent me here but God;...<SUP>1</P>
</SUP>
</blockquote>

<P>These verses are, <I>primo facie</I>, very problematic. Seemingly, Yosef exonerated the brothers from all responsibility in his sale. Ostensibly, Yosef viewed his trials and tRavails as divinely ordained, and the brothers as mere involuntary divine instruments. This understanding, however, seems untenable. The Torah's narrative in <I>Parshat Vayeshev</I> describes a natural progression culminating in the brothers' willful sale of Yosef. </P>
<blockquote>
When his brothers realized that their father loved him more than all the rest, they began to hate him...Then Yosef had a dream...'Do you want to be our king?' retorted the brothers. Because of his dreams and words, they hated him even more...His brothers became very jealous of him...They saw him in the distance and before he reached them, they were plotting to kill him...Judah said to his brothers, 'What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover his blood? Let us sell him...<SUP>2</SUP> </P>
</blockquote>

<P>Moreover, Yosef's own words preclude any possible exoneration of his brothers. In disclosing his identity to his brothers - just moments before he seemingly exonerated them, Yosef himself sharply rebuked them.</P>

<blockquote>
<P>And Yosef said to his brothers...'I am Yosef. Is my father still alive?' But his brothers could not answer him because they were left disconcerted before him.<SUP>3</SUP>
</blockquote>

<P>The Talmud explains that the brothers were silenced by the sting of Yosef's rebuke.</P>

<blockquote>
When Reb Elazar would reach this verse he would cry, 'But his brothers could not answer him because they were disconcerted before him.' The rebuke of flesh and blood is so [forceful] - how much more so the rebuke of the Holy One Blessed be He!<SUP>4</SUP>
</blockquote>

<P>The Beis HaLevi explicates the words of <I>Chazal</I>.<SUP>5</SUP> Yosef's question regarding "my father" was not an innocent inquiry. The brothers had not returned home since their last audience with Yosef, and thus had no updated information regarding Yaakov. Instead, Yosef's query was accusatory and remonstrative: Is it possible that my father is still alive despite the profound agony you caused him by selling me? Clearly, Yosef considered the brothers culpable in his sale. What then was Yosef expressing when he attributed the vicissitudes of his life to <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i> and disassociated the brothers therefrom?</P>

<P>The answer to this question encapsulates fundamental Jewish teachings regarding human responsibility and divine providence.<SUP>6</SUP> On the one hand, <I>Yahadus</I> adamantly affirms human free will and concomitant responsibility.</P>

<blockquote>
Free will is granted to every human being. If one desires to turn toward the good way and be righteous he has the power to do so. If one wishes to turn toward the evil way and be wicked, he is at liberty to do so...This doctrine is an important principle, the pillar of the Law and the commandment...Therefore, a person is judged according to his deeds - if he did good he is rewarded, if he did evil he is punished<SUP>.7</SUP>
</blockquote>

<P>On the other hand, <I>Yahadus</I> also affirms that divine providence is all-encompassing. I.e., nothing befalls a person haphazardly or by happenstance; everything is divinely ordained.</P>

<blockquote>
A person should know and internalize that everything that befalls him, good or bad, is caused by God, blessed is He. And from the hand of his fellow man nothing can come about without the will of God, blessed be He.<SUP>8</SUP>
</blockquote>

<P>The Torah's teachings regarding free will, human responsibility, and divine providence may be summarized thusly: as subjects, people act with unrestrained free will.<SUP>9</SUP> What we do is voluntarily done. Hence, we are entirely responsible for all our actions. As objects, however, people are governed by divine providence. How - if at all - we are impacted by the voluntary actions of others, is determined by divine providence. Hence, human responsibility not withstanding, <I>Hashem</I> is the true and only cause of everything that happens to us. <SUP>10</SUP></P>

<P>Of these two propositions, the former is intuitive. We intuitively sense our freedom of action. The latter proposition, however, is unintuitive. Viewed through the Kantian lens of cause and effect, other people's free will appears to impact upon us. Appearances, however, can be beguiling because <I>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</I> offtimes  clandestinely exercises <I>hashgacha</I> <I>peratis</I> through natural channels.</P>

<P>The Ravnic providential lens provides a different perspective, as illustrated in the following Talmudic passage:</P>

<blockquote>
But if he did not lie in wait, but God caused it to come to his head, etc...As the proverb of the ancient one says, 'From the wicked comes forth wickedness, etc.' What is this verse talking about? About two people each of whom killed a person. One killed inadvertently, and one killed intentionally. This one has no witnesses and this one has no witnesses. The Holy One Blessed is He arranges that they come to the same inn. The one who killed intentionally sits under a ladder, while the one who killed inadvertently descends the ladder and falls upon him and kills him. The one who had killed intentionally is killed, and the one who killed inadvertently is exiled.<SUP>11</SUP>
</blockquote>

<P>A seemingly random accident occurred because - and only because - it effected divinely ordained consequences. The exercise of free will is unrestricted, but its effects are divinely determined and choreographed. With striving and sensitivity we can adopt the providential lens and, our vision thereby invigorated and enriched, at times, discern the guiding hand of providence.</P>

<P><i>Yosef HaTzaddik</i>'s reaction to his ordeal reflected this subject / object distinction and providential principle. On the one hand, he recognized that his brothers acted voluntarily and accordingly held them responsible for their actions; hence his sharp rebuke. On the other hand, Yosef also understood that <I>Hakadosh Baruch Hu </I>allowed the brothers to implement their designs because - and only because - his ordeal was divinely ordained. <I>Hashem</I> was the true, ultimate  cause of his (mis)fortune. Hence, as depicted by the <I>medrash<SUP>12</SUP> </I>he immediately responded to his sale by repenting and never desired revenge. Human nature impels us to seek revenge from those who are responsible for our plight. When we recognize that <I>Hashem</I> is the ultimate and first cause of everything which we, as objects, endure, then the very thought of revenge becomes nonsensical.</P>

<P>Yosef encapsulated this profound teaching in his response to his brothers. He was, at once, remonstrative and reassuring. "Is my father still alive?" - as subjects you acted freely  and thus sinned grievously. "It was not you who sent me here, but God." - as an object, my destiny was exclusively determined by the will of God. And thus do not be disconcerted; I do not seek revenge.</P>

<P>In fact, the <I>Sefer HaChinuch</I> articulates this providential principle as the rationale for the Torah's prohibition against revenge:</P>

<blockquote>
Amongst the reasons for the <I>mitzvah</I>: that a person should know and internalize that anything that befalls him, good or bad is caused by God, blessed be He. And from the hand of his fellow man nothing can come about without the will of God, blessed is He. Therefore, when someone causes him distress or pain, a person should know in his soul that his sins are the cause, and <I>Hashem</I> may He be blessed decreed this upon him, and he should not train his thoughts to exact revenge from him because he is not the source of his misfortune, because sin is the cause.<SUP>13</SUP>
</blockquote>

<P>It is worth noting that the foregoing analysis of free will and divine providence also encapsulates a philosophy of history. History unfolds on two levels and accordingly may be properly studied bilaterally.<SUP>14</SUP> History unfolds naturally, its agents acting freely. Accordingly, the natural causes and contexts of their actions may be probed. Simultaneously, history unfolds supernaturally, its course set and steered by <I>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</I>. Accordingly, the ultimate causes of historical events are located in the religio-providential realm and, when possible, history ought to be explored accordingly.<SUP>15</SUP></P>

<P>Upon reflection we find instances of such bilateral historical analysis in <I>Chazal</I>:</P>

<blockquote>
Rav Chama son of Gurya said in the name of Rav: a person should never show favoritism amongst his children because on account of two <I>selaim</I> of choice wool with which Yaakov made a woolen garment for Yosef his brothers became envious and things evolved and our ancestors became ensnared in Egypt.<SUP>16</SUP>
</blockquote>

<P><I>Chazal</I> identified the natural trigger for the chain of events culminating in servitude in Egypt. Nonetheless, it is abundantly clear that the ultimate cause was providential, as had been foretold to Avraham:</P>

<blockquote>
And He said to Avram, 'Know that your descendants will be strangers in a foreign land, and they will enslave and torture them.'<SUP>17</SUP>
</blockquote>

<P>And, in conclusion, we should note that the providential principle, and <i>Yosef HaTzaddik</i>'s application thereof illustrate a pivotal concept within <I>yahadus</I>. <I>Yahadus</I> comprised of creed and deed, teaches that belief molds behavior. Case in point: belief in divine providence is not simply an intellectual conviction; rather, as evidenced in the foregoing analysis, it also molds our actions and reactions, undercutting personal animosity and desire for revenge.</P>

<P>6.  In this essay I operate with the conception that divine providence is all-encompassing, as explained in the text. While this view is vigorously and explicitly expoused by some <I>Rishonim</I> and in some <I>maamarei Chazal</I> as documented below, it does not represent a consensus <I>omnium</I>.

<B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">I</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The commandment to light the <I>menorah</I> daily in the <I>Beit Hamikdosh</I> follows immediately after the dedication of the 
<I>Mishkan</I> by the <I>Nesi'im</I>.  Rashi comments that these two sections are juxtaposed in the Torah to tell us that Aharon felt badly that he did not take 
part in the dedication.  To console Aharon, God gave him the mitzvah of lighting the <I>menorah</I>, and told him, "Yours is greater than theirs 
[the <I>nesi'im</I>], for you light the candles daily."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Rashi's comment requires explanation.  After all, Aharon was told of the <I>mitzvah</I> of lighting the <I>menorah</I> long 
before the dedication of the <I>Mishkan</I> (see <I>Shmot</I>, 27:21; <I>Vayikra</I>, 24:3). How was he consoled by God's answer?  Furthermore,
 why was Aharon upset by being left out of the dedication?  Certainly, he was not insulted by being excluded from the honor of the ceremonies!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;A dedication has a great and lasting significance.  The peak of excitement attained at the outset of any undertaking must provide 
inspiration for the entire lifetime of the person or institution involved.  Aharon feared that he and his descendants would lack the excitement that all 
other Jews had gained through their participation in the dedication. To allay Aharon's fears, God responded that the <I>mitzvah</I> of the <I>menorah</I> would 
be an even greater source of spiritual invigoration for him and his descendants.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why was the <I>menorah</I> singled out among all the <I>mitzvot</I> of the <I>Kohanim</I> as an inspiration even more powerful and 
lasting than that of the dedication of the <I>Mishkan</I>? The answer lies in the symbolism of the <I>menorah</I>. The menorah represents Torah, and 
the study of Torah, unlike other <I>mitzvot</I>, constantly affords new insights.  Because of his involvement with the <I>menorah</I> and Torah, Aharon 
did not need the excitement of the dedication.  For Aharon, every day was new and refreshing, as the words of the Torah are like new to us each day
 (Rashi, D'varim 6:6).  Therefore, Aharon's source of constant spiritual regeneration was, indeed, greater than that of the <I>Nesi'im</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">II</P>
</B>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rashi (<I>ibid.</I>) teaches that the words of Torah should be <U>like</U> new to us each day. The Talmud (Chagiga 3a),
 however, states that Torah <U>is</U> new, and tells us that it is impossible to be in a <I>Beit Medrash</I> without a <I>chiddush</I>. How can we 
 account for the difference between Rashi's teaching, that the Torah should be <U>like</U> new, and the statement of the Talmud, that the Torah 
 <U>is</U> new? Rashi refers to "these words," the written <I>Torah,</I> which is unchanging, but must be in our eyes as if it were new.
   The Talmud<I> </I>describes the Oral Torah, which is studied in a <I>Beit Medrash</I>.  Talmudic discourse inevitably yields fresh insights and, 
   as such, is really new. The Talmud (<I>ibid. </I>3b) further expresses the freshness and expansion of Torah when it explains the passage 
   (Koheles 12:11) that compares words of Torah to plantings, saying that just as a plant procreates, so to the words of Torah procreate.  This 
   metaphor is also utilized in our daily prayers, when we bless God for implanting eternal life within us, "<I>v'chayei olam nata b'tocheinu</I>".</P>
   
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Let us take a moment to further discuss the procreation of Torah by examining the aforementioned phrase in conjunction with 
two others that precede it in our prayers. The first phrase, which immediately precedes it, states "<I>v'natan lanu Torat Emet", </I>"and 
God<I> </I>gave us the Torah of truth".  The Beit Halevi (Yitro) explains that God giving <U>us</U> the Torah of truth refers to the written 
law, whose truth is determined by the interpretation of the Sages, which comprises the ever-expanding Oral law. The second phrase, which appears 
before the two phrases quoted above, states, "<I>Baruch Hu</I> <I>Elokeinu shebra'anu lichvodo vihivdilanu min hatoim",</I> "Blessed is
 God<I> </I>Who created us for His glory and separated us from those who stray."  What does this juxtaposition teach us?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Perhaps the last phrase represents a prerequisite for innovation in Torah.  Unchecked creativity can lead to false and even 
dangerous procreation.  In order for a novel interpretation to be part of <I>Torat Emet</I>, ultimate and eternal truth, its author must not stray, 
and must be separated from those who stray.  How can this be assured?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If one recognizes that he was created to serve God and enhance <I>K'vod Shomayim </I>(the glory of Heaven in the eyes of men), 
then he will not stray.  By contrast, if one is interested in greater self-actualization and in adding to his own glory, then he will likely stray from the truth. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In other words, we must begin by stating categorically that our role in this world is to bring honor to God.  We will thereby 
avoid straying from the truth of Torah.  And lest one think that, as a result, there is no room for originality and creativity in Torah, we conclude 
by alluding to the inevitable positive procreation of Torah which is implanted within us.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The modern Western world has strayed from this fundamental principle which is now disparaged as fundamentalism.  Modern man and 
woman are interested in self-gratification and actualization.  For the spiritually inclined, this manifests itself not as hedonism but as religious subjectivism.  
If it feels good, do it, and, if you are Jewish, call it a <I>mitzvah.</I>  This unholy procreation of those who have strayed poses a serious threat to authentic
 Torah study and practice.</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: toldos]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>&#9;The <I>parsha</I> of <I>Toldos</I> contains the source for the <I>bracha</I> made on the occasion of a <I>Bar-Mitzvah</I>. When Esav and Yaakov reached manhood (<I>vayigdelu</I>), Esav became a hunter, while Yaakov entered the tents of study. The <I>midrash</I> comments that from this verse we derive that a father must attend to his son until the son turns thirteen. At that time the father says, "<I>Baruch shepetarani meonsho shel zeh</I>" (Blessed is He who exempted me from the punishment of this [boy]). </P>
<P>&#9;The <I>Magen Avraham </I>(225:5) explains that after <I>Bar-Mitzvah</I> a father is no longer punished for the sins of his son. The <I>Levush</I> interprets that after <I>Bar-Mitzvah</I> the son is no longer punished for the sins of his father. Both understandings share the same difficulty: Why isn't the same <I>brocha</I>&nbsp;recited for a daughter and by a mother? The <I>Pri Megadim</I> (op.cit) raises this question and answers based on very questionable assumptions.</P>
<P>&#9;Perhaps the <I>bracha</I> can be explained differently based on the first <I>halacha</I> of the <I>Rambam's</I> <I>Hilchos Talmud Torah</I>: "Women, slaves, and children (<I>ketanim</I>) are exempted from <I>Talmud Torah</I>, but a father is commanded to teach his young child (<I>katan</I>) <I>Torah</I>." Two questions can be raised. First, why does the <I>Rambam</I> mention only a <I>katan</I>? Isn't a father required to teach his son after <I>Bar-Mitzvah</I>? Second, why does the <I>Rambam</I> begin with an exemption? Wouldn't it be more logical to state the obligation before the exemption? </P>
<P>&#9;It would seem that according to the <I>Rambam</I> , one cannot be commanded to teach someone who himself is obligated to learn. Therefore, it is necessary to mention the fact that <I>ketanim</I> are exempt from <I>talmud torah</I> before stating the obligation of the father to teach him. While a father is certainly responsible for his son's education beyond <I>Bar-Mitzvah</I>, this obligation does not fall under the specific <I>mitzvah</I> of teaching. (<I>Velimadtem</I>. Compare<I> Chazon Ish</I> Y.D. 152:1).</P>
<P>&#9;In this light, the <I>bracha</I> is the father's statement of gratitude that he has completed his <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>velimadtem</I> and is no longer punishable for it. This interpretation is supported by the context of the <I>bracha</I>'s <I>midrashic</I> source.: A father must care for his son for thirteen years, after which the son himself must choose the tents of study over the hunting field. Since <I>velimadtem</I> does not apply to daughters or mothers, the <I>bracha</I> is not needed for or by them. </P>
<P>&#9;The <I>Magen Avraham</I> (ibid:4), citing the <I>Zohar</I>, requires that a father make a festive meal when his son becomes <I>Bar-Mitzvah</I> just as he makes for his son's wedding. The <I>Machtzes Hashekel</I> (op.cit) equates this with the <I>Maharshal'</I>s view that a <I>Bar-Mitzvah</I> seudah celebrates the boy's becoming commanded to do <I>mitzvot</I> (<I>metzuveh veoseh</I> Sec B.K. 87a). This equation is questionable, for it seems that while the <I>Maharshal</I> requires the son to celebrate<I> </I>, the <I>Zohar's</I> obligation relates to the father. The <I>Zohar's</I> comparison to a wedding reflects a father's <I>mitzvah</I> to celebrate whenever he has completed one of his obligations towards his son, namely <I>milah, pidyon haben, </I>teaching him <I>Torah</I> and marrying him off (<I>Kiddushin 29a)</I>.</P>
<P>&#9;This analysis leads to a compromise view concerning <I>Bat-Mitzvah</I> celebrations. The <I>Yechaveh Daas</I> (II, 29), citing the <I>Maharshal's </I>reasoning, which applies equally to girls, equates <I>Bar</I> and <I>Bat-Mitzvahs.</I> <I>Igros Moshe </I>&nbsp;(O.C. I.104: II,97) states that a <I>Bat-Mitzvah</I> party is not a <I>seudat mitzvah</I> at all. It would seem that the <I>Maharshal's</I> reason does, in fact, apply and therefore the girl is required to make a party for her close friends and family. However, a wedding-like feast, which reflects the completion of the father's obligation of <I>velimadtem</I>, applies, like the <I>bracha</I> of <I>Baruch shepetarani</I>, to a <I>Bar-Mitzvah</I> only.</P>

<P>
     <I>Parshat Shmot</i> not only introduces us to the Egyptian <I>galut</i> but
     provides important insight into future <I>galuyot</i> and the redemption
     therefrom. When the Torah informs us, <I>"vehasne einenu ukal,"</i> it
     means that not only were Benei Yisrael not consumed by
     Mitzrayim, but that similarly future foes will not be successful in
     the eradication of the Jewish nation.
<P>
     I believe that the fact that Moshe is raised by Bat Paroh in Paroh's
     very home, under his nose, shows not only incredible hashgacha
     but a kind of Divine irony. From the "bad" "good" emerges. This is
     what we recite at the Pesach Seder: <I>"Hakadosh Baruch Hu
     matzileinu miyadam"</i> - that Hashem saves us "from the hands",
     literally from within their hands.
<P>
     Historically, this happened when Hitler, <I>yimach shemo</i>, evicted
     Jewish scientists from Germany, including Albert Einstein. They
     were literally in his hands, willing to work for Germany.
<P>
     In 1998, in Kiev, I personally experienced a group of college age
     students who explained how they came to yahadut. They related
     that upon completion of High School, with honors, they were
     denied admission to university because they were Jewish. This
     incident caused them to investigate what it meant to be a Jew. The
     very government that sought to strip them of their religion, caused
     them to turn to their religion due to discrimination.
<P>
     What is true in the overall course of history also applies to the
     individual. For individuals experiencing <I>hashgacha</i>, setbacks or
     sickness, G-d forbid, it is often difficult to envision that the
     experience is all part of a Divine plan from which good will come.
     The Chafetz Chaim zt"l says that the response at such a time is,
     <I>"meg zagin az iz bitter,"</i> one is permitted to say, "it is bitter."
     However, <I>"min tor nit zagin az iz shlect,"</i> one is not permitted to
     say, "it is bad.".
<P>
     Moshe, at the end of the <I>parshah</i> does say, "it is bad." In the
     penultimate pasuk he says, <I>"umeaz bati el paroh ledaber
     bishmecha heira laam hazeh,"</i> -"From the time that I have come to
     Pharoh to speak in your name is has become bad for this nation."
     The medrash on the Shira teaches that Moshe had a change of
     heart and realized that he was wrong. He therefore began the
     Shira with the word <I>"az"</i>- as if to say, "I originally sinned with the
     word 'az' now I say <I>shira</i> with the word 'az'. The Beis HaLevi
     understands this to mean that Moshe is singing <I>shira</i> not only for
     the salvation and redemption, but even for the servitude itself.
     Commensurate with the suffering is the ultimate sanctification of
     Hashem's name.
<P>
     Interestingly, Chazal tell us that the formal back-breaking servitude
     began with the birth of Miriam. (Note that her name stems from the
     root "bitter".) The Maharal Diskin says that Yaakov recited Shema
     when he was reunited with Yosef as he realized <I>"Hashem echad"</i>
     the bitter and the sweet. the absence of Yosef and the
     reunification with him all stemmed from the same Hashem. May we
     be so privileged to learn this lesson.

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parshat Tzitzit</I> has the distinction of being incorporated as part of the daily <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>Keriat Shema</I>. Every night and morning Jews are to recite 3 <I>parshiot</I>: <I>Shema</I>, <I>Vehayah im shamoa, </I>and <I>Vayomer. </I> The reason for this specific order of recitation, even though <I>Vayomer</I> (<I>tzitzit</I>) is written in the Torah before the first paragraph, is given in the first <I>Mishna</I> of the second <I>perek </I>of <I>Berachot: </I>"R' Yehoshua ben Korchah taught that <I>shema</I> precedes <I>vehaya</I> as first one accepts upon himself the yoke of God's sovereignty (<I>kabbalat ol malchut shamayim</I>) and then accepts the yoke of god's commandments. The reason <I>"Vehaya im shamoa" </I>precedes "<I>Vayomer</I>" is that the <I>mitzvah</I> of studying (<I>talmud</I>) Torah, which is found in "<I>Vehaya</I>", applies both by day and by night, whereas the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>tzitzit</I> applies only by day."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Rambam in the first chapter (Halachah 2) of the laws of <I>keriat shema</I> teaches, in keeping with the <I>gemara</I> in <I>Berachot</I> 12b, that <I>"shema"</I> is recited first as it contains passages teaching the oneness of God, and the commandment to love Him and study His Torah. <I>Vehaya</I> then contains the charge to observe the <I>mitzvot</I> of the Torah, followed by the <I>parshah</I> of <I>tzitzit</I> as this too discusses this charge. What is found in the third <I>parshah</I> of <I>tzitzit</I> that is not contained in the second <I>parshah</I> of <I>"Vehaya im shamoa"?</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Rav z"l suggested the following explanation. The <I>halachah</I> clearly states that one is obligated to affix <I>tzitzit</I> to a four-cornered garment; one not wearing such a garment is exempt from the Torah obligation. The Torah does not instruct us to wear a four-cornered garment in order to fulfill this <I>mitzvah</I>. (<I>Gemara Menachot</I> 41a warns that at a time when there is Divine anger and punishment, one is punished even for the neglect of an <I>asseh </I>- the failure to observe a positive <I>mitzvah</I>.) It is for this reason that we recite our acceptance of mitzvot twice daily. The first, "<I>Vehaya im shamoa"</I>, is for those <I>mitzvot</I> that one must observe, such as <I>shemirat shabbat</I>, <I>kashruth</I>, and returning a lost object. The second acceptance refers to those <I>mitzvot</I> that one does not have to fulfill but wants to. The recitation of <I>Parshat Tzitzit </I>indicates our love for and positive attitude towards <I>mitzvot</I>. <I>Mitzvot</I> are to be viewed as a privilege and not as a burden. Though according to the letter of the law I may be excused from fulfilling a particular <I>mitzvah,</I> I wish to put myself in a situation that will enable me to be obligated to fulfill it. (This applies to <I>mezzuzah</I> and <I>maakah</I> as well.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, this follows the powerful lesson recited in <I>Parshat Behaalotcha </I>(8:7) of "<I>Lama nigara?" </I>i.e. Why is it that due to being <I>tameh nefesh</I>, ritually impure after having come into contact with a dead body, we are deprived of the opportunity and privilege of offering <I>korban Pesach</I>? The Jews speaking in the <I>passuk</I> did not have to fulfil the <I>mitsvah</I> of <I>korban Pesach</I>, but they <U>wanted to</U>. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May we be privileged to include these uplifting thoughts in our minds when we recite <I>Parshat Tzitzit</I> daily, recalling our commitment to and acceptance of all <I>mitzvot</I>, not only because we have to, but because we want to!  </P>

<P>Rav Chaim Volozoner in his work on Pirkei Avos comments that in contrast to the <I>mishna</I> (Avos 5:3) which states, "there were ten generations between Noah and Avraham", which merely states a historical fact, the subsequent <I>mishna</I> ("Avraham Avinu our father was tested with 10 test, and he passed them all" (Avos 5:4)) informs us of the strength of character that Avraham bequeathed to later generations. The ability of Jews to die <I>Al kidush hashem</I>, to give up their lives when necessary in order to sanctify God's name, stems from our father Avaraham's sacrifice of his son Yitschok. This is stated explicitly in the Talmud (Gittin 57) when Channah, whose seven sons allowed themselves to be killed rather than commit idolatrous acts, said, "you Avraham made an <I>akeida</I> of one scarifice, and I made an <I>akeida</I> of seven sacrifices".</P>

<P>The Talmud in Chulin (142) teaches that one does not receive reward for <I>mitzvos</I> in this world. The reason, as explained by the Chofetz Chaim, is that <I>mitzvos</I> are spiritual in nature, and one can not properly receive a reward for a spiritual act through a physical medium. In light of the aforementioned statement of the Talmud, the Gaon of Vilna comments (in <I>Kol Eliyahu</I>) that it would seem that we should not be able to derive benefit from the <I>mitzvos</I> of our fore-fathers, including the <I>akeida</I>. And yet, we see that much of our efforts to return in repentance and secure forgiveness from God on Rosh Hashana is based on the <I>akeida</I>! In our prayers, we ask God to forgive us in the merit of the <I>akeida</I>; we blow a ram's horn to remember the <I>akeida</I>; among the reasons that we go to a body of water to recite <I>Tashlich</I> is to remember Avraham's determination to fulfill the word of God, and go to the <I>akeida</I> despite obstacles put in his way by the <I>Satan</I> including a body of water. The Gaon explains, that the benefit we derive is not from the <I>mitsvo</I> itself that Avraham performed, but rather from his actions of the two days leading up to the <I>akeida</I>. We benefit from Avraham's <I>zrizus</I> (enthusiasm and zeal) and personal involvement that goes beyond the actual fulfillment of the commandment of God. We receive reward for Avraham's waking up early in the morning to begin the journey to the <I>akeida</I>, for saddling his donkey himself, and for personally cutting the wood for the <I>akeida</I>. </P>

<P>This understanding of what benefit we derive from the <I>akeida</I> also explains the Medrash on the verse (Vayera (22:4)) "On the third day, Avraham raised his eyes and perceived the place from afar". The Medrash Braishis Rabbah (56:1) quotes a verse from Hoshea (6:2), "He will sustain us after two days, on the third day he will raise up and we will live before Him". What relevance does this verse have to the akeida? The Medrash is saying that the verse in Hoshea tells us that we are sustained in this world by Avraham's actions on the two days preceding the <I>akeida </I>("He will sustain us after two days"), and ultimately in the future we will receive the complete reward for the actual <I>akeida</I>, which occurred on the third day ("on the third day he will raise up").</P>

<P>There are two important lessons to be learned from the comment of the Gaon of Vilna. First, we see how important our personal attitude and motivation in the performance of <I>mitzvos</I> is. Are we motivated by joy, love, and a true sense of privilege to perform a <I>mitzvo</I>? The Imrei Emes writes that it is because of the importance of attitude that the special ceremony which took place on <I>Sukkot</I> in the <I>Beis Hamikdosh</I> was called the "<I>Simchas Bais Ha-shoaiva</I>" ("joy of the place of the drawing of the water"). The <I>mitsva </I>on <I>Sukkot</I> was to pour the water on the alter, not draw the water, so why is the drawing of the water emphasized in the name given to the occasion? The Imrei Emes explains that the drawing is emphasized because it was done with happiness and joy (see the fifth chapter in Tractate <I>Sukkah</I> for details), and for that joy we are rewarded in this world.</P>
<P>Secondly, we see how significant our actions are not only for ourselves, but also for subsequent generations. Our enthusiasm not only teaches by example in this generation, but also provides subsequent generations with merits they can draw upon in their times of need. Avraham teaches us the significance and worth of each person's preparations.</P>

<P>The third of the <I>Arba Parshiyot</I> -- the four special sections read as the Maftir in the weeks surrounding Purim and Pesach, Parshat Parah (Chukat Chapter 19), read this week, concerns the laws of the Red Heifer, the ashes of which were used to purify one who came into contact with the dead. Rashi (Megilla 29a) explains that the reason that this portion is read before the month of Nissan is that all of <I>Klal Yisrael</I> had to purify themselves in preparation for the <I>Korban Pesach</I> -- the Paschal Sacrifice. Even though, to our great sorrow, we are currently not able to bring korbanot, we anxiously look forward to the return of the sacrificial order and therefore remind ourselves of the laws connected to it. </P>
<P>Several <I>Rishonim</I> (earlier authorities) maintain that just as the reading of <I>Parshat Zachor</I> is <I>min haTorah</I> -- biblically mandated -- so too is the reading of <I>Parshat Parah</I> (see Ritva (Megilla 17b), Tosfot HaRosh (B'rachot 13a)). Many <I>Acharonim</I> (later authorities) question the biblical source for such a command (see Magen Avraham (O.C. 685), Bai'ur haGra (ibid)); several offer various suggestions (see Meshech Chachma (Chukat s.v. <I>"hinei"</I>), Birchat Peretz (Chukat)). I have heard from Rav Hershel Schachter <I>shlit"a </I>that the source might be from the mitzva to remember the <I>Cheit Ha'eigel</I> -- the sin of the Golden Calf. In Parshat Eikev (9:7) we read: <I>"Z'chor al tishkach eit asher hiktsafta et Hashem Elokecha b'Choreiv"</I> -- "Remember, do not forget, that which you angered the Lord, your G-d at Choreiv (Sinai)," a reference to the Golden Calf. Rashi (Chukat 19:22) quotes from R. Moshe HaDarshan that the Red Heifer served as an atonement for the sin of the Golden Calf. He uses an allegory concerning a child who dirtied the king's palace. "Let the mother (the Heifer) clean up the mess made by her son (the Golden Calf)." Rashi mentions various aspects of the processing of the <I>Parah Aduma</I> that highlight this connection. By reading <I>Parshat Parah</I>, we thus fulfill our obligation to remember the <I>Cheit Ha'eigel. </P>
</I><P>On a <I>halakhic</I> (Jewish legalistic) level, perhaps we can suggest that the source that the <I>Cheit Ha'eigel</I> must be mentioned orally and not just remembered in our minds is derived through <I>halakhic</I> exegesis similar to that which is applied to the <I>mitzva</I> of remembering Amalek, fulfilled through the reading of <I>Parshat Zachor</I>. The Sifrei (D'varim 25:17) comments on the passage <I>"Zachor eit asher asah l'cha 'Amalek ... lo tishkach!"</I> -- "Remember that which Amalek did to you... do not forget!" as follows: "I might think (you should remember) in your heart, but "do not forget" indicates memory in the heart; what does "Remember" come to teach you? -- with the mouth (to mention it verbally)." According to the aforementioned analysis of the source for the reading of <I>Parshat Parah</I>, the Torah indicates an obligation to orally remember the sin of the Golden Calf. Concerning the <I>Cheit Ha'eigel</I> as well, the Torah states "1) Remember, 2) do not forget." This would seem to imply an obligation to state it verbally and not just remember it mentally. </P>
<P>On a <I>hashkafic</I> (philosophical/ethical) level, I have heard an explanation* as to how <I>the Parah Aduma</I> serves as an atonement for the <I>Cheit Ha'eigel</I>. According to many commentaries (see Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Malbim), the sin of many of the Jewish people in the episode of the Golden Calf was not that they worshiped the Calf as a deity but rather that they used it as a point of focus to worship G-d. Indeed, the <I>keruvim</I>, the cherubs on the <I>aron kodesh </I>(holy Ark), would serve a similar purpose. The sin lay in the fact that G-d had not permitted the image of a calf to be used to achieve this result, and therefore, such service bordered on idolatry. The antidote to the sin of serving G-d in a fashion which he had not commanded would be a wholehearted commitment to <I>chukim</I>, those laws which were commanded but do not have revealed reasons. By faithfully observing the <I>chukim</I>, Jews demonstrate that <I>mitzvot</I>, expressions of the Divine Will, must be observed regardless of our ability to understand them,  and that we cannot invent other forms of Divine service even if, according to our own understanding of the <I>mitzvot</I>, we think that they can achieve the same result. </P>
<P>This approach still leaves us with a question. If the source for reading <I>Parshat Parah</I> is ultimately remembrance of <I>Cheit Ha'eigel</I>, why not read <I>Parshat Ki Tissa</I>, which directly describes the sin itself? Perhaps we can suggest an answer based on a thought expressed by Rav Wolbe <I>shlit"a</I>. When making an assessment of one's weaknesses in preparation for <I>t'shuva</I> (repentance), it is not sufficient to list all the <I>chat'aim</I> (sins) that one has committed. If one only focuses on his deficiencies and moral lapses, how can he be expected to change? What tools can he harness to better himself? Therefore, a person must also make a careful accounting of his positive qualities, those which he can marshal to overcome his deficiencies. It would appear that in the commandment to remember the sin of the Golden Calf, G-d directs us to not only remember our past disastrous error, but to focus on methods with which we can overcome and atone for this great sin. By reading <I>Parshat Parah</I>, symbolizing the full, unquestioning commitment to the <I>d'var Hashem</I> --- the word of G-d -- we stress not the problem but the solution. As we just read in <I>Megilat Ester</I> (9:27), as elaborated upon by <I>Chazal</I> (Shabbat 88a) <I>"Kiy'mu v'kib'lu hay'hudim"</I> -- the Jewish people, in the days of Mordechai and Esther, reaffirmed their commitment to the entirety of <I>Torat Hashem</I>. May we merit to always maintain this state of devotion </P>
<P>*I would welcome being reminded of the source of this idea.</P>

<P>As we conclude another round of the twice daily recitation of Tehilim 27 - <I>L'dovid Hashem Ori</I> -  at a time when our yom tov spirit is so dampened,  we probably identified with many of the sentiments expressed by Dovid <I>Hamelech</I> more so than other years. The pasuk that associates this perek with sukkos certainly expressed the prayer in all our hearts throughout the yomim tovim, "Indeed He will protect me in His [<I>Sukka</I>] shelter on the day of evil; He will shelter conceal me in the recesses of His tent, He will lift me up on a rock". </P>
<P>In fact in an altogether different context the Yalkut in Parshas Emor says that the <I>zechus</I> of the <I>mitzva</I> of <I>sukka</I> will bring us divine protection.  Why the <I>mitzva</I> of <I>sukka</I> more than any other <I>mitzva</I>?  Explains the K'sav Sofer that through the  <I>mitzva</I> of <I>sukka</I> one expresses one's <I>bitachon</I> in Hashem's protection, and one who is so  keenly aware of it and open to appreciating it,  will certainly merit it.   </P>
<P>At the same time our experiences this <I>Yom tov</I>, must strengthen one of the age-old difficulties in understanding the central request of this <I>perek</I>, "One thing I asked from Hashem and that I shall seek - that I dwell  in the House of Hashem all the days of my life, to behold the sweetness of Hashem and contemplate in His sanctuary." Should this really be the one request uppermost in Dovid <I>Hamelech's</I> mind - the leader of all Israel? Especially at times of war, would we not expect that the one responsible for the physical and spiritual welfare of our people, would plead with all his strength for our security, and wellbeing? Isn't yearning to be personally found <I>in Beis Hamikdosh</I> tantamount to neglecting his duties to the people to whom he was appointed?   </P>
<P>Explains the HaRav Chaim Friedlander in his widely acclaimed <I>sefer</I>, <I>Sifsei Chaim</I>, that certainly Dovid Hamelech's primary concern and focus was the responsibilities of his leadership, the security and spiritual and physical  prosperity of his people.  It is precisely for this that Dovid <I>Hamelech</I> is praying in his request to find himself in the House of Hashem. Indeed, Dovid <I>Hamelech</I> wants to be continuously aware of Hashem, and appreciative of His constant protection and guidance and is begging not only for physical sustenance but protection from the hubris that affects so many successful leaders as well.  That is the "<I>beis Hashem</I>" in which he wants to tRavel at all times, be it in on the battlefield or in the palace courts. </P>
<P>This interpretation sheds light on another very difficult passage in the <I>perek</I>, "Though an army would besiege me, my heart would not fear; though war would arise against me, in <B>this [<I>b'zos</I>]</B> I trust".  Exactly in what is Dovid <I>Hamelech</I> placing his trust?  Many of the <I>meforshim</I> have pondered this suggesting various references in the surrounding <I>pesukim</I>.  Perhaps we are to see "<B><I>bezos</B></I>" as referring to the entire sequence of <I>pesukim</I> that follow: "Indeed He will protect me in His [<I>Sukka</I>] shelter on the day of evil; He will shelter conceal me in the recesses of His tent, He will lift me up on a rock.  <B>Now</B> my head is raised above my enemies around me and I will slaughter offerings in His Tent, <B>accompanied by joyous song; I will sing praise to Hashem</B>."  Dovid <I>Hamelech</I> places his trust in the <I>zechus</I> that he will always see  himself in the "<I>beis Hashem</I>", so that every moment of salvation that he experiences will give him opportunity to express his recognition of Hashem's protective wings.  Similar to Yaakov <I>Aveinu</I> as he found himself in his most difficult time and defined for all time how we react <I>be'es tzoro</I> (Vayetze, 28:20-21) Dovid <I>Hamelech</I> promises that he will attribute any success to Hashem's mercy and love for him and <I>Klal Yisrael</I>.  </P>
<P>In the <I>zechus</I> of our observance of the <I>mitzva</I> of <I>sukka</I> and all that it entails may we be speedily be <I>zoche</I> to joyously express our gratitude for His protection during this <I>eis tzoro</I>.  </P>

<P>"<I>Dirshu Hashem be-himazo kerauhu bihiyato karov</I>". This <I>pasuk</I>, which plays such a central role in times of crisis and contemplation as the introduction to the <I>haftorah</I> on fast days, implores us to seek out Hashem and cultivate a more profound relationship with Him precisely when His Presence is near. While the gemara in Rosh Hashanah 18b interprets this as a reference <I>to asseret yemei teshuvah</I>, the midrash in Vayikra, as understood by Meiri (Hibbur ha-Teshuvah, p. 250), seems to characterize the entire month of Elul as "<I>bihiyoto karov</I>", an opportune time and propitious opportunity in which Hashem's presence is particularly accessible. It is on this basis that he reports the <I>geonic</I> view that one should say <I>selihot</I> every Monday and Thursday throughout the month. However, it is apparent from his formulation<I>- "kedai she-yikanes le-Rosh Hashanah be-taharat ha-lev</I>" - that Meiri apparently perceives the primary significance of Elul as a means of preparing for Rosh Hashanah in such a way as to ensure that one enters into Rosh Hashanah already in a state of purity with a clean slate so that he can better capitalize on the opportunities presented by that unique day. Thus, the exigency of <I>teshuvah</I> and <I>tefilah</I> during Elul constitutes nothing more than a lengthier preperation for the <I>Yomim Noraim</I>. From this perspective, there is no fundamental difference between the thirty-day period that precedes R. H. and those that introduce other <I>chagim</I>. </P>
<P>It is, however, conceivable that Elul represents "<I>bihiyoto karov</I>" in its own right, distinguishing it from other thirty-day preludes. Undoubtedly this would qualify it still further as the most effective vehicle through which to prepare for the <I>Yomim Noraim</I>. It would also accent that the <I>din</I> and <I>kapparah</I> generated by these transcendent days cannot take place in a vacuum, but constitute the culmination of a rigorous process of introspection and spiritual re-invention. </P>
<P>The Tur (no. 581) introduces the laws of R. H. by citing the Pirkei de- R. Eliezer's explanation of the origin of <I>shofar</I> on Rosh Hodesh and the month of Elul. It is reported that Moshe's ascension to the mountain to receive the second <I>Luchot</I> was marked by the blowing of the <I>shofar</I>, signifying the abandonment of idolatry which had doomed the first <I>Luchot</I>. We are informed that Hashem, Himself, was elevated by this <I>shofar</I> blast (based on Tehilim 47<I>- "alah Elokim be-teruah, Hashem be-kol shofar</I>"). The Tur proceeds to explain that the <I>minhag</I> to blow the <I>shofar</I> during the entire Elul in order to inspire <I>teshuvah</I> was based upon the verse in Amos (3:6), which establishes that the sound of the <I>shofar</I> has the capacity to inspire fear and awe. The Beit Yosef speculates why two distinct sources (the anniversary of Moshe's ascension and the verse in Amos) are required to ground the pracitice of <I>shofar</I> in Elul. A close reading of the text, however, may indicate that the Tur distinguishes between the <I>shofar</I> on Rosh Hashanah that commemorates Moshe's renewed mission and the verse in Amos that conveys the role of the <I>shofar</I> in inspiring <I>teshuvah</I>, serving as the foundation for the <I>minhag</I> during the entire month. [The Bach and Perishah seem to allude to this distinction, as well.] In light of this analysis, it is noteworthy that Hashem's remarkable reaction coincides with Moshe's ascension on Rosh <I>Chodesh</I> Elul. Indeed, the Bah argues that Hashem was twice elevated by means of <I>Kelal Yisrael's</I> initiative of <I>tekiat shofar</I>. He projects that while "<I>alah Elokim be-teruah</I>" refers to Hashem's response to the <I>shofar</I> of R. H., "<I>Hashem be-kol shofar</I>" occured on <I>Rosh Chodesh</I> Elul! </P>
<P>What emerges from these sources is that the events of <I>Rosh Chodesh</I> Elul are marked independently both with respect to Moshe's and <I>Kelal Yisrael's</I> initiative, as well as Hashem's reciprocal response! Moshe's <I>Rosh Chodesh</I> mission actually signified a renewed and changed relationship between Hashem and <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>. According to <I>Chazal</I>, the sin of the <I>egel</I> forever changed Jewish history and the nature of the relationship between Hashem and His people. Much evidence, including the <I>pesukim</I> that characterize the two sets of <I>luchot</I>, points to the fact that the renewed relationship would be one in which the nation would be required to invest more obvious effort and initiative and responsibility, and which would accent a more evidently reciprocal relationship, one in which man would also have greater input within prescribed limits. The explicit renunciation of idolatry and, symbolically, significant dimensions of their spiritual profile that characterized the pre-<I>egel</I> period, and Hashem's elevation by virtue of <I>Kelal Yisrael's</I> <I>shofar</I> initiative perhaps reflected the imminent change, capturing the essence of Moshe's renewed mission to reconstitute <I>Yahadut</I>. The momentous events of <I>Rosh Chodesh</I> Elul, then, constituting as they did a watershed in the reciprocal relationship between Hashem and <I>Kelal Yisael</I>, surely demand commemoration and generate anew yearly the obligation of contemplation and introspection. </P>
<P>Of course, Moshe's dramatic and ambitious mission, initiated on <I>Rosh Chodesh</I> Elul, encompassed that whole month and did not conclude until Yom Kippur. Notwithstanding the independent significance and theme of <I>Rosh Chodesh</I> Elul, the link to the <I>yomim noraim</I> is undeniable. Indeed, as alluded to previously, the themes represented by <I>Rosh Chodesh</I> Elul and by the <I>yomim noraim</I> are interconnected and mutually enhancing. </P>
<P>Consequently, one can and should relate to the entire month of Elul both as the aftermath and continuation of the <I>Rosh Chodesh</I> Elul initiative of old that produced the second and normative <I>luchot</I>, and as the necessary and conducive vehicle of preparation for the upcoming <I>yomim noraim</I>. Indeed, the reassessment of personal religious status generated by the anniversary of Moshe's mission to reinvent the relationship between <I>Kelal Yisrael</I> and Hashem establishes Elul as the ideal precursor to Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. </P>
<P>The Perishah speculates why <I>shofar</I> and not <I>divrei hitorerut</I> emerged as the visible symbol of Elul if preparation for the <I>yomim noraim</I> is the primary goal of this period. Perhaps, however, the motif of <I>Rosh Chodesh</I> Elul and the renewed reciprocal relationship that developed through the second <I>luchot</I> accounts for this phenomenon. It was precisely the dual impact and implication of that <I>kol shofar</I> on <I>Rosh Hodesh</I> that dramatically encapsulated this new spiritual foundation. </P>
<P>This idea can be highlighted by the fact that the Abudraham and others invoke "<I>Ani Le-dodi Ve-dodi Li,</I>" the <I>pasuk</I> that particularly underscores the close and reciprocal relationship with Hashem, as an acronym that conveys the special role of Elul. It is precisely a reassessment of that intimate relationship in its broadest strokes, (alongside an evaluation of individual actions and transgressions,) which characterizes the unique agenda of this month. Elul, in all of its dimensions- independent, preparatory and integrated- truly affords the opportunity of "<I>kerauhu bihiyoto karov</I>". </P>

		<title><![CDATA[<I>Matzah</I> - The Food of <I>Emunah</I>]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Hershel Schachter]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2000]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: pesach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>&#9;The Torah mentions several times that the purpose of all the miracles connected with <I>Yetziat Mitzrayim</I> was to demonstrate the existence of God, his power, and all the principles of our faith to the Jewish people. <I>Pesach</I> was designated as the <I>Yom Tov</I> of <I>Emunah</I> and the <I>matzah</I> is called, "the food of <I>emunah</I>", by the <I>Zohar. Shavuot</I> is the <I>Yom Tov</I> of receiving the Torah.</P>
<P>&#9;The "Kedushat Levi" points out the contrast between the two <I>Yomim Tovim</I>: 1. On <I>Pesach</I> we may not even possess any <I>chametz</I>, as opposed to <I>Shavuot </I>which is the one and only time in the year that a <I>korban</I> is brought from <I>chametz</I>, The Talmud considers the "<I>shtei halechem</I>" brought on <I>Shavuot</I> as a more elegant <I>korban</I> because of the fact that it consists of <I>chametz</I>. 2. The "<I>minchat haomer</I>" brought on <I>Pesach</I> is most unusual as it consists of <U>barley</U> grain, as opposed to almost all other <I>minachot</I>, including the "<I>shtei halechem</I>", which all come from wheat. Barley is usually used to feed the animals, as opposed to wheat, which is traditionally used for human consumption.</P>
<P>&#9;It may well be that these contrasts are due to the differences between the themes of the two <I>Yomim Tovim. Pesach</I> represents <I>emunah</I>, and regarding our understanding of God we must all have the attitude that, "if I really understood Him, I would be Him" (Kuzari). None of us can really understand any aspect of <I>Elokut</I>. Our understanding is compared to that of the animals (see <I>Tehillim</I> 73:22, and 42:2; Tanya Chapter 18). The "<I>omer</I>" <I>korban </I>on <I>Pesach</I> must consist of <I>maachal beheima</I> to emphasize this idea. No <I>chametz</I> is permitted at all since <I>matzah</I> represents elementary simplicity, while <I>chametz</I>  represents sophistication. On <I>Shavuot</I> when we celebrate Torah learning the "<I>shtei halechem</I>" <I>korban</I> should be <I>maachal adam</I> representing the idea that we were commanded to use our human intelligence to the best of our ability to delve into the study of the Torah. That <I>korban</I> must be made into <I>chametz</I>, representing the sophistication one should attain in Torah learning.</P>
<P>&#9;But, sophistication is not necessarily a trait that we want to develop in regards to <I>emunah</I>. The Chasid <I>Yavetz</I> (who was among the Jews who were expelled from Spain in 1492) wrote that he noticed the percentage of Jews who converted to Christianity to save  their lives was much higher among those who were philosophers than among the <I>peshutei haam</I> who adhered to an  <I>emunah peshutah</I>.</P>
<P>&#9;If one delves deeply into Torah learning his faith will neither remain simplistic nor primitive. Our tradition teaches us that the Torah is a description of <I>Elokut</I>. (This is the meaning of the concept of "<I>mashal hakadmoni</I>" See <I>Rashi</I> on <I>Shemot</I> 21:13.) Moshe <I>Rabbeinu</I> was the only prophet to whom the Torah was revealed, and this is referred to by the Torah as his, "having had a glimpse of the image of God." (<I>Bamidbar</I> 12:8). The best way to develop a love of God is by learning His Torah. (See <I>Rashi</I> on <I>Devarim</I> 6:6). By gaining Torah knowledge and developing a sophisticated approach to Torah, which is a description of <I>Elokut</I>, we come to understand Him better and our <I>emunah</I> becomes enhanced.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[Our Master and Our Beloved: A Dual Approach to <I>Avodat Hashem</I>]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Zvi Sobolofsky]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2000]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: shavuos]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[


<P>&#9;At the time of <I>yetziat mitzrayim</I>, <I>Benei Yisrael</I> entered into a dual relationship with <I>Hashem</I>. Simultaneously, <I>Benei</I> <I>Yisrael</I> became both <I>avdei Hashem</I> and His <I>kallah</I>. "<I>Ki li benei yisrael avadim</I> <I>avadei hem asher hotzeiti otam meeretz mitzrayim"</I> (<I>Vayikra</I> 25:55), and "<I>Zacharti lecha chessed neurayich ahavat kelulotayich</I>" (<I>Yirmiyahu</I> 2:2). Both of these aspects of our relationship with <I>Hashem</I> reached their fruition at <I>Matan</I> Torah. </P>
<P>&#9;In the introductory words to <I>Kabbalat haTorah</I>, the Jewish people are instructed to be an "<I>am segulah</I>." Rashi (<I>Shmot</I> 19:5) understands this to mean "<I>tehiyu kenuyim</I> <I>li</I>"- you should be acquired to me. The Beit Halevi, in his commentary on <I>chumash</I>, elaborates upon this explanation. It is only an <I>eved</I>, who literally sells himself to another, who can be possibly be obligated to fulfill every command of his master. It was only through becoming <I>avadim</I> <I>leHashem</I> that we became obligated to observe all of the <I>mitzvot</I>. </P>
<P>&#9;Yet, <I>Matan</I> Torah has another dimension. Rashi (<I>Shmot</I> 19:17) sees in the <I>Har</I> Sinai experience similarities to a wedding. Many customs we observe at a wedding are reminiscent of Sinai, such as lighting candles, symbolic of the flashes of lightening that accompanied <I>Matan</I> Torah. What is the significance of this dual relationship and how does it express itself practically in our <I>avodat Hashem</I>.</P>
<P>&#9;The Ramban (<I>Shmot</I> 20:8) observes that the division of <I>mitzvot</I> into positive and negative commandments reflects two aspects of <I>avodat Hashem</I>. Positive <I>mitzvot</I> stem from <I>avodat Hashem</I> a desire to act in a way that will bring you closer to your Beloved. Observance of prohibitions is a reflection of one's <I>yirat Hashem</I>; one refrains out of fear and awe from violating the word of one's Master. The true <I>eved Hashem</I> will never violate a mitzvah <I>lo taaseh</I> and a <I>yedid Hashem</I> - the beloved of <I>Hashem</I> will constantly search for positive ways to draw closer to his Beloved.</P>
<P>&#9;The Ramban sees these two parts of <I>avodat Hashem</I> in the dual obligations of <I>Shabbat</I>. <I>Chazal</I>, in <I>Massechet Brachot</I> 20b, interpret the phrase "<I>Zachor et yom</I> <I>hashabbat</I>" as referring to the prohibition of <I>melachah</I>. "<I>Zachor</I>" is an example of a "<I>mitzvat aseh</I>" which stems from <I>ahavat Hashem</I> whereas "<I>shamor</I>", a "<I>lo taaaseh</I>" has its roots in <I>yirat Hashem</I>. </P>
<P>&#9;Following the words of the Ramban we can reach a deeper understanding of what <I>Chazal</I> mean. "<I>Zachor veshamor bedibbur echad neemru</I>." Not only does this refer to these specific mitzvot which were recited simultaneously at <I>Har</I> Sinai, but applies to both aspects of <I>avodat hashem</I> that must always go hand in hand. One who perfects his <I>avodat</I> <I>Hashem</I> can potentially reach a feeling of closeness and comfort with <I>Hashem</I> in which he forgets that he is ultimately infinitesimal in relationship to his Creator.  Yet, one who strives for perfection in his <I>yirat Hashem</I> may do so at the expense of being able to relate to <I>Hashem</I> with a sense of love and friendship. This is why we are instructed in <I>Pirkei</I> <I>Avot</I> ( 1:3) to serve <I>Hashem</I> out of love yet simultaneously not to forget "<I>yehi moreh</I> <I>shamayim aleichem</I>." Even at a time of love one must be in awe of <I>Hashem</I>. </P>
<P>&#9;The perfection of these two aspects of <I>avodat Hashem- ahavah veyira, eved</I> <I>veyedid</I>, is our goal on Shavuot and throughout the year. May we always reach this perfect blend of "<I>Zachor veshamor bedibbur echad neemru</I>."</P>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>In <I>Massechet Erchin</I> 10b we are taught that we are obligated to say <I>hallel </I>on all <I>yomim tovim</I>, but on <I>Succos</I>, there is an additional unique requirement to say <I>hallel</I>; the recitation of <I>hallel</I> on <I>Succos</I> has a dual role in <I>halacha</I>. </P>
<P>There is a definite link between between the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>daled minim</I> and <I>kerias hallel</I>. The incorporation of shaking the <I>lulav</I> within the context of <I>hallel</I>  clearly demonstrates that there is a connection between these two <I>mitzvos. </I> </P>
<I><P>Chazal</I> teach us that there is another <I>mitzvah</I> which is performed together with the recitation of <I>hallel</I>. The <I>mishna</I> in <I>Masseches Pesachim</I> teaches us that in the time of the <I>Beis HaMikdash</I> the <I>korban pesach</I> was offered simultaneously with the singing of <I>hallel</I>. Why are the <I>mitzvos </I>of <I>daled minim </I> and <I>korban pesach </I> singled out as <I>mitzvos </I>to be performed in conjunction with <I>hallel</I>?</P>
<P>The <I>Gemara, </I>in <I>Masseches Megillah</I> , relates that at the time of the miracle of <I>Purim</I>, <I>Chazal</I>were unsure as to how to commemorate the event appropriately. They wanted to institute the reading of the <I>megillah</I> as an eternal commemoration of the miraculous events that had transpired, but were concerned with this being considered an "addition to the Torah." Ultimately, they delved into the Torah itself to find a source obligating the commemoration of a miracle. <I>Chazal</I> concluded that just as the Jewish people celebrated the culmination of <I>Yetzias Mitzrayim</I> by praising <I>Hashem</I> at <I>Keriat Yam Suf</I>  with the singing of <I>"Az Yashir</I>", so too the events of <I>Purim</I> should be celebrated by praising <I>Hashem</I>, the <I>Megillah</I> acting as the vehicle of praise. It is this requirement of praising <I>Hashem</I> following deliverance from slavery that obligates us to recite <I>hallel</I> as we offer the <I>korban pesach</I>- the <I>korban</I> that transformed us from being slaves to being free men. </P>
<I><P>Chazal </I>noted that there is a greater cause for celebration following the miracle of <I>Purim</I>: At <I>Keriat Yam Suf </I>it was freedom that was at stake, at <I>Purim</I> it was life itself that was threatened. They concluded that the occurrence of a  miracle requires us to respond by praising <I>Hashem</I>. A miracle that ensures our freedom warrants celebration, how much more so for one that saves our very lives. The obligation to celebrate our being saved from death is the root of our <I>hallel</I> as we take the <I>lulav</I> on <I>succos</I>. On <I>Rosh Hashana </I>and <I>Yom Kippur</I> we did not say <I>hallel. Chazal </I>explain that as we are being judged and our lives are hanging in the balance it is inappropriate to sing the words of <I>hallel.</I> Following <I>Yom Kippur</I>, when we believe that we have been sealed in the <I>sefer hachaim</I>, we have in been delivered from the brink of death. The <I>medrash</I> compares the Jew who shakes a <I>lulav</I> on <I>Succos</I> to the warrior returning home victorious waving his spear to indicate that he has returned safely. As we lift our <I>lulav</I> in celebration of the gift of life we were granted on <I>Yom Kippur</I>; our entire being bursts forth in song, praising <I>Hashem</I> who has delivered us from death to life.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[Praying for What?]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Benjamin Yudin]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2000]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: rh]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The Gra, in his introduction to the <I>tfilos</I> of Rosh Hashana, notes a powerful and fundamental idea. The <I>mishna</I> in Rosh Hashana (16a) teaches: </P>
<P>"At four times during the year the world is judged ... on Rosh Hashana all of mankind is judged individually, like young sheep who pass through a small opening in the coral." </P>
<P>The seriousness and scope of the judgement is underscored in the <I>Nesaneh Tokef</I> prayer, authored by Rav Amnon of Mayence, wherein we are reminded of the nature of this judgement: </P>
<P>"How many will die, how many will be born, who will be at rest, who will wander about, who will become poor and who will become wealthy." </P>
<P>One would have imagined that in response to such a reference to judgement, one would pray on Rosh Hashana to be pardoned and forgiven, for life for our children and sustenance. Moreover, at first glance the <I>amidah</I> of nineteen <I>brachos</I> that we recite daily would have been most appropriate for Rosh Hashana. The listing of thirteen requests, personal and communal, would precisely articulate the needs of all on Rosh Hashana. Indeed, having offered the specific personal and communal needs on Rosh Hashana, the Shemoneh Esray for the rest of the year could well have been, "Reign over the whole universe in your glory," the theme of all the prayers of Rosh Hashana.</P>
<P>The Rosh Hashana <I>machzor</I> therefore teaches us a very basic principle regarding prayer. As Rav Chaim Volozhiner in Nefesh HaChaim (2:11) teaches, the main thrust and component of all prayer is Hashem, His kingship, glory and honor in this world. The personal needs of man are inconsequential in contrast and hence omitted on Rosh Hashana. Moreover, even during the rest of the year, when we do articulate our needs, one learns from the Rosh Hashana liturgy, that the primary purpose of our asking for health, wealth and religious growth is to serve Hashem. We are to channel these bounties to His service. Only then can we be rewarded.</P>
<P>The Tiferes Yisroel notes that this concept is found in his commentary on the last <I>mishna</I> in the third chapter of Rosh Hashana. The Torah informs us (Shemos 17:11), "And it came to pass when Moshe raised his hand that Israel prevailed." The mishna asks, "Was it Moshe's hands that won or lost the battle against Amalek? Rather, the Torah teaches you: As long as Israel looked heavenly and subjected their heart to their Father in heaven they would prevail, but when they did not, they would fail." Similarly, Hashem instructs Moshe (Bamidbar 21:8): "Go make a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole, and whoever was bitten looked at it and lived." The mishna rules again that it was not the serpent that killed or gave life. Rather, when Israel looked heavenward, and subjugated their heart to their Father in heaven they were healed, but when they did not, they perished. The Tiferes Yisroel notes that we learn from the above that whether one is praying for success in a new venture such as the war against Amalek, or even a business venture, or whether one is praying to be spared from an impending tragedy such as in the case of the serpents, or sickness, man's prayer is only effective if the primary objective is to serve Hashem. Benei Yisroel's subjugating their hearts to Hashem enabled them to prevail.</P>
<P>In reality, <I>tefillas</I> Chana, which is the <I>haftorah</I> for the first day of Rosh Hashana, teaches us a great deal about prayer, and in particular, highlights the above concept. The gemara in Berachos teaches that the <I>mussaf amidah</I> on Rosh Hashana has nine <I>brachos</I> instead of ten because Chanah used Hashem's name nine times in her prayer. (Instead of the regular seven <I>brachos</I> of the shabbos or yom tov <I>amidah</I>, plus the three extra's- <I>malchuyos, shofaros</I>, and <I>zichronos</I>, we only have six plus three.) She prays for a son and is finally granted one. </P>
<P>The first chapter in Shmuel recounts how Chanah used to accompany her husban Elkanah annually when he went to Shiloh to pray. One would have imagined that once the child was born she would have been the first to go to Shiloh to say thank-you to Hashem. The previous Lubavitcher Rebbe zt"l notes that Chanah does not go, saying: "Until the child is weaned, then I shall bring him; my responsibility is to raise him to best serve Hashem." She asked for a child- <I>l'maancha</I>- for your sake, Hashem.</P>
<P>May we be privileged to have our <I>tefillos</I> answered, and to word them correctly. </P>

<P>Basing themselves on the famous statement of R. Yehuda who provided for us three mnemonic phrases for the Ten Plagues: <U>DTza"Ch</U> (for Dam (blood), <I>Tz'fardei'a</I> (frogs),<I> Kinnim </I>(lice)), <U>ADaSh</U>, <U>BACha"B</U>, many of the commentators on both the Torah and the Haggada note that the <I>Makkot</I> (plagues) fall into three repeating patterns of three. R. B'chaye (a student of Rashba), in his commentary to Parshas Bo, notes that before the first of each of the three sets (blood, wild animals, and hail), Moshe Rabbeinu warned Pharaoh that his obstinate refusal to allow the Jewish people to leave Mitzrayim would lead to a catastrophic <I>Makka</I>. This warning's location was at the Nile river (see Sh'mot 7:15, 8:16, 9:13). The second plague of each of the sets of three (frogs, pestilence, and locust, which begins our Parsha) was also preceded by a warning except that this took place in Pharaoh's palace. This is indicated by the statements of Hashem to <I>Moshe "Bo el Par'o</I>" -- "Come to Pharaoh" -- meaning come to his palace (see Sh'mot 7:26, 9:1, 10:1). The third plague of each set (lice, boils, darkness) was not preceded by any warning.</P>
<P>The reason that G-d chose this threefold approach was to demonstrate to Pharaoh the fallacy and folly of his reliance on these two locations. As the Haftora to last week's Parsha, Va'eira, indicates, the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt all claimed to be gods who created not only themselves but the Nile river as well (Ezekiel 29:3). Pharaoh thus staked his claim of divinity and god-like power on the great source of nourishment for Egypt which he maintained that he created. The Nile was therefore a most appropriate location to demonstrate to Pharaoh the utter falsity of his claim and that nothing and no one can prevent the Will of the true Creator of the entire universe, and certainly of Pharaoh and the Nile river, who desired to extract His people from Egypt, from coming to fruition.</P>
<P>However, the Nile was not the only source of Pharaoh's haughtiness. His enormous palace tended to by thousands of servants, where he basked in the glory of the monarchy, where leaders of vassal states offered him presents and homage, where his immense wealth was openly evident, where he felt totally in control, served as the second source for Pharaoh's arrogance. Therefore, the palace was equally suitable as a place of warning for the <I>Makkot</I>. Indeed, even after the warnings that took place at the Nile, we find that Pharaoh immediately enters his palace, which, R. B'chaye posits, he did in order to maintain some sense of power even when presented with imminent disaster.</P>
<P>The third of the plagues in each set was not preceded by any warning. Pharaoh's initial refusals to free his Jewish slaves earned him another plague without any chance for avoiding it.</P>
<P>R. B'chaye, as well as many others commentators, teach that the <I>Makkot</I> had a twofold purpose. One, "<I>l'ma'an shisi ososai eileh b'kirbo</I>" (Bo, 10:1) -- "in order that I place these signs amongst his (Pharaoh's) nation," was directed at Pharaoh and the Egyptian nation. They should become aware of the existence of the one, true G-d. The second purpose was, "<I>u'l'ma'an t'sapeir b'oznei bincha uven bincha eis asher his'alalti b'Mitzrayim</I>" -- "in order that you (the Jewish nation) tell your children and grandchildren that which I wrought in Mitzrayim," that the Jewish people, at the time of their formation as a people, should have a real, absolute, unquestionable experience of the existence, the ominpotence, and the omniscience of the One and Only G-d. This experience was culminated at the Revelation at <I>Har Sinai</I>. This knowledge was then to be faithfully transmitted from father to son, teacher to student and would serve as the bedrock of the faith, based on knowledge and personal experience, of the Jewish nation.</P>
<P>In light of the above, it is not surprising that many powerful lessons about our own lives and thoughts can be gleaned from Pharaoh's sources of arrogance which led to his refusal to submit to the Divine Will. The first was the Nile. Perhaps we can suggest that the Nile also represents Nature in general. Pharaoh, and Man in general, felt that he mastered the Nile, meaning that he mastered Nature. Professor Gerald Schroeder, in his book, <U>The Science of God</U>, quotes that after the "scientists" discovered that the sun, and indeed all stars, produced massive amounts of light and energy through the process of nuclear fusion, the "poets" felt that they did a disservice to humanity. Beforehand, the stars were mysterious, magical, miraculous, even signs of a Creator; now, they were nothing more than nuclear-fusion, energy generators. However, Professor Schroeder indicates that this logic is obviously fallacious. Man's understanding and explanation of Nature and its laws are merely an insight into the great wisdom of Nature's Creator and certainly should not serve as a source for leading Man away from his Creator. As Rav Dovid Hirsch, Shlita, noted in a lecture, "Mother Nature has a Father." And that Father is the <I>Borei Kol Ha'olamos</I>, the Eternal Creator. Man's exploration and amassment of knowledge of the laws of Nature, especially in the last century, are astounding and from the perspective of the previous millennia of scientific endeavor are beyond belief. Space exploration, decoding of genetics, Einstein's theories of Relativity are but a few of the immense insights into G-d's world that have been gleaned by the scientific community. This knowledge often does, as it did in Pharaoh's case, lead to atheism and agnosticism, ultimately caused by arrogance. Many think, either consciously or subconsciously, "we know the world; therefore we are the masters of the world." However, as pointed out above, this could not be further from true. The massive insights into the complexities of the elements of the universe, both human beings and inanimate matter should serve as the greatest boost to belief in the Creator. On the contrary, Adam HaRishon, and Man in general, is commanded "<I>V'Kivshu'a</I>" (B'raishis 1:28) -- conquer the world, study it, know it, master it, utilize its resources. But all for a purpose: to increase our awareness of the Creator and to harness and utilize its laws in His service. Pharaoh's ultimate declaration of "<I>Hashem HaTzaddik v'ani v"ami ha'r'shaim</I>" -- "G-d is the righteous One and I and my nation are wicked" -- speaks to all of us. The wonders of the world, both natural and supernatural, speak of the Creator. "<I>Hashamayim m'sap'rim k'vod Keil</I>" (Psalms 19:2) -- "The heavens declare the glory of G-d." (See, however, _The Lonely Man of Faith, by Rav Yosef Dov Haleivi Soloveitchik zt"l, that this "declaration" is insufficient. It must be coupled with Revelation, the Torah, and its observances, given to the Jewish nation.)</P>
<P>A similar thought can be developed concerning Pharaoh's second source of arrogance, his palace, which can be generalized to mean Man's wealth. This too can, although it should not and need not, distance Man from G-d. 
(For an exploration of this theme, see <a href="/torah/1999/moadim/rhab_succot.html">"Active Prayer"</a>
by this writer, in the archives of TorahWeb.) The gifts of scientific knowledge and wealth granted to G-d's creations, humanity, by Him should only be utilized to draw us nearer to Him.</P>

<P>&#9;"And G-d brought [all of the living creatures] to Man to see what he would call [them]; and all the animals that he called [with names] is his name (<I>B'raishit</I> 2:19)." With this passage, the Torah relates the episode of Adam naming the animals. What was the purpose of this procedure? Why didn't the same Creator who endowed Adam with knowledge and language skills also include a "database" of the names of the animals in his brain?</P>
<P>&#9;Furthermore, on the passage "let <U>us</U> make Man (1:26)," the Midrash quotes several positions as to whom the Creator was addressing with the word "us." Rashi quotes the opinion that He consulted with the angels before creating Man. Even though G-d did not need the angels' input and they did not assist in Man's creation, He nonetheless solicited their advice in order to teach us that a greater individual should always consult with people of lesser stature before embarking on major projects. However, the Midrash states another, enigmatic opinion that the subject of "us" is the six days of creation. How can we understand this cryptic passage?</P>
<P>&#9;The Malbim (R. Meir Leibush Malbim), in his commentary to our <I>Parasha</I>, gives a fascinating answer to both of these questions which provides for us a penetrating insight into the complex creature that is Man. Man's mission to elevate his soul-body partnership in the service of his Creator would require the marshalling of a diverse group of characteristics for different situations. The Man would require diligence, courage, kindness, compassion, quickness and a host of other qualities. The human being would also need a dose of cruelty, brazenness and other qualities which we would normally associate with evil to be utilized at the proper time in the service of G-d: cruelty for the destruction of the enemies of Israel (see Midrash Tanchuma <I>M'tsora</I> 1 and Kohelet 3:8) and brazenness to allow the believer in G-d to ignore the taunts and disdain of a non-believing world around him (see Ramo, Orach Chaim 1:1). The Creator's "partnership" with the other days of creation indicates that he placed within Man qualities of all of the elements of the universe in addition to the Divine soul which came directly from G-d. It is well known that diverse species of animals possess different instinctual traits which they utilize for survival; Man received a dose of <U>all of them</U>. Thus, Adam and his descendants would be a microcosm of all of creation. Indeed, in many Jewish philosophical works, Man is referred to as an "olam katan" -- a mini-world.</P>
<P>&#9;Hashem wished to inform the pinnacle of creation of the plethora of qualities that were implanted within him. Therefore, He told Adam to name the animals. Names in Hebrew, the Holy Tongue, the language with which the world was created (see Ramban, Exodus 30:13), represent the essence of that particular object. Thus, Adam when naming each creature analyzed its most salient feature and called it appropriately. Now, Adam, having been informed by Hashem that all of the qualities of all of the animals had been placed within him, was essentially discovering himself by scrutinizing the qualities of each animal. If, in the future, the human being would erroneously think that he did not have courage, he need only remind himself of the lion within him. If he would question his ability to soar to great heights of divine service, he would recall that he is also like the eagle.</P>
<P>&#9;The idea of gaining insight into our talents from the animal kingdom appears in several other places in the statements of <I>Chazal</I>. Yehuda ben Taima directs in Avot (5:20) that we should be as "bold as the leopard, light as the eagle, fast as the deer, and courageous as the lion to execute the will of your Father in Heaven." Perhaps this Tanna is not merely using members of the animal kingdom as similes for good qualities, but highlighting the fact that all of their traits were placed within man. Similarly, we read in Tractate <I>Eiruvin</I> (100b) that had the Torah not been given, we would have learned various good characteristics from different animals. If all of these animal-traits were placed in Man at the time of his creation, it is not surprising then that he should relearn them from the animals themselves.</P>
<P>&#9;Many often think that they are locked into patterns of behavior which began in youth and continue throughout their life. The insight to be gathered from the presence of all qualities in an individual, albeit in different doses, should inspire us to change for the better and harness all of these talents, some latent, some patent, in the service of our Creator.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>"Et Shabtotai tishmoru  u'mikdashi tira'u Ani Hashem"</I> -- "You shall keep my Sabbaths and fear my Temple; I am G-d" (Kedoshim 19:30).  Rashi, commenting on this <I>passuk</I>, quotes the Talmud (<I>Y'vamot</I> 6a) that the <I>Beit HaMikdash </I>may not be constructed on Shabbos (see Rashi at the beginning of Parshas VaYakhel where he records a similar <I>d'rasha</I> concerning the <I>Mishkan</I>).  The same <I>halacha </I>applies to Yom Tov (see <I>Sh'vuot </I>15b). <I> </I>Thematically, the prepatory activities to cause the <I>Shechina </I>to dwell among the <I>B'nai Yisrael</I> do not push aside the Shabbos, the testimony to the creation of the world.  However, the <I>'Avoda </I>(sacrificial order) in the <I>Beit HaMikdash </I>must be performed on Shabbos even if it involves violation of the laws of Shabbos.  R. Meir Simcha HaKohein of Dvinsk, in his commentary, Meshech Chochma, (Parshas VaYakhel) explains that whereas Shabbos serves as a testament to G-d as Creator, Mikdash, as the place of <I>hashra'at haShechina</I>,  and the <I>'Avoda</I> offered in its walls serve as a visual sign of G-d as the <I>Mashgiach al Hakol</I>, the One who is constantly  aware of and intervenes in the history of <I>B'nei Yisrael </I>and mankind in general. Since the second theme goes beyond the first, the <I>'Avoda</I> is therefore <I>doche </I>(pushes aside)<I> </I>Shabbos. A major theological plank of Judaism, as evidenced by <I>Y'tziat</I> <I>Mitzryaim -- </I>the Exodus from Egypt -- and the subsequent Revelation at <I>Har Sinai, </I>is that G-d is constantly involved in the world which He created.  This is in sharp contradistinction to the  philosophy of Deism,  held by many ancient as well as recent philosophers, that G-d created the world and then left it totally to mankind.  The first principle of faith delineated by Rambam in his introduction to <I>Perek Cheilek </I>in Tractate <I>Sanhedrin</I>, is that Hashem is not only the <I>Borai Olam</I> (Creator) but also the <I>Manhig</I> (Overseer).</P>

<P>&#9;This <I>halacha</I> that <I>binyan haMikdash </I>(Temple construction) is not <I>doche </I>Shabbos or Yom Tov seems to be contradicted by a G'mara in <I>Rosh Hashana</I> (30a).  There, the Talmud records  R. Yochanan ben Zakkai's enactment concerning the prohibition of <I>chadash</I>.  By Torah law, grain products whose stalks  took root in the ground after the second day of Pesach, may only be eaten after the  <I>Korban 'Omer</I> was offered on the subsequent year's second day of Pesach.   After the destruction of the second Temple, since the <I>'Omer</I> was no longer brought,  R. Yochanan b. Zakkai instituted that the grain from the new crop may not be consumed during the entire second day of Pesach.  Now, by Torah law, when there is no Temple, the grain may be consumed as of <B><U>dawn </B></U>of the second day (see discussion there that not all agree to this point). However, if, in the post-Temple era, people would become accustomed to eat the new grain from dawn, this might lead to a violation of the laws of <I>chadash</I>.  <I>M'haira yibane haMikdash </I>-- the Temple may speedily be rebuilt --  at which time the<I> Korban 'Omer</I> will  once again be brought, and people would erroneously think that they need not wait for its being offered on the Altar before eating <I>chadash</I>.  The G'mara questions this reasoning:  if it is built before the second day of Pesach, the <I>'Omer</I> would certainly be brought by noon (the <I>kohanim </I>would certainly not be lax about it), in which case there would only be a need to institute a prohibition in the post-Temple period against eating <I>chadash </I>until noon. To this, the G'mara concludes that it might be built late on the first day of Passover, and, due to the flurry of activity necessary on "opening day," the <I>'Omer</I> might not be brought until very late on the second day.  On this, Rashi questions how the <I>Beit haMikdash</I> could be rebuilt on Yom Tov. After all, as we discussed above, <I>binyan Beit haMikdash</I> is not <I>doche</I> Shabbos or Yom Tov.   Rashi answers by quoting the famous Midrash that the Third Temple will not be rebuilt by Man.  Rather, it has already been built in Heaven by G-d and will descend miraculously at the appointed time.  This miracle is not subject to the aforementioned rule!</P>

<P>&#9;However, this answer will not resolve this difficulty according to Rambam.  For Rambam in his <I>Hilchot Beit haBechira</I> (1:12)  records the law that the construction of the Temple does not override Yom Tov.  The Rambam is obviously recording these laws with reference to the building of  the Third Temple.  Furthermore, in Hilchot M'lachim (11:4), the Rambam writes that the Third <I>Beit haMikdash</I> will be rebuilt by the <I>Melech HaMashiach, </I>the Messiah.  The Rambam even indicates that this is one of the proofs to positively identify the <I>Mashiach </I>-- the one who gathers all the dispersed of Israel, wages war against the enemies of Israel, and rebuilds the Third Temple.  The Rambam then maintains that the Third <I>Beit haMikdash</I> will be built by Man and is therefore subject to the restriction against building on Yom Tov.  The above G'mara therefore remains difficult.</P>

<P>&#9;Perhaps we can suggest an answer based on an approach discussed by R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, ZT"L, the late Lubavitcher Rebbe. In Tractate <I>Sanhedrin</I> (98a) we learn that the <I>G'eula </I>(Redemption) and <I>Biat HaMashiach</I> (Coming of the Messiah) can take place in one of two ways depending on the deeds of K'lal Yisrael. If <I>lo zach</I>u, we do not truly merit the redemption, then the <I>G'eula </I>and <I>Biat HaMashiach</I> will occur at their predetermined time and will unfold in a natural way.  If Klal Yisrael merits, then the redemption will be hastened and will occur supernaturally.  Similary, R. Schneerson suggests, if we do not merit, then the <I>Beit haMikdash</I> will be rebuilt by Man as the Rambam indicates.  If we do merit, then the Temple will descend from Heaven as Rashi indicates.  We can develop this answer further to explain how the Rambam would resolve the difficult G'mara in Rosh Hashana. R. Yochanan b. Zakkai lived at the time of the destruction of the second Temple.  The G'mara in Sanhedrin (97a) indicates that the time in history that has been predesignated for <I>Biat Hamashiach</I> is during the last two thousand years of the existence of  the current world as we know it, from the years 4000 - 6000 in the Jewish calendar. R. Yochanan b. Zakkai lived before the year 4000.  Therefore, his concern that<I> "m'haira yibaneh haMikdash"</I> -- that the Temple would be built speedily -- would clearly have to be based on the merits of Klal Yisrael. This would lead to the supernatural <I>G'eula</I> which would include the Mikdash descending from Heaven.  As such there was a real concern that the Mikdash would be built on the first day of Pesach and therefore <I>chadash </I>had to be prohibited for the entire second day. </P>

<P>&#9;The various institutions that have been established by our Chachamim based on the principle of <I>"m'haira yibaneh haMikdash" </I>(see Encylopedia Talmudit, <I>"Beit haMikdash"</I>: <I>"m'haira yibaneh haMikdash"</I>), should serve to highlight to us the constant yearning that Klal Yisrael have had and must have for G<I>eula, Mashiach and binyan Bayit</I>. These themes fill our prayers especially on Shabbos and Yom Tov.    The Talmud in Shabbat teaches that one of the first questions that the soul is asked in heaven is <I>"tzipita li'shua?" </I>-- "did you anxiously await redemption?"  Part of the fundamental principle of belief in the coming of Mashiach as elaborated upon by the Rambam (<I>Hilchot M'lachim</I> 11:1) is not just <B><U>belief in</U> </B>but a <B><U>longing</B> <B>for</B></U> redemption.  Due to the many blessings that Hashem has bestowed on his people in all the lands of their dispersion, especially in our time, this longing is not innate and must be constantly developed.  Some recommend that minimally when we pray "Ki lishuat'cha kivinu kol hayom" -- "for we long for your salvation every day" -- in the15th blessing of Shemoneh 'Esrai, we should strive to feel immense longing for the redemption. In the merit of our longing for the <I>G'eula, </I>may we merit it speedily in our days!</P>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Yakov Haber]]></author>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: naso]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>&#9;<I>"V'nik'ta v'niz'r'a zara" -- </I>"and she shall be [found] innocent and [subsequently] have children (5:28)."<I>  </I>With these words, Hashem guarantees that a woman suspected of infidelity to her husband who is cleared of the charges through the test of the <I>mayim ham'ar'rim -- </I>the bitter waters -- will be blessed.  If previously barren, she will now have children; if in the past, she had severe labor pains, now the birth-process will be easier (Rashi quoting from Sota 26a).</P>

<P>&#9;Historically, at least one woman threatened to utilize the <I>sota</I> process in order to be the beneficiary of this divine promise.  The Talmud in B'rachot (31b) elaborates on part of Chana's famous prayer to <I>the Ribono Shel 'Olam</I> for children.  "Master of the Universe," she cried, "you created in my body organs designed both to give birth to children and to nourish them; surely you did not create them in vain?  If you do not grant me children, I will be forced to seclude myself with another man and go through the <I>sotah</I> process in order to force You to grant me children!"  The Sages of the Talmud derive that Chana spoke audaciously to Hashem from the phrase: "<I>Vatitpallel 'al Hashem</I>" -- "and [Chana] prayed to [literally: <B><U>on</B></U>] G-d. (Samuel I 1:10)" The usage of <B><I><U>'al</I></U> </B>(on) rather than the more familiar <B><I><U>'el</B></U> </I>(to) indicates that "<I>hiticha d'varim klapei ma'la</I>" -- she thrust words up to heaven.  Interestingly, though, Chana's prayer was answered immediately.  Why would Hashem reward a brazen request with a speedy reply?</P>

<P>&#9;Furthermore, we find that Moshe Rabbeinu is described by the Midrash (Yalkut Shimoni 797) as being "<I>maitiach dvarim klapei ma'la</I>."  In Parshat B'ha'alot'cha (11:2), after the episode of the <I>mit'on'nim </I>(complainers), the Torah relates the prayer of Moshe to stop the heavenly fire from consuming any more of B'nei Yisrael. "<I>Va'yitpallel Moshe <B><U>'el</B></U> Hashem</I>."  The Midrash comments that the word <B><I><U>'el</B></I></U> should be read as <B><I><U>'al</B></I></U> . This teaches us that Moshe "stuck words to heaven."  Rav C. Y. Goldwicht zt"l, the founding Rosh HaYeshiva of Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh, under whom I was privileged to study, noted that this Midrash seems to be illogical.  Why should we accuse Moshe of praying brazenly by making substitutions in the text, if the text itself does not require such a reading?</P>

<P>&#9;These questions lead us to a totally different understanding of the phrase "<I>maitiach dvarim klapei ma'la</I>."  According to Rav Goldwicht, this does not necessarily indicate <I>chutzpa</I>.  Rather, it refers to the highest level of prayer.  G-d, our Father, who greatly loves his beloved People, who are referred to as His children, is also compared to a loving Husband who wishes to shower His <I>kalla</I>, Knesset Yisrael with goodness always 
(see <a href="../moadim/rsob_shavuos.html">Our Master and Our Beloved: A Dual Approach to Avodat Hashem</a>,
by <a href="../../../mindex.htm#sobolofsky"> Rav Zvi Sobolofsky</a>).  However, in order to allow Man to better himself, He instituted a system of reward and punishment to motivate Man to strive for perfection.  Just as punishing a child causes the father suffering, so too the <I>Shekhina</I> "suffers" when limitless goodness cannot be granted to all of Bnei Yisrael (see, for example, B'rachot (3a) which records the <I>Shekhina's</I> "cry" over the destruction of the Temple and Sanhedrin (46a) concerning His "cry" over individual suffering). Of course, it should be noted, as the Rambam elaborates at length in Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah and in his Moreh Nevukhim, that human emotions do not apply to G-d, but nonetheless we use anthropomorphisms to describe the way in which G-d interacts with the world.  When someone suffers, the most basic form of prayer is to ask G-d to remove the pain because it causes him (the person) pain.  A higher level of prayer is to ask G-d to remove the trouble because that will remove the <I>"tsa'ar haShekhina</I>."  "<I>Maitiach dvarim klapei ma'la</I>" means that the <I>mispallel</I> focused on praying for the "<I>tsa'ar haShekhina</I>."  Chana's <I>tefilla</I> stressed the fact that Hashem's glory would increase if she were granted a child. Her current state of barrenness would cause a <I>chillul Hashem, </I>leading people to think that G-d's creations were not functional.  If she were granted a child, all of the observers would become more aware of the fact that nothing in Hashem's creation is in vain.  This would create a <I>kiddush hashem</I> -- a sanctification of the name of G-d.  Indeed, Chana promised to dedicate the child's entire life to divine service, and, sacrificing the natural desire of a mother to take part in every step of her son's development, put the child under Eili, the Kohen Gadol's tutelage when Shmuel was but a child.  This demonstrates the selfless nature of her request.  In light of this interpretation, the phrase "<B><U>'<I>al</B></U> Hashem</I>" does not mean <B><U>on</B></U> G-d, implying brazenness toward Hashem, but rather <B><U>for</U> </B>G-d, as she prayed in order to increase Divine Glory.</P>

<P>&#9;The same applies in the case of Moshe Rabbeinu's request.  The Talmud in Sota (14a) states that when Hashem refused Moshe entry into Eretz Yisrael he stated: "I know that you only want to enter in order to receive reward for fulfilling the <I>mitzvot ha't'luyot ba'aretz</I> (commandments dependent on the land); I will view it as if you kept them." Now, this is very troubling.  Antigonus from Socho teaches us in this week's Perek in Avot (1:3) that one should not serve G-d in order to receive reward.  Surely Moshe Rabbeinu, the Master of all Prophets, would not serve G-d in this manner.  Rather, Moshe Rabbeinu's goal in his prayer was to increase Divine happiness.  Since G-d created Man in order to receive everlasting divine pleasure (see Mesillat Yesharim (beginning)), the reward granted to Moshe for the additional <I>mitzvot</I> he would be able to fulfill would cause <I>nachat ruach</I> to Hashem.  From this, we can understand why the above-mentioned Midrash understood that Moshe was "<I>maitiach dvarim klapei ma'la</I>."  The entire nature of his request to enter the Holy Land was G-d oriented, not self-oriented.  Therefore, it is logical to assume that in the episode of the <I>mit'on'nim, </I>he prayed in a similar fashion.  (See Ruach Chayim (3:2) for an elaboration of this theme.)</P>

<P>&#9;Clearly, this level of prayer that is totally dedicated to G-d and not for our own desires is one that is not easily achieved.  However, we certainly can gather from the concept behind it the significance of selflessness.  Thinking of the needs of other people and not just our own is the first step we can take to achieve this lofty goal. Indeed, some interpret that the reason that the commandment of loving a fellow-Jew as yourself is such a central pillar of Judaism (see Rashi to Vayikra 19:18 from Sifrei quoting R. Akiva) is that through recognizing the needs of others, we arrive at a fuller, more heightened awareness that we are not the center of the world.  Ultimately, we become fully cognizant of the fact that G-d created the entire cosmos to allow Man to elevate his quintessential, spiritual nature by drawing nearer to Him, the true center of the universe.</P>

<P>"<I>R'ei 'anochi notein lifneichem hayom b'racha uk'lala</I>" - "Behold, I place before you today, blessing and curse." This prophetic statement by Moshe Rabbeinu, echoed practically verbatim in <I>Parshat Nitzavim</I> (30:15), encapsulates the fundamental principle of free choice. Hashem directs, commands, expects, but "I place before you" - the final decision is Man's alone as to which path he will choose. Indeed, this element of mankind is so central to creation that many commentaries (see Malbim for example) interpret the phrase "<I>tselem elokim</I>" -- "image of G-d" (B'raishit 1:27), in which Man was created, to mean that just as G-d has free choice, so does Man.</P>
<P>Philosophers of all religions throughout the ages have grappled with the apparent contradiction between "<I>b'chira</I>" - free choice, and "<I>y'di'a</I>" -- Divine Omniscience. If G-d knows what we will choose, then how are we free to choose it? Many approaches have been offered to resolve this contradiction including those clearly beyond the pale of normative Jewish thought. Here, we focus on the famous "non-answer" of the Rambam. In his <I>Hilchot T'shuva</I> (Laws of Repentance 5:5), in the midst of elaborating on the truth of the principle of free choice and its ramifications for human culpability and ability to repent, Rambam writes, in answer to this question:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Know that the answer to this question is immense...we have already explained in <I>Hilchot Y'sodei HaTorah </I>(Fundamentals of Torah) that the Holy One Blessed be He does not know [things] with a separate knowledge like people whose self and mind are separate. Rather, He, may His name be exalted, and His Knowledge are one. And the intelligence of Man cannot grasp this concept fully. Just as Man cannot comprehend the Truth of [the essence of] the Creator, ... so too, Man does not have the ability to grasp the Knowledge of the Creator."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Ra'avad immediately questions the sagacity of raising a difficult question without giving an understandable answer. However, it would appear that the Rambam's approach already appears in Tanach. The Rambam himself interprets the phrase in Isaiah (55:8), read on fast days, "<I>ki lo mach'sh'votai mach'sh'votaichem</I>" as "My (Divine) thinking is not similar to your (human) thinking." Malbim, in his commentary to a different passage in Isaiah (40:27-28), read on <I>Shabbat Nachamu</I>, explains that the Rambam's question and answer are already discussed by the prophet. Malbim interprets "<I>mei'Elokai mishpati ya'avor</I>" (40:27) - "and my judgment is removed from G-d" -- as the statement of one questioning how he can be accountable for his actions if G-d already knows what they will be. The prophet's answer is: "<I>ein cheiker l't'vunato</I>" (40:28) - "there is no [ability of] analysis of His Wisdom." </P>
<P>This contradiction is, according to many commentaries, alluded to in Pirkei 'Avot. R. Akiva states (3:15): "<I>Hakol tsafuy, v'har'shut n'tuna</I>" - "All is '<I>tsafuy</I>;' and permission is given." R. Ovadya miBartenura, in his first interpretation, translates "<I>tsafuy</I>" as "seen" indicating G-d's all-seeing "eye" referred to as well in Chapter 2 Mishna 1; no one can hide his actions from G-d. However, in his second interpretation, as well as in the commentary of Rambam and R. Yonah, "<I>tsafuy</I>" is translated as "foreseen." According to this reading, the Mishna is stating: "Even though everything is foreseen, permission is still granted to choose." Tosfot Yom Tov from Midrash Shmuel and Tiferet Yisrael both make the following piercing insight. The contradiction between free choice and foreknowledge only exists in the human mind, which recognizes a clearly defined and distinct past, present, and future. If Hashem knows the <U>future</U> already, then how can it play out according to human choice? However, past, present, and future are all functions of time. For Hashem, the Creator of time, past, present, and future collapse into one. When Hashem "sees" into the future, He does not witness an event that is yet to occur. He is able to witness the event <U>as it is occurring</U>. Now, clearly, if an observer would state that someone is currently engaging in a certain activity, no one would be troubled by any contradiction between the statement of the observer, and the free-choice of the actor. The same is true concerning the "sight" of G-d. He sees the <U>future</U> as the <U>present</U>. Midrash Shmuel adds that the Mishna alludes to this by using the word "<I>tsafuy</I>" which literally means "seen," rather than "<I>yadu'a</I>" - "known." "Seen" indicates observing the present. Thus, G-d's knowledge of the future is similar to our knowledge of the present. The above-mentioned commentaries suggest that this is the intention of the Rambam when he states that Hashem's knowledge -- which is not subject to time -- is fundamentally different from human knowledge - which is subject to time. The concept of a Being not subject to time and space seems very foreign to basic, human observation. Therefore the prophet declares: "<I>lo mach'sh'votai mach'sh'votaichem</I>" -- realize that G-d's knowledge is totally unlike your own.</P>
<P>Perhaps we can suggest that the <I>Borai 'Olam</I> placed a hint of this notion of being beyond time in the Creation itself. According to Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, an object tRaveling at the speed of light is not subject to Time or Dimension. Now, if scientists can theorize that a physical entity, but a mere creation of the Master Creator, enjoys the quality of timelessness, all the more so can we appreciate that the Creator Himself has this quality. (See the Hebrew publication <I>Nitzozot</I> (reprinted in <I>Counterpoint</I>) for a fascinating exposition on the parallelism between the qualities of light and spirituality.) It is not surprising then, that Hashem and his Torah are throughout <I>Tanach</I> compared to light (see for example Isaiah 2:5 and Psalms 27:1).</P>
<P>We live in an age where the popular, "politically-correct" notion is totally antithetical to the principle of free choice. Even certain psychological schools of thought negate the concept of free choice. Many would claim that a murderer is not culpable for his crime because of his upbringing. An individual living a deviant lifestyle is not responsible for his actions because "that's just the way he is." The Torah clearly indicates the falsehood of these claims. It teaches us unequivocally -- the choice is ours, and ours alone to make. For different people, some decisions might be more difficult than for other people, but the choice of actions remains ours always (see Rav Dessler in Michtav Me'Eliyahu (Vol. 1) for a crucial discourse on "The Point of Choice"). May we always strive to fulfill the directive of Moshe Rabbeinu: <I>"u'vacharta baChayim</I>!" (Nitzavim 30:19) - "Choose Life!"</P>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Yakov Haber]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2000]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: tetzav]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The primary focus of the first half of <I>Parshat Tetzave </I>is Hashem's commandment to fashion the <I>bigdei kehuna, </I>the clothes for both Aharon, the <I>kohein gadol, </I>the High Priest, and his children, the regular <I>kohanim.</I> Many of the commentators note significant messages that are conveyed by the structure and form of the various items of clothing.  The fact that the Torah, known for its terseness and brevity, repeats the design for these <I>b'gadim </I>in full in <I>Parshat P'kudei</I> would seem to verify this type of analysis.</P>
<P>Malbim notes the parallelism between physical garments which clothe the body and the physical body which clothes the soul.  Just as the body's contours can be detected via the clothing one wears, so too can the qualities or<I> middot</I> of the soul be seen via the actions of the <I>guf, </I>the body.  Indeed, the Hebrew words for clothing,<I> madim, </I>(see Vayikra 6:3) and for character traits, <I>middot,</I> (see <I>Avot </I>5:10) are etymologically related.  It is not surprising then, that the Talmud in <I>Arachin </I>(16a) states that each of the priestly garments atoned for a different evil characteristic.  Malbim elaborates on each of them in turn.  Here, we focus on only one of them.  The passage in <I>Arachin </I>statesthat the head-covering of the <I>kohanim</I> atoned for the sin of <I>gasut haruach,</I> haughtiness.  Malbim explains that the covering of the head is meant to instill within the wearer a sense of humility before his Creator. As the Talmud in <I>Shabbat </I>(156b)states: "cover your head, in order that the fear of heaven be upon you!" [This is one of the sources for wearing a yarmulka or kippa (see Shulchan Aruch O"C 2:6).]  Interestingly,according to many authorities, the <I>mitznefet, </I> the head-covering of the <I>kohein gadol</I>, was larger than the <I>migba'at,</I> the head-covering of the <I>kohein hedyot, </I>theregular <I>kohein.</I>  This demonstrates that the more exalted one's position, the greater the effort that must be exerted in order to maintain the quality of humility.  This is true concerning all characteristics in general, as the Talmud in <I>Sukka </I>(52a) teaches us: "Kol hagadol mei'chaveiro yitzro gadol heimenu" -- "He who is greater than his fellow, his evil inclination is greater."</P>
<P>It would appear that the need for a greater battle against haughtiness than against other evil qualities is not limited to the <I>kohein gadol.  </I>The Mishna in Avot (4:21) teaches that <I>ga'avah,</I> arrogance, is one of the three primary evil characteristics that lead Man to sin. "Hakin'a hata'avah v'hakavod motzi'in et ha'adam min ha'olam" --"Jealousy, desire, and the pursuit of glory remove one from the world (this world and the next)."   The Rambam (2:3), basing himself on another Mishna in Avot (4:4), writes that even though one should ordinarily aim to steer toward the "middle of the road" concerning most character traits, with reference to the trait of humility, one must pursue an extreme path. "M'od m'od hevei sh'fal ruach" -- "Be exceedingly humble."  The Rambam writes the same concerning the trait of anger.</P>
<P>This Halacha of  Rambam seems to contradict another one. In Chapter1 (Halachot 4-5), the Rambam does not seem to distinguish between the traits of anger and haughtiness and any of the others.  With regard to all of them, the Rambam writes, most people should strive to develop the medium stance for that trait. Perhaps we can suggest a resolution to the apparent contradiction  based on yet a third passage in the Rambam. (The main theme of this answer already appears in <I>Lechem Mishne</I>(1:5).) In Chapter 2 (Halacha 2), the Rambam writes that the "golden mean" is only for those who are not spiritually ill.  One who senses a weakness in a certain quality of his must pursue the opposite extreme for some time until one can be certain that a return to the "middle road" can be stable.  With regard to  the <I>middot </I>of haughtiness and anger, the drive to pursue them is so great such that we are all to be considered "ill" and therefore must be <U>extremely</U> humble and calm to avoid the pitfalls of  haughtiness and anger. In Chapter 1, the Rambam teaches that ideally, even regarding these two qualities, the "goldenmean" should be advocated.  In Chapter 2, the Rambam describes the reality of the human experience -- in order to assure avoidance of  haughtiness and anger we need to act with extreme modesty and with great equanimity.  Indeed, concerning Moshe Rabbeinu, the greatest leader of all time, Hashem testifies in his Torah, that he was "anav mikol ha'adam" --"more humble than any other human being."</P>
<P>Only one who is humble recognizes that any talents that he possesses are gifts from his Creator.  Only one without a trace of arrogance will utilize these gifts solely for the purpose of <I>Avodat Hashem</I>, the service of G-d. May we be <I>zoche</I> to attend meticulously to all of the details of the clothes of the soul, <I>middot tovot.</P></I>

<P>"And G-d saw that Leah was not loved greatly (see Ramban and Ralbag), and He opened her womb, and Rachel was barren (29:31)."  This passage's structure is not parallel. One would expect the <I>pasuk</I> to read "and G-d opened Leah's womb, and closed Rachel's." Furthermore, most women are able to conceive and bear children. One would therefore expect the following: "and Hashem allowed Leah to have children, and He closed Rachel's womb."
<P>Malbim, commenting on this passage, provides an answer that sheds light on a fascinating, often overlooked, aspect of prayer.  The Talmud in Yevamot (64a) comments on the reason that many of the <I>Avot</I> and <I>Imahot</I> were barren at first: "R. Yitzchak states: Hakadosh Baruch Hu (the Holy One) desires the prayer of the righteous."  Hence, according the the original plan, Leah too should have been temporarily barren.  But since Hashem wanted to increase the love between Ya'akov and Leah, he gave her children right away, and circumvented the "normal," patriarchical procedure. Rachel remained barren according to the original plan until she would pray to G-d. When she finally did, she was granted children (see 30:22).
<P>Perhaps we can gain a deeper insight into <I>t'fila</I> (prayer) upon further analysis of the idea of Hashem withholding children from the <I>Avot</I> and <I>Imahot</I> until they prayed.. <I>T'fila</I> -- in the words of Rav Soloveitchik zt"l -- is "Man's rendezvous with G-d." It is an end in and of itself.  By talking to G-d, Man develops his relationship with Him.  As such, even if there is no specific need about which to beseech the Creator, and even if the requests are not granted, it serves a lofty purpose.  Hence, <I>t'fila</I> is called <I>avodah sheb'laiv</I>, Divine service of the heart (see Mishna Avot (1:2) and commentaries there, Rambam <I>Hilchot T'fila</I> 1:1).   However, Man does not always turn to G-d unless there is a need.  Even with regard to those who do pray regularly, the concentration and fervor invested into the prayer is most definitely intensified by a specific need.  Indeed, according to both Rambam (<I>Hilchot Ta'aniyot</I> (1:1), and Ramban (Glosses to Seifer HaMitzvot (Mitzva 5)), there is a separate commandment to pray in a time of tragedy.  This distinct obligation highlights this aspect of prayer which stems from need.  Hence, Hashem will often temporarily withhold that which He wishes to bestow upon His creations, in order that the human being first turn to him in prayer. It is not surprising then, that our great <I>Avot</I> and <I>Imahot</I> were recipients of this aspect of Divine love.
<P>Many Jewish thinkers have asked a twofold question concerning the nature of prayer in general (see <I>N'tiv Bina</I> by Rav Y. Ya'acovson, Chapter 2): "If the supplicant deserves what he is asking for, then why need he beseech G-d for it?  If, on the other hand, he is not worthy of receiving his request, then how does prayer help?"  The approach of Malbim, based on the words of Chazal, provides a ready answer for the first half of the question.  Even if the person deserves a certain divine blessing, G-d waits for the lines of communication to be opened before granting the gift.
<P>A similar approach is offered by Rabbeinu B'chaye on last week's Parashat Toldot.  There we read: "And Yitzchak beseeched G-d opposite his wife, for she was barren (25:21)."  This passage, too, seems out of order.  In describing the sequence of events, a more logical order would have been: "And Rivka, the wife of Yitzchak was barren. [Therefore], Yitzchak prayed to G-d for her." This would indicate the proper sequence of cause and effect.  R. B'chaye resolves this difficulty based on the aforementioned concept.  G-d desired the prayers of Yitzchak and Rivka; this was the desired result. In order to bring about this goal, He caused Rivkah to be temporarily barren. With this explanation, the passage reads in a perfectly logical order.  The goal was Yitzchak's prayer. The means of achieving it was Rivkah's barrenness.
<P>Rav C. Y. Goldwicht zt"l, the founding Rosh HaYeshiva of Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh, used this concept to explain a cryptic comment of Rashi on the blessings of Yitzchak to Ya'akov. "<U>V'</U>yitein l'cha ha'Elokim" -- "<U>And</U> G-d should give you (27:28)."  Noting the extra "and," Rashi, quoting the Midrash, writes: "yitein v'yachzor v'yiten" -- "He should give <U>and</U> give again." The deeper meaning of this statement is that the greatest blessing that Yitzchak wished to give was the blessing of a constant relationship with G-d.  G-d should give, stop giving, wait for you to turn to him in prayer, and then give again.  This is in contrast to the curse of the Biblical snake, who was to "eat dirt forever (3:14)."  Now, how is this a curse?  Wouldn't the snake be guaranteed an eternal source of sustenance? Rather, G-d wished to banish the snake from His presence. This is similar to a father who, angered with his son,  gives him a $100,000 check and tells him: "Here, this will provide for you.  Now, leave my house and never come back to me again!"  To those whom G-d loves, He wishes to give a little at a time to ensure a mutual, lasting bond.   This is similar to a father who gives his child a weekly allowance in order that the child constantly return to him.
<P>This approach to prayer should serve to allow us to deal more effectively with adversity.  If we view the trials of life as demonstrations of Hashem's love for us, we can view them in a more positive light.   G-d may often just be waiting for us to turn to Him in prayer, and then He he will grant us His abundant blessings.

<I><P>"Kema'aseh Eretz Mitrayim asher yishavtem bo lo tha'asu..."</I> The prohibition against adopting the <I>"ma'aseh"</I>, the practices of the Egyptians (<I>Acharei Mos</I>, 18:3) refers according to many commentaries to the nature of their social interaction that we are supposed to study, learn to deplore, and distance ourselves from.  Rav Samson Raphael Hirsch explains that the word, <I>"ma'aseh" </I>in Torah indicates social conduct and ultimately "the attitude of a people towards justice and civic life".  (see also<I> Meor Vashemesh</I>, Rav Nison Alpert)  It is certainly reasonable that slave masters could start out as individuals whose entire world consisted of themselves and their needs.  Perhaps that is why we are reminded in that <I>pasuk </I>that we must not emulate the Egyptians "amongst whom we lived".  Apparently it is precisely because we have felt the awful sting of a society built on self focus that we should seek with great conviction to protect ourselves from the behaviors that could have contributed to the development of that culture. </P>
<P>The belief that our suffering at the hands of the Egyptians in fact began with behavioral and character flaws would help us understand a phrase that we have repeated many a time in the past few days.  Our departure from <I>Mitzrayim </I>is described in <I>Tehillim </I>as "<I>Beis Ya'akov Me'am lo'ez" - </I>"The house of Ya'akov [leaving] a people of strange language".  Why did <I>Dovid Hamelech</I> choose to describe our oppressors in such a non-descriptive term, a characteristic that could describe almost any nation?   Certainly he could have found some expression that would more surely convey the flavor of the host power throughout our years in exile.  </P>
<P>This question led the author of the <I>Torah Temima</I>, Rav Baruch Epstien, in his commentary to the <I>sidur</I>, <I>Baruch Sheomar</I>, to translate "<I>me'am loez</I> " in a novel way.  He suggests that the Egyptians are referred to as an evil-tongued nation, not a foreign-tongued nation; as perpetrators of <I>La'az</I> - <I>Loshan Horah</I>, not as simply speakers of another tongue.  <I>Dovid Hamelech </I>is identifying a tool used by the Egyptian leadership against us; one with which we have become all too familiar throughout our years of wandering.  One need only review the opening <I>parshiyos</I> of <I>Shemos,</I> where <I>Pharoh</I> accuses us of harboring unfaithfulness to the very land to whom we had brought the economic stability and prosperity that they were then enjoying.  According to the <I>Ramban </I>the <I>Mitzriyim </I>were in fact grateful to <I>Yosef</I>'s family and had no ill feelings for them.  <I>Pharoh </I>had to wear down those good feelings and convince his people that we were different; different enough to be disinterested in the survival of Egypt.  Once the seeds of disenfranchisement were sown, one could easily ask for a tax from those foreigners who were using native resources.  A few well placed words could feed into a society so wrapped up with itself that it was unable to integrate others and their needs, ultimately transforming them into treacherous taskmasters.      </P>
<P> That is why <I>Dovid Hamelech </I>refers to the House of <I>Ya'akov </I>being extricated from the evil tongued Egyptian society.  He comes to remind us that what may seem as a behavioral and moral flaw can eat away at the moral infrastructure of an entire people leaving them bereft of any compassion and standards by which to measure themselves.  We are reminded through this <I>Hallel</I> passage that the House of <I>Ya'akov</I>, the Jewish home was redeemed from a surrounding that looked upon it with disapproval and distaste.  Having lived through the results of that attitude, we are charged through this prohibition against adopting <I>"ma'aseh Eretz Mitzrayim" </I>and rather we are to use our insulated quarters to instill concern for others, a positive outlook and a focus far beyond oneself.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Uncannily timed to coincide with the June chants of "no more pencils - no more books" which resound throughout America, this week's <I>medrash</I> describes the Jews departing from <I>Har Sinai</I> as "as children happily bolting forth from school". Their eagerness to be free from the sobriety and responsibility which attended at <I>Har Sinai</I> apparently caused one of the great lapses of communal consciousness and public decorum of the desert generation. According to the Ramban's reading, their flight was born of the fear that should they remain, they might hear more laws, more restrictions, more uncompromising goals. Additionally Ramban suggests that they were duly punished and their otherwise immediate entry into <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> was delayed. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus the seemingly simple phrase, (10, 33) "And they tRaveled away from the Mountain of Hashem [on] a three day journey" is in fact a strong censure which, as Rashi explains, has to be set apart with bracket like inverted "<I>nuns</I>" from the ensuing stories of complaints and woe. How is this seen in the <I>pasuk</I>? Perhaps because of the striking contrast to a similar passage recording the Jews departure from the shores of <I>Yam Suf</I>. There we read, (Shemos 15,22) "And Moshe <U>caused </U>the Jews to tRavel..." prompting Rashi to comment that Moshe Rabeinu had to force the Jews to leave the booty of the <I>Yam Suf</I> behind them. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why did <I>Chazal</I> compare the singular generation of the desert - the "<I>dor de'ah</I>" - to school children? Were they not the ones who reached the <I>madrega</I> that earned them the unquestionable revelation of <I>Yam suf</I> and Sinai and the daily <I>mon</I> and guiding pillars of fire and clouds? Moreover, why should delaying entry into Israel be a suitable way of rebuking a generation that accepted its all-encompassing obligations with enviable dedication that left it totally overwhelmed?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HaRav Simcha Zisel Broide tz"l, the Rosh Yeshiva of Chevron is quoted as commenting that the <I>medrash</I> is pointing out that the Jews did not appreciate the sublime significance of the mountain of Sinai - that is the very physical Mount Sinai. I believe that the Chevron Rosh Yeshiva was suggesting the following interpretation of the analogy in the <I>medrash</I>. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The immature student flees the hallways of the yeshiva because he sees them as the place of ongoing demands, and relentless and inflexible adherence to institutionalized structure. Not so the mature or graduating student, who honestly acknowledges the skills and information he gained and the attitudes distilled in the very same study hall. For him, the desks, walls and floors will remind him of maturing experiences, though sometimes painful, and moments of great insight. The accomplished student will leave the <I>beis hamedrash</I> very slowly and his appreciation will bring him back frequently. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of a generation who spirited away from the mountain, who did not want to take note of every rock, nook and peak and associate it with the soulful changes that G-d's greatest revelation wrought, were not yet ready to fully value the Land of Israel. The fear that a generation may experience the great miracles of the conquest of Yericho and not see them as part of the very terrain of Israel delayed their entry. The privilege of inheriting <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>, it would seem, is contingent in part on our full appreciation of every aspect of the Land and its contribution to each generation of Jews who were privileged to walk through it or even yearn for it.</P>

<P>"How privileged you are to be chosen to serve the children of <I>Avrohom, Yitzchak</I> and <I>Ya'akov</I>, the people [that G-d has] described in such loving terms as as friends and brothers."  With this stirring call to his newly appointed aides, according to <I>Rashi</I>(1:15),  <I>Moshe </I>successfully enticed his newly appointed aides into service.  Ever since then, this sentiment has been and should be a source of pride and encouragement to all those entering <I>mileches hakodesh </I>- the holy work of Jewish communal service.  </P>
<P>It may even be that <I>Moshe </I>himself found great strength in this sense of privilege that he presented to his students, enough to compensate for the very aggRavation that brought about the new appointments. Indeed just a few <I>pesukim </I>earlier, <I>Moshe </I>poignantly beseeches(1:12), "How can I myself alone bear your care and your burden and your strife".  Here <I>Rashi </I>indicates that <I>Moshe </I>was gently referring to several of the sacrifices that public office demands of its occupants.  As a judge he was often bothered by the tenacity of Jewish litigants to never let go in court.  Second, he did not take kindly to the national pastime of watching his every move and then speculating about their meaning.  He was pained by the knowledge that people were unfairly and irreverently talking about his private affairs.  Finally, there were always his detractors who described him as scheming and plotting against the very individuals that in fact were often protected through <I>Moshe</I>'s passionate concern for every Jew. </P>
<P>It has often bothered me that if <I>Moshe </I>found these aspects of public service intolerable, why was he directed to solve it by inviting so many more into the very service that gave his so much grief. If <I>Moshe </I>found the scrutiny under which he was placed and the lack of privacy so upsetting, then why involve others?  It does not seem that increasing the echelons of leadership, and thus spreading the targets of people would make it any easier?</P>
<P>Among the many phrases that the saintly chief Rav, Rav Kook, gave the Jewish people one stands out in my mind and can give us insight here too as well.  He was known to have said and lived, "Those of absolute righteousness do not curse the wickedness [they witness], rather they add righteousness; they do not curse the heresy [they witness], rather they add faith; they do not curse the ignorance [they witness], rather they add wisdom."  Perhaps Moshe believed that these poor traits of Hashem's people could be eradicated, not by criticism but rather by increasing the number of teachers, and giving higher profile and greater responsible to those who were accomplished in their wisdom and behavior.  </P>
<P>We may now be able to appreciate the flow of ideas in the <I>haftoroh, chazon Yeshayahu </I>(1:21-31).  The litany of <I>Yeshayahu</I>'s criticism is nothing short of depressing, "How is the faithful city become a <I>zonah</I>.... now  [full of] murderers... your princes are rebellious and companions of  thieves... they don't judge the orphans and the cause of the widow does not reach them.   Therefore <I>Hashem </I>proclaims... I will restore your judges as at first, and your counselors as in earlier times and afterward you will be called the city of righteousness, a faithful city." Just as we expect <I>Hashem </I>to announce the futility of our very existence and threaten our destruction, the <I>navi </I>turns around, saying "therefore" G-d will restore us to our spiritual heights, all be it with pain and difficulty, but fully restored we will become. How? By adding, adding numbers and focus, through more counselors and more judges.</P>
<P>Perhaps here too <I>Hashem </I>is setting an agenda for us.  When confronted with baseness that defies all solutions, add more learning, insist on greater spirituality and growing gentility.</P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>It is becoming more and more common to speak of one's investment style, which is reflective of one's personality as much as it is of one's financial sophistication.  There are those who seek low risk opportunities and others who prefer the thrill of risky ventures with the lure of high returns.  However when it comes to Torah observance and the investment of efforts into our relationship with Hashem, Rashi in this week's <I>parsha</I> warns against selecting <I>mitzvos</I> based on an investment- return approach. </P>
<P>It seems to me that this is the point of the <I>Medrash Tanchuma</I> quoted by the opening Rashi in <I>Parshas Eikev</I>.   The promise of abundant prosperity described in the <I>parsha</I> is conditional, as explained in the first <I>pasuk</I>, on our Torah observance.  " It will be because - <I>eikev </I>- you will listen to these <I>mishpatim</I> [laws]<I> </I>and observe them, that Hashem will keep the <I>bris</I> with you that he swore to your fathers."  We have come to expect this type of conditional phrase to read, "it will be if  - <I>im </I>- you will listen" and apparently that is why Rashi reminds us that "<I>eikev</I>" can in the noun form refer to the heel.  The <I>medrash</I> thus freely renders the <I>pasuk</I> to say "If you will listen to the <I>mitzvos</I> of your heel", making the promised plenty of the <I>parsha</I> conditional on the careful observance of that which we often step over, or summarily dismiss because they are so easy. Almost all of the commentaries on Rashi struggle with Rashi's apparent question. After all, this usage of "<I>eikev </I>" is consistent with other places in <I>chumash</I> such as Breishis 26:5 or Bamidbar 14:24.</P>
<P>Yet the substance of the <I>medrash</I> needs to be studied. The Torah is concerned with the Jew who ignores the easy <I>mitzvos</I> that are not particularly challenging to one's passions or lifestyle and prefers the hard <I>mitzvos</I> that do bring difficulty or discomfort.  Obviously we should not be choosing amongst Hashem's <I>mitzvos</I> for that questions Hashem's authority and shows a lack of commitment to the wholesomeness of the system.  That notwithstanding, why is the <I>nisayon</I>-seeker singled out for censure and the one enjoying the easy road designated for grace and blessings?  Are we not taught at the beginning of Mesilas Yesharim that life is a series of <I>nisyonos</I> / challenges, that test character and raise it at every successfully negotiated hurdle? The ongoing test of wills to refrain from <I>loshon horo</I> and anger, to rise up early for <I>minyan</I> or a <I>seder</I>, or to restrict what one watches and be out of the loop as a result - is that not where genuine spiritual growth is found?  Affixing a <I>mezuzah</I> to one's home, wearing <I>tzitzis</I> in the winter or eating <I>seudah shlishis</I> in the summer - can those easy <I>mitzvos</I> really bring one closer to Hashem? </P>
<P>Perhaps the point of the medrash is to remind us that we grow intellectually and spiritually in different ways.  True, we improve through confrontation and distillation. However, we also mature through steady and gradual osmosis, naturally absorbing from our environs, and harmoniously incorporating life's lessons into the way we live.  Hashem in His kindness does not insist that we only raise ourselves through stubborn contrariness.  Rather by surrounding ourselves with easy <I>mitzvos</I>, making us continuously aware of Hashem's presence through <I>asher yotzor</I> and <I>tzitzis</I>, serving Him becomes natural. This is the pleasant way of Torah referred to by Dovid <I>Hamelech</I> - <I>derocheho darchei noam</I> - and one who comes to realize it gives expression to the love Hashem has for His children and the beauty of His Torah.  Surely the <I>kidush Hashem</I> that this lifestyle brings to life should earn the promise of prosperity that is described in the <I>parsha</I>.</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: mishpatim]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final parsha of Mishpatim returns to the narrative of <I>Matan Torah</I>, describing the preparation of an altar for numerous <I>korbonos</I>, the sprinkling of their blood upon the people and Moshe's ascent to the top of Sinai.  Whereas according to Ramban all of these events follow the revelation of the sixth of Sivan and Moshe's subsequent descent, Rashi interprets that they take place on the very same days which are so vividly and differently portrayed in parshas Yisro.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How intriguing it is to have two parshiyos focus separately on the selfsame episode, each one choosing details so different from each other that they convey vastly different impressions and overtones. The <I>Matan Torah</I> of Yisro welcomes the <I>shechinah</I> with supernatural thunder and lightning, and <I>shofar</I> sounds that increase in volume. The trembling mountain marks Hashem's presence as it sends up smoke like the smoke of a furnace. The people are prepared through abstinence and are severely cautioned to keep their distance. They are overwhelmed and left shaking, somewhat traumatized and ready to run.   Not so the <I>Matan Torah</I> of Mishpatim.  Here the people stand presumably quietly to be crowned by the light sprinkling of blood that marks the new covenant.  They have been engaged through Moshe's Torah instruction, busy building altars and carrying the blood of the <I>korbonos</I>, and organized around twelve tribal monuments. The depiction of a fiery quaking mountain lifted off its core surrounded by bolts of light, sound, and visible thunder is absent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why two different stories instead of one complete story line? Why are so many details suppressed seemingly in an effort to paint such distinct pictures?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the event that would model the experience of Torah study for all time has to include both the excitement associated with the high drama that Sinai was as well as the care and concern that assures that one will tend to the particular requirements sacrifices.  There are times that study must be charged by an exciting program and fuelled with a flamboyant teacher or charismatic colleagues.  However as any matter worthy of one's energies it will more often require the careful and even painstaking efforts allowing oneself to find one's way in the labyrinth of Torah and slowly amass knowledge even as one attempts to deepen one's understanding of all of Hashem's wisdom.   Certainly, we who have in these times come to appreciate the results of laborious and thorough research can well understand the humbling message of parshas Mishpatim.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus we return to the story of Sinai after learning in great detail about courts and torts, and concern for the poor and disadvantaged, covering the breath taking scope of Torah and with renewed appreciation of the care extended to those who are struggling.  More importantly, the experience of study modeled in Mishpatim and the one closer to the ongoing efforts we extend to be <I>kove'a itim la'torah</I> does not end with a shocked people on the run, rather it culminates with a people riveted on their vision of Hashem as a consuming fire which is visible to all.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"And a man found [Yosef] him and he was wandering in the field and the man asked him, 'what do you seek'(37:15)". At first glance this <I>pasuk</I> seems to add nothing to the narrative.  The details of Yosef's search for his brothers are all left to our imagination and are seemingly inconsequential bar this one unremarkable event that occurred to the wandering Yosef.  The fact that it is singled out signals to <I>Chazal</I> that even if the man appeared as a person, he was no less than the <I>maloch Gavriel</I> on a divine mission.  Indeed, the sale of Yosef would have never occurred if not for this one meeting. Perhaps Yosef would have continued to wander and returned home reporting the unsuccessful search for his brothers.  Thus this moment teaches us, as the <I>Ramban</I> explains, that <I>Hashem</I> was guiding all the events leading up to the sale of Yosef and that He wanted the Egyptian exile to unfold in this manner.  More importantly, it would be a source of instruction and strength for Yosef for years to come.  Throughout the many times that Yosef would feel desperate and forsaken by family and by <I>Hashem</I>, he would be able to look back at this moment and be reassured that <I>Hashem's</I> watchful eye was directing his life's course. It was these moments of clarity when <I>Hashem</I> allowed Himself to be revealed that illuminated moments of ambiguity and aloneness, which would have otherwise left room for doubts of <I>Hashem's</I> providence.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This life perspective quite possibly may have been part of the upbringing of Yosef. His father's fight with the maloch [angel], according to <I>Ramban</I>, occurred in order to shape the way that Yakov would view his upcoming meeting with Eisav, much as it should shape our understanding of the entire parsha as well. If not for the struggle with the <I>maloch</I> one could have easily thought that Eisav came with good intentions, never planning to engage Yaakov in battle. After all, when they meet, Eisav appears to be a benevolent brother having long buried his difficulties with a paranoid younger brother. In the midst of all of this uncertainty comes the fight with the <I>maloch</I>, the moment of clarity that teaches us the true intentions of Eisav and his four hundred men. Once again it is the moment of <I>Hashem's</I> revelation that interprets the series of events that are to follow.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This pattern of interplay between the <I>ness niglah</I> [revealed miracle] and the <I>ness nistar</I> [hidden miracle] is at the core of the celebration of Chanuka. Here too the war is the classic <I>ness nistar</I>, as one could have forever questioned Hashem's involvement in our military success. It should not surprise us that the Macabbeans were venerated for their battlefield skills and their cunning stratagems. "<I>Rabim beyad Meatim</I>" [many given into the hands of the few] could been attributed to the skills of dedicated Macabbeans.  However the seemingly unnecessary miracle of the oil was the <I>ness niglah</I> to show that all that transpired was miraculous even if slightly hidden.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the purpose of a <I>ness nistar</I> if one receives the <I>ness nigla</I> in a separate context? What are we to learn from the coupling of revelations rather than the more efficient single <I>ness nigle</I> necessary to address our needs? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems to me that the <I>ness nigle</I> reassures and directs us to carefully analyze all of life's events and actively discover <I>Hashem</I> within them.  As a result, we proceed to pierce the veil of nature and coincidence, earning the singular privilege of participating in the revealing of <I>Hashem</I> and making His presence all the more palpable for all.  </P>

		<title><![CDATA[The Relationship between Shabbat and the <i>Moadim</i>]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Michael Rosensweig]]></author>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: emor]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<I><P>"Eileh moadei Hashem asher tikrau otam mikraei kodesh eileh hem moadai. Sheshet yamim teiaseh melakahah ..."</I> The introductory pesukim of Parshat ha-Moadim, the section in parshat Emor that delineates the various festivals, are somewhat enigmatic. Rather than focus immediately on the cycle of holidays begining with Pesah, as we would have anticipated, the Torah instead begins with a brief discussion of Shabbat. While Shabbat is ocassionally depicted as a <I>moed</I>, and <I>chagim</I> are sometimes identified as Shabbat (Rashi, Bezah 2b, Pesahim 46b, Shavuot 15b; Seforno Vayikra 19:30), the Torah's choice is certainly an intriguing one. Moreover, upon concluding its remarks regarding Shabbat, the Torah then follows with another brief introduction of the classical <I>moadim</I>-"<I>Eileh Moadei Hashem mikraei kodesh ashe tikrau otam be-moadam"</I>. Why is it necessary to reintroduce the <I>moadim</I> if, indeed, Shabbat is the first of the <I>moadim</I>, as the initial formulation implies? </P>
<P>Rashi and Ramban do address the link between Shabbat and the <I>moadim</I> implied in this <I>parshah</I>. Rashi ( Vayikra 23:3) underscores the common bond. He derives from this connection that one who desecrates <I>yom tov</I> is equivalent to one who violates the Shabbat. Ramban (23:2) focuses on the contrast between Shabbat and <I>moed</I>. He projects that by accenting Shabbat's absolute prohibition of <I>melakah</I>, the Torah intends to preclude the potential misconception that <I>heter okhel nefesh</I> would extend to a <I>moed</I> that coincides with Shabbat. Notwithstanding these important insights, the Torah's initial emphasis of Shabbat in this context and the impression of a false start that follows remains puzzling. </P>
<P>Further scrutiny of this section reveals another intriguing facet of the Torah's presentation that may shed light on the previous difficulty. Although the concept and <I>halakhot</I> of Shabbat appear previously in numerous contexts (Bereshit 2:1-3; Shemot 15:22-28; 20:8-12; 23:12; 31:12-19;35:1-3), it is only in <I>Parshat ha-Moadim</I> that Shabbat is defined by use of the term <I>"mikra kodesh"!</I> Why does the Torah wait until <I>Emor</I> to make this connection? </P>
<P>The fact is that this term, prominent and pervasive throughout the <I>parshah</I>, constitutes the common denominator of all the various <I>chagim</I>, as they are developed in <I>Emor</I>. Furthermore, it is this term which signifies in <I>Parshat ha-Moadim </I>(with the one prominent exception of Yom Kippur) both the prohibition of <I>melakah</I>, as well as the positive obligation to express sanctity by means of public prayer, <I>keriat ha-Torah</I>, fine clothing, and other such manifestations (Rashi 23:27 ; Ramban 23:2). It is striking that one expression would convey both <I>issurim</I> and <I>kiyumim</I> elements that characterize the <I>halakhic</I> concept of <I>kedushat ha-yom</I> (sanctity of the day). In the weekly <I>kidush</I>, Shabbat is defined as <I>"tehilah le-mikraei kodesh".</I> </P>
<P>It appears that the Torah relates to Shabbat on two dimensions. Until <I>Parshat Emor</I>, Shabbat is formulated in its own terms. Its primary theme is that <I>of issur melakahah</I>, as an acknowledgement and commemoration of the act of Creation<I>-"ki bo shavat mi-kol melakhto asher bara Elokim la-asot"</I> (Bereshit 2:3). For this reason, one who intentionally desecrates Shabbat by engaging in <I>melakahah</I> is deemed to be a heretic, as his actions are tantamount to a denial of Divine creation (See Rashi, Hulin 5a). However, Shabbat's status transcends this theme. As the "first" day invested with sanctity, it also became the model for other days of <I>kedushah</I>. Undoubtedly, this is also due to its own transcendent impact and stature. Indeed, the Ramban (Shemot 12:2; Derashah le-Rosh ha-Shanah) develops the idea rooted in the Talmud (Bezah 16a) that the entire week revolves around Shabbat. This, he argues, is reflected by the fact that the days are defined by their proximity to Shabbat rather than by formal names. One could not envision a day of sanctity without invoking the Shabbat paradigm. </P>
<I><P>Parshat Emor</I> introduces this second motif of Shabbat. Thus, the theme <I>of "mikra kodesh"</I>, which captures the general motif of <I>kedushat ha-yom</I> whose paradigm is Shabbat, is first associated with Shabbat specifically in this context. It is unsurprising that this term encompasses a comprehensive agenda that includes both <I>issurim</I> and <I>kiyumim</I>, as both flow from an integrated broad concept of <I>kedushat ha-yom</I> modeled after the total experience of Shabbat. For this reason, the Torah in <I>parshat Emor</I> appropriately introduces all moadim by first invoking Shabbat qua "<I>mikra kodesh</I>", despite the fact that there are important elements that differentiate Shabbat from the moadim. Having provided the Shabbat background and basis for <I>kedushat ha-zeman</I>, the Torah then proceeds to enumerate the actual <I>chagim</I>. The Torah reintroduces the <I>moadim</I> because while Shabbat constitutes the foundation for the <I>chagim</I> it is not actually a <I>moed</I>. The relationship between Shabbat and <I>Moed</I> emerges as a complex one. </P>
<P>It is possible that the two themes of Shabbat are manifest in the very prohibition of <I>melakhah</I> itself. While the <I>mishnah</I> (Shabbat 73a) lists 39 categories of prohibited <I>melakhah</I>, it is striking that the Torah broadly formulates the prohibition simply as "<I>lo taaseh melakhah</I>"(Shemot 20:10). There are apparently contrary indications whether the <I>halakhah</I> recognizes 39 distinct <I>issurim</I> (<I>shemot issur</I>), or simply 39 specific applications of one general <I>issur</I>. [See, for example, Shabbat 70a re<I>. hiluk melakhah</I>; Rashi Shabbat 72b s.v. <I>helev ve-dam</I> , Sanhedrin 62a s.v.<I>helev</I>.] Indeed, Rambam's son, R. Avraham, was queried why his father did not list 39 distinct prohibitions in his count of 613 <I>mizvot</I>. </P>
<P>Conceivably, <I>issur melakah</I> entails two distinct themes corresponding to the two dimensions that Shabbat represents. Each <I>melakhah</I> independently undermines and desecrates the theme of Shabbat as a specific commemoration of the cessation of "<I>melakhah</I>" at the culmination of the Creation. At the same time, as an integrated day of <I>kedushah</I> dedicated to man's spiritual obligations and aspirations, Shabbat is repeatedly violated by any act that generally falls under the rubric of <I>melakah</I>. Thus, the prohibition is comprised of both 1 and 39 components. </P>
<P>While <I>issur melakhah</I> as a specific theme does not extend to the <I>moadim</I> (with the possible exception of <I>Yom Kippur</I>, for other reasons), the paradigm of Shabbat as a <I>yom kodesh</I>, which includes at least a general prohibition against engaging in all forms of <I>melakhah</I>, is certainly relevant. Thus, "<I>mikra kodesh</I>", conveying this general theme of <I>kedushat ha-yom</I>, is consistently linked throughout <I>Emor</I> to <I>"kol melekhet avodah lo tasu</I>" (with the previously noted exception of <I>Yom Kippur</I>). The gemara (<I>Makkot</I> 21b) notes that while one brings multiple <I>korbanot</I> for violating distinct <I>melakhot</I> on Shabbat, one does not receive multiple <I>malkot</I> for distinct transgressions on <I>Yom Tov</I>. Perhaps this important difference reflects that only the general prohibition based upon the paradigm motif of Shabbat applies to the <I>moadim</I>. [On the possible connection to <I>heter okhel nefesh</I> and other <I>halakhic</I> issues, see the author's article in Beit Yizhak, no. 23 (1991), 105-126.] </P>
<P>Ultimately, the association between Shabbat and <I>Moadim</I>, conveyed in the intriguing opening of <I>parshat ha-Moadim</I>, also links the initial and universal act of <I>Hashem's</I> Creation with other crucial events, <I>halakhic</I> motifs, and manifestations of His Providence, including <I>yeziat mizrayim</I>. The fact that Shabbat, set from the beginning of time (reflected in the formula of "<I>mekadesh ha-Shabbat</I>"), is interconnected to the <I>moadim</I> whose status is determined by <I>kelal yisrael's</I> calendar-setting prerogative (reflected in the formula of "<I>mekadesh yisrael ve-hazemanim</I>"- Bezah 17a) is surely significant as well. The compelling link between all of the special days enumerated in <I>Emor</I> and Shabbat is mutually enhancing despite and because of the different emphases associated with each <I>kedushat ha-yom</I> that find expression precisely in <I>parshat ha-Moadim</I>.

		<title><![CDATA[<I>Shevah Mizvot Benei Noah</I> vs. <I>Brit Milah</I>]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Michael Rosensweig]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2000]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: noach2000]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The Talmud (Sanhedrin 56-59) defines the universal obligations and prohibitions that devolve upon all men as "<I>sheva mizvot benei Noah</I>". Non-Jews, who must comply with these norms are designated simply as "<I>benei Noah</I>". An examination of the history of this basic code , however, reveals that only the seventh, <I>ever min ha-chai</I> (Bereshit 9:4), is actually associated with Noah; the first six commandments were addressed to Adam (Bereshit 2:16...Sanhedrin 56a ). The Rambam finds it necessary to formulate this history of religious obligation in <I>Hilkhot Melakhim</I> (9:1). </P>
<P>If six/sevenths of the themes that constitute the foundation for universal conduct predate him, why is the total corpus identified with the personality of Noah? Does the fact that his contribution completes the list, or that his survival ensured the continuity of humankind sufficiently account for this phenomenon? Moreover, one could certainly argue that <I>ever min ha-chai</I> represents a narrower and less fundamental principle relative to the other components-idolatry, murder, theft, etc.- that were initially addressed to Adam. It seems ironic that specifically this norm would link the entire list to Noah. </P>
<P>Upon further reflection, however, it appears that <I>ever min ha-chai</I> and the personality of Noah uniquely characterize the nature of <I>sheva mizvot benei</I> Noah, particularly as contrasted with the ambitious program of <I>Taryag mizvot</I>. The prohibition of <I>Ever min ha-chai</I> emerges in the context of a major transition allowing for the consumption of meat in the aftermath of the <I>mabul</I>. While some <I>mefarshim</I> view this allowance as a natural outgrowth of the changed relationship between man and animal resulting from the <I>tevah</I> experience, others perceive it as a concession to a lower minimum standard of spirituality demanded from man, notwithstanding his continued capacity for occasional greatness. This harsh reassessment of man's spiritual profile reflected in his level of obligation came about not only because of the absolute spiritual breakdown that led to "<I>keitz kol basar ba lefanai</I>", but perhaps also because even the lone deserving survivor, Noah, proved only to be relatively righteous, a "<I>zadik tamim bedorotav</I>". </P>
<P>Elsewhere (<A href="http://www.torahweb.org/torah/1999/parsha/rros_noach.html">TorahWeb.org, Parshat Noah, 5760</a>), we have suggested that Noah was the quintessential survivor, who was able to achieve the transition to a new world, but was incapable of seizing the opportunity to spiritually refashion that world . Even after the remarkable experience of the <I>tevah</I>, Noah remained "<I>mi-ketanei emunah</I>". It took some coaxing to lure him from the safe if uncomfortable environment of the <I>tevah</I> to the challenge of a new world. Finally, it was necessary to command him- "<I>zeh min ha-tevah</I>" (Bereshit 8:16), "<I>hayzeh itakh</I>" (8:17, and Rashi). Even as Hashem accepts his <I>korban-"va-yarach Hashem et rei-ach ha-nichoach</I>"- and resolves never again to destroy mankind, He affirms His reassessment of man's spiritual nature- "<I>ki yezer lev ha-adam ra mi-neuRav</I>" (8:21)! It is precisely at this juncture that Hashem permits the eating of meat followed immediately by the prohibition of <I>ever min ha-chai</I>, which notably seems to be formulated as a caveat to the original concession- "<I>akh basar be-nafsho damo lo tokhelu</I>"(9:3,4). Within this framework, the Torah finds it necessary to reiterate the prohibition against murder. The Ramban (9:5 )explains that the implications of this transition to a meat-eating society required a reaffirmation of man's centrality vis-a-vis the animal kingdom, as well as a clear statement about the sanctity of human life as it relates to human interaction. The Torah even feels compelled to reestablish the most basic principle articulated at Adam's creation- "<I>ki be-zelem elokim asah et ha-adam</I>"(9:6). </P>
<P>All seven of the "noahide" commandments are appropriately associated with Noah. In many respects, the <I>mabul</I> destroyed not only the world's population, but the prevailing world-order. The obligations addressed to Adam achieved continuity only because they were also binding upon Noah in the aftermath of the <I>mabul</I>, notwithstanding Hashem's reassessment and reformulation of the world's foundation. Moreover, <I>ever min ha-chai</I>, precisely because it emerges in the context of a clear and dramatic concession to man's propensity for spiritual mediocrity, conveys a basic truth about the scope and nature of "noahide" obligation that applies to all components of that code. The obligations of a <I>ben noah</I> are designed to promote basic spiritual survival and social continuity; they are not an effective prescription for spiritual excellence. Noah, who exemplified these very characteristics, is, indeed, the ideal exemplar of this system. The contrast to <I>Taryag Mizvot</I>, a system in which every aspect of life is suffused with religious meaning and opportunity, is manifest. </P>
<P>Hazal were intrigued about the relationship between Noah and Avraham. It is interesting that Avraham is also associated with a particular mizvah, <I>milah</I>. Rambam continues his history of religious observance in <I>Hilkhot Melakhim</I> (9:1) by noting this fact. Just as <I>ever min ha-chai</I> reflects Noah's contribution to religious life, <I>milah</I> typifies Avraham's and <I>Yahadut's</I> (Judaism's) unique perspective. This ambitious dialectical <I>mizvah</I> which highlights both man's aspiration to perfection, as well as his capacity and desire for self-sacrifice in order to attain spiritual goals (See Shabbat 106a; Sefer Hakhinukh; Moreh Nevukhim etc.), emerges as the appropriate symbol of <I>kedushat yisrael</I>. The midrash (Mishpatim Rabbah 30:9) records that when Akilas was considering converting to <I>Yahadut</I>, the king attempted to dissuade him, arguing that one could achieve the benefits of <I>Yahadut</I> without its burdens simply by studying Jewish texts and teachings. Akilas responded powerfully that one cannot effectively partake of the Jewish experience without a full commitment to the total system, particularly as represented by <I>bris milah</I>. Notwithstanding the critical role of Noah and the central importance of the system of<I> shevah mizvot benei Noah</I>, it is <I>brit milah</I> that is truly the foundation for the spiritual excellence epitomized by Avraham Avinu. </P>

<P>The puzzling episode of the <I>meraglim</I>, the centerpiece of Parshat Shelah, presents us with numerous difficulties. While there are some indications that the <I>nesiim</I> were perceived even on the eve of their journey as leaders of great stature and sincerity involved in a legitimate undertaking, there is equally strong evidence that their mission was problematic and ill-fated from the outset due principally to improper motivation and flaws of character and leadership. </P>
<P>On the one hand, <I>Hazal</I> focus attention on Moshe's role in apparently endorsing this mission. The Ramban (<I>Bamidbar</I> 13:2) suggests that its purpose was simply strategic, to determine the best method of conquest, and that the theme of "<I>ein somekhin al ha-ness</I>" constitutes ample justification. Indeed, R. Behai, following Ramban's lead, introduces the entire <I>parshah</I> by citing the verse in Mishlei (21:31)-"<I>soos mukhan le-yom milhamah, ve-la-Hashem ha-teshuah</I>" -, which he develops as a foundation for the ideal combination of human effort (<I>hishtadlut</I>) coupled with faith (<I>bitahon</I>). The <I>midrash</I> (Bamidbar 13:3) emphasizes that the participants at this juncture were still men of great piety and spirituality. The Ramban (13;4. Compare to Neziv ad. loc.) points out that the <I>nesiim</I> are specifically listed in this context in order of their spiritual stature. </P>
<P>At the same time, <I>Hazal</I> also note that the phrase "<I>shlah lekhah</I>" implies that <I>Hashem</I> disapproved of this course from the beginning, as it was evidently inherently flawed. The Talmud (Sotah 34b) perceives character deficiencies in the individual <I>nesiim</I> reflected in their various names. The fact that Moshe Rabbenu felt the need to reinforce Yehoshua's resolve by changing his name (Bamidbar 13:16; Sotah 34b), specifically encouraging him to resist the potential influence of his fellow <I>meraglim</I>, and the fact that Kalev, according to <I>Hazal</I> (Bamidbar 13:22; Sotah 34b), tRaveled to Hevron to seek his own spiritual reinforcement long before any negative reports had been conveyed support the perspective that this enterprise was extremely problematic already in its earliest stages. While Rashi (Bamidbar 13:3) notes that these were spiritual leaders of the highest magnitude, he also records in another context (Bamidbar 13: 26) that their attitude was problematic from the outset! </P>
<P>The difficulties engendered by the reading of this parshah are not limited to the apparently conflicting evidence regarding the initial status of the meraglim's mission. The Ramban notes (13:2, 27, 32) that it is difficult to characterize the initial report of the <I>meraglim</I> <I>as "dibat ha-aretz</I>" as they were accurately reporting what they had experienced and one would not expect them to falsify information. The Torah's response to their explicit transgression also requires clarification. While their one-sided presentation and even falsefications were inexcuasable and had devastating consequences, do they justify the charge of an implicit rebellion and blasphemy against Hashem (Bamidbar 14:6, 9, 11)? </P>
<P>The conflicting evidence about the initial stature of the <I>nesiim</I> and the inherent viability of their mission reflects the complex challenge that <I>Kelal Yisrael</I> faced at this juncture. The Neziv (13:2) develops an interesting perspective regarding this mission. He speculates why it is that spies were not sent already when the nation encamped at Horev. He argues that at Horev the nation had resolved to establish their religious identity and to approach their future based on the charismatic and miraculous relationship with Hashem that prevailed at <I>mattan Torah</I>, which precluded the need for such a mission. After several more journeys (<I>masaot</I>) in which it became self-evident that they could not sustain the spiritual intensity of such a relationship, <I>Kelal Yisrael</I> felt the need to develop natural mechanisms like the mission of the <I>meraglim</I> that would afford them a measure of self-sufficiency based on the principle of "<I>ein somekhin al ha-nes</I>". When perceived from this perspective, the mission of the <I>meraglim</I> may represent an important policy departure in the spiritual development of <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>. One might suggest that this transition was an inherently precarious one as it would test the delicate relationship between <I>hishtadlut</I> and <I>bitahon</I> alluded to by R. Behai, even as it would set the tone for a more pragmatic approach to the implementation of the idealistic Divine program that aspires to produce a "<I>mamlekhet kohanim ve-goy kadosh</I>". </P>
<P>Moshe endorsed this mission because, given the new reality, it was both appropriate and a critical testing ground for the new order. He entrusted the challenge to those whose leadership credentials in the "<I>mattan Torah</I>" era were well established. At the same time, he was apparently wary of the outcome and questioned the ability of even such spiritual giants to effectively integrate the idealism of <I>bitahon</I> and <I>yirat shamayim</I> in such a highly pragmatic quest. His precautionary name change for Yehoshua reflects this ambivalent posture. </P>
<P>The transgression of the <I>meraglim</I> can now be seen in a different light. The failure of these acknowledged spiritual leaders to manage this transition effectively by rising to the formidable challenge of an uncompromising standard of idealism and overriding faith notwithstanding the pragmatic nature of their mission reflected a critical spiritual character flaw and constituted a devastating blow to the spiritual aspirations of all of <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>. In retrospect, the <I>meraglim</I> demonstrated that their previously established spiritual qualifications were limited and one dimensional. Considering the recent events in which they had experienced Hashem's presence and <I>hashgahah</I>, and in light of the unprecedented leadership opportunity to establish the predominance of faith and idealism especially within a more natural and human order, their unacceptable response was not merely a failure of omission. Indeed, it was tantamount to an act of rebellion and blasphemy against Hashem. Thus, it is unsurprising that the Torah would record the <I>keriah</I> reaction of Yehoshuah and Kalev (Bamidbar 14:6), which <I>halakhically</I> is associated with mourning and with <I>giduf</I> (blasphemy- Sanhedrin 60a). <I>Hazal</I> explain that the <I>meraglim's</I> unacceptable response in essence constituted an implicit attack on Hashem (Midrash and Rashi, Bamidbar 13:31) and his providential convenant with <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>. Although the principle of "<I>ein somekhin al ha-nes</I>", projected by the Ramban and R. Behai, technically legitimates this mission and one should not have expected the <I>meraglim</I> to falsify the basic facts of their finding, the overriding spiritual urgency at this time and place demanded no less than a ringing unequivocal affirmation of faith and idealism. The Ramban himself formulates a parallel perspective with respect to the flawed attitude of <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>: "<I>she-hem rau yeshuat Hashem ve-hayah lahem lalekhet aharei he-anan el asher yihiyeh shamah ha-ruah lalekhet</I>" (Ramban, Bamidbar 13:2). </P>
<P>Kalev's double double-emphasis of "<I>aloh naaleh ve-yarashnu otah ki yakhol nukhal lah</I>" (Bamidbar 13:30), which <I>Hazal</I> interpret as an unswerving commitment to follow Moshe Rabbenu's leadership and Hashem's commandment even if it meant climbing into the heavens itself, an apt symbol for the total abandonment of the pragmatic approach if need be, effectively encapsulates the sharp contrast to the <I>meraglim</I>. This powerful formulation is introduced <I>by "Va-yahas Kalev et ha-am el Moshe</I>" (Bamidbar 13: 30). Kalev correctly intuited that merely conveying "the facts" in a context that demanded spiritual courage, leadership and ambition constituted a negative agenda and an implicit attack on Moshe's leadership. His intuition is borne out several <I>pesukim</I> later (Bamidbar 14:2-4) when the entire process of <I>yeziat Mizrayim</I>, built on this structure of faith, idealism and spiritual ambition, is questioned. <I>Darshanim</I> have noted that the narrow self-image exhibited by the <I>meraglim</I> and their limited faith in the destiny that Hashem had promised actually contributed to their vulnerability. Thus, <I>"va-nehi be-eineinu ke-hagavim</I>" precedes "<I>ve-khen hayyiynu be-eineihem</I>"(Bamidbar 13:33). </P>
<P>The Yerushalmi (Taanit 4:5) explains that the Jewish people had already begun to study the laws of <I>Halah</I> and <I>Orlah</I> in anticipation of their imminent arrival in Erez Yisrael. They cried (Bamidbar 14:1- "<I>va-tisa kol ha-edah va-yitnu et kolam</I>") upon hearing the report of the <I>meraglim</I> not only because of their fears, but because their ideal <I>halakhic</I> aspirations were shattered. The blow to idealism and <I>bitahon</I> constituted a grievous crime against Hashem and <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>, in addition to the impact of the delay of entry into <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>. </P>
<I><P>Hazal</I> link the conclusion of <I>Behalotkhah</I> and the episode of the <I>meraglim</I> by noting that both involved <I>lashon hara</I>. It is possible, however, that there is an additional dimension to this common denominator. Miriam seriously miscalculated when she failed to recognize the uniqueness of Moshe's leadership and prophecy- "<I>lo ken avdi Moshe</I>" (Bamidbar 12:7). Her critique of Moshe's family life revealed that she improperly applied a natural and pragmatic yardstick to the "<I>eved Hashem</I>" par excellence. This constituted a significant flaw in her own leadership and spirituality that needed to be addressed. In a similar vein, the <I>meraglim</I> misconstrued the new mandate of <I>hishtadlut</I> implied by their mission, and failed to seize an opportunity to project the necessary balance accenting idealism, commitment and faith that would justify and even idealize this approach. Yehoshua and Kalev alone were able to exemplify inspiring and effective spiritual leadership. Yehoshua's pervasive awareness of Hashem's presence and interest is reflected in the new identity bestowed upon him by Moshe Rabbenu (Sotah 34b). Kalev's ability to rise to the occasion and to transcend a pragmatic perspective is succinctly expressed in Hashem's depiction of him as an "<I>eved</I>" invested with a different kind of spirit (Bamidbar 14:24: "<I>ve-avdi Kalev ekev haytah ruah aheret imo</I>"). </P>
<P>The episode of the <I>meraglim</I> conveys a critical principle in Jewish life and leadership. Conduct and decision making that might generally qualify as reasonable and responsible leadership may under certain circumstances constitute an unforgiveable lapse and even a fundamental betrayal of principle. When the spiritual destiny of <I>Kellal Yisrael</I> is at stake, one must strive to assert oneself as an "<I>eved Hashem</I>" by developing a "<I>ruah aheret</I>", never eschewing idealism and faith for a purely pragmatic program. The aspiration of "<I>mamlekhet kohanim ve-goy kadosh</I>" demands nothing less. </P>

<P>The beginning of <I>Sefer Shemot</I> chronicles the development of Moshe Rabbeinu, the penultimate exemplar of Jewish leadership, as he increasingly assumes this mantle.  In two crucial and formative encounters, Moshe's special role, as well as his unique relationship with Hashem, is strikingly formulated by contrasting the Divine name invoked in connection with his mission with that utilized in connection with the <I>avot</I> (forefathers).   A brief examination of Rambam's interpretation of these two episodes and formulations may further illuminate Moshe's special legacy of leadership.  </P>
<P>In the first revelation, in the context of the "burning bush", Moshe inquires how God is to be represented to the nation<I>--"ve-amarti lahem elokei avoteikhem shelahani aleikhem; ve-amru li mah shemo, mah omar aleihem?"</I>  He is told to respond with a new and unusual Divine reference, albeit to remind the nation that He remains the God of the <I>avot</I> (Shemot 3:14-15).  Rambam (Moreh Nevukhim I:63) notes that while the <I>avot</I> and perhaps others had previously experienced individual Divine  revelation, Moshe's encounter constituted  the first prophetic mission in history, as he was mandated to share the prophetic message with the nation.  The integration of the highly personal prophetic experience with national destiny required a different approach, reflected in the different representation of God's identity.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <I>parshat Va-Eira</I>, with Moshe already having embarked upon his mission to liberate <I>Kelal Yisrael</I> from Egypt, Hashem takes the initiative in accenting His different relationship with Moshe, again as signified by means of a different Divine representation.  We are informed (Shemot 6:2,3): <I>"Va-yedaber Elokim el Moshe, va-yomer elav ani Hashem.  Va-eira el Avraham...u-shemi Hashem lo nodaati la-hem"</I>.  Rambam (2:35; Perush ha-Mishnah Sanhedrin  10:1:7; Yesodei ha-Torah 7:6; Ramban, Shemot 6:2)  suggests that these <I>pesukim</I> establish the unparalleled quality of Mosaic prophecy, hinted at elsewhere in the Torah (Bamidbar 12:6-8:Devarim 34:10-12), which forms one of the thirteen principle tenets of Judaism, and serves the foundation for yet another- the immutability of the Torah, the content of that unique prophecy.  </P>
<P>The two episodes-formulations underscore two contrasting dimensions of Moshe's personality and leadership, the integration of which constitute his special legacy, establishing the model for ideal Jewish leadership.  Moshe's special qualities and capabilities, as well as his potential stature as a spiritual giant were apparently innate.  The Torah (Shemot 1:2) records that <I>"va-tera oto ki tov hu"</I>.  Hazal indicate that Moshe's presence illuminated the home.  They understand that his special qualities were apparent not only to his family, reflected in the construction of his teva, in which the stench of the tar was kept outside, but were evident even to Paroh's daughter, drawn to an extraordinary baby exhibiting the behaviour and character of both <I>naar</I> and <I>yeled</I> (1:6).   Although, he was the object that was drawn from the water, she instinctively named him Moshe, connoting that he would exercise initiative and leadership (Ibn Ezra and other <I>mefarshim</I> Shemot 1:10).   At the same time, it is noteworthy that Moshe initially expresses and develops his greatness not in the spiritual realm, but precisely through his humanity, by means of his empathy with <I>Klal Yisrael- "Vayehi ba-yamim ha-hem va-yigdal Moshe va-yeze el ehav va-yare be-sivlotam..." </I>(Shemot 1:11).  Hazal understand that his initial encounter with the Shechinah was consequent upon his development as a shepherd, a process which inculcated sensitivity and responsibility (3:1-2).  </P>
<P>It is consistent with this theme, that the special representation of the Divine name that emerges from that initial encounter accents precisely Moshe's national obligation, underscoring that his spiritual stature is inherently intertwined with the destiny of <I>Klal Yisrael.</I>    Moreover, it is in keeping with the dialectial, yet integrated nature of Moshe's personality and leadership that once committed to the political role, he would now be made aware of his unique personal spiritual status as an unsurpassed prophet whose communication with Hashem defied all previous and future models.  We might have anticipated that these two developments be transposed given the distinctive contexts.  After all, the sneh encounter was an intensely personal religious experience while the formulation of a different relationship in <I>Va-Era</I> is enmeshed within the strategic approach to Paroh and <I>Klal Yisrael</I>.  Moreover, Moshe's innate potential and charisma preceded his empathy, and undoubtedly it was his spiritual credentials that qualified him for that initial revelation as well.  The Torah projects a powerful lesson by reversing its emphasis in these two episodes.  </P>
<P>The intricate relationship between Moshe and Aharon, reflected in <I>Va-Era</I> and later in their diverse formal functions, confirms the complexity and multidimensionality of Jewish leadership.  While both are crucial to the process of <I>yeziat mizrayim</I>, the Torah occasionally reverses the order of their priority (Shemot 6:13, 26-27).   Some commentators suggest a practical explanation: Aharon was well-known and trusted by <I>Klal Yisrael</I>, while Moshe, a virtual stranger to his own people, was a familiar figure in Paroh's court (Neziv, 6:27).  Rashi, however, insists that the Torah simply intended to establish their equal contributions.  Hazal indicate that the initial charge to redeem <I>Klal Yisrael</I> was issued simultaneously to both Moshe and Aharon (Yalkut Shimoni, Shemot no. 174).  Rashi's comment is not inconsistent with the accepted view of Moshe's spiritual superiority, but undoubtedly reflects the complex agenda and diverse nature of Jewish leadership.  </P>
<P>In this light, it is particularly interesting that Moshe emerged as the national leader of <I>Klal Yisrael</I> and the symbol of <I>malkhut</I>, while Aharon was entrusted with the institution of <I>kehunah</I>, with its spiritual and ideal emphasis on the mikdash and purity. While both Moshe and Aharon integrated the spiritual-national dialectic of <I>"ameikh ami"</I> <I>and "elokayikh elokai"</I> (Ruth 1:16), one might have expected that the unsurpassed <I>"eved Hashem",</I> Moshe, who had a special affinity to the laws of sacrifices and purity, would find his ultimate fulfillment in <I>kehunah</I> (see Yalkut Shemoni, beg. of Vayikra).  This expectation might also have been rooted in an assessment of the personalities of Moshe and Aharon, as well.  Moshe, occasionally impatient with the flaws of <I>Klal Yisrael</I>, is described as the rigid idealist who eschews compromise in favor of "<I>yikov ha-din et ha-har</I> "(Sanhedrin 6b), while Aharon, who earned the epithet of "<I>ohev shalom ve-rodef shalom</I>",  projects <I>pesharah</I> (compromise) as an ideal, and developed the kind of relationship with the entire Klal Yisrael that is reflected in the reaction of "<I>va-yivku et Aharon sheloshim yom kol beit yisrael</I>" (Bamidbar 20:29) to his passing.  Upon further reflection, however, it may be suggested that this ambitious integration of national destiny and personal spirituality is particularly well-served precisely by projecting the strongest emphasis of spiritual standards in national leadership, even as the values of intense human empathy and sensitivity reflected by Aharon ha-Kohen, are associated with the purist realms of <I>kodashim</I> and <I>taharot</I>.  </P>
<P>Perhaps it is no coincidence that the Torah, precisely in this context in Vaera (6:14-29) finds it necessary to locate Moshe and Aharon within the framework of the rest of the shevatim - "<I>hu Aharon u-Moshe...hem ha-medabrim el Paroh...hu Moshe ve-Aharon</I>"(6:26-27:)- lest their impressive spiritual credentials and charismatic feats be misconstrued.  It is important that we appreciate that their common origins in <I>Klal Yisrael</I>, as well as their special spiritual and leadership qualities qualified them for their unique role in this particularly challenging and defining era in Jewish history.</P>
<P>The final <I>pesukim</I> of the Torah itself, in summing up Moshe's legacy, and perhaps by implication, the Torah's special perspective on spirituality and leadership, focuses precisely on the dialectic of national-spiritual achievement (Devarim 34:10-12).  While the initial emphasis is on Moshe's unique prophecy- "<I>ve-lo kam navi od be-yisrael ke-Moshe asher yedao Hashem panim el panim</I>"--, the immediate transition to his mission of national destiny--"<I>lekol ha-otot ve-hamoftim asher shelaho Hashem laasot be-eretz Mizrayim</I>"-- as well as to his effective leadership vis a vis Paroh-- "<I>le-Paroh u-lekol avadav u-lekol arzo</I>." underscores the various dimensions of his leadership. </P>
<P>In addition to his status as the unsurpassed navi, as "<I>eved Hashem</I>"(Devarim 34:5), and as national leader, Moshe was also the vehicle for <I>mattan </I>and <I>kabbalat ha-Torah</I>, also serving as the first link in the historic chain of the tradition of <I>Torah she-baal peh</I>.  It is evident that in this capacity, quite simply captured in the title Moshe "Rabbenu", all of his other functions and dimensions converge.  Hazal characterize Torah, too, as a realm, but emphasize that this crown, in contradistinction to the <I>keter malkhut</I> and <I>kehunah</I>, is accessible to all.  Indeed, it is precisely the content of Torah and the process of Torah study that most fully integrates all of the spiritually and nationally ambitious dimensions reflected in both of Moshe's early encounters.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[The Character and Compassion of Yosef]]></title>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: mekeitz]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<P>From the very moment that Yosef <I>HaTzadik</I> recognizes his brothers he treats them in a surprisingly harsh and seemingly unforgiving manner. Not only does Yosef unfairly accuse his brothers of spying, he further demands that Binyamin be brought to <I>Mitzrayim</I>. Perhaps what is most striking is his apparent lack of concern for his father Yaakov. How could Yosef remain indifferent to the anguish of Yaakov's suffering? How are we to understand the failure of Yosef to communicate and inform Yaakov that he was still alive? </P>
<P>When Yehudah confronts Yosef, he describes Yosef as dead, "<I>veechav met</I>" (Bereishis 44:20). Rashi explains that because of fear, "<I>haya motzi davar sheker me piv</I>", Yehudah misspoke for he could not be certain of Yosef's fate. However, the Meshech Chochmah defends yehudah's assertion. Yehudah reasoned that had Yosef been alive, he surely would have contacted his father. The Meshech Chochmah cites Rashi (<I>Ketobos</I> 22b) who allows a woman to definitively assert that her husband has died based on the notion that, "<I>ilu haya kayam haya bah</I>", if indeed he was alive he would have surely returned. </P>
<P>Ultimately, the Torah conveys the true compassionate character of Yosef <I>haTzadik</I>, as it describes his inability to restrain himself any further, and his revelation of his identity, emphasizing, "<I>Ki lemichya shelachani elokim lifneichem</I>", , that all that had transpired reflected <I>yad Hashem</I>. Yosef reiterated his true conciliatory feelings, "<I>Elokim chashva letovah</I>" (50:20). Hashem intended it for good.</P>
<P>However, the righteous and compassionate nature of Yosef  further reinforces the obvious difficulty, i.e., Why did Yosef wait so long to identify himself? The Ramban explains that the answer can be found in the following <I>pasuk</I>, "<I>Vayizkor Yosef et hachalomot asher chalam lahem vayomer aleihem meraglim atem</I>" (42:9). Yosef recalled the dreams that he dreamt about them, and he said to them, "You are spies." Unlike Rashi, Who sees Yosef's brother coming to <I>Mitzrayim</I> as a fulfillment of these dreams, the Ramban maintains that unless Binyamin would join his brothers in <I>Mitzrayim</I>,  the dreams would remain unfulfilled. Driven by these dreams, which Yosef considered prophecy, he surpressed his otherwise compassionate nature to ensure that Binyamin would in fact come to <I>Mitzrayim</I>. </P>
<P>The Midrash alludes to a further explanation of Yosef's behavior and objective. The grievous  sin of <I>mechiras Yosef</I>  placed an almost unbearable burden on the brothers. Rav Mayer (<I>Sanhedrin</I> 6b)  is especially critical of Yehudah. Although he was greatly respected by his brothers he failed to exhibit responsible leadership. It was Yosef's desire to provide his brothers with an opportunity to redeem themselvesm a chance to secure complete <I>teshuvah</I>. Rav Yehudah explains (<I>Yoma</I> 86b) that the true measure of <I>teshuvah</I> is when an individual is faced with similar conditions to those that previously led him to sin, and he is able to overcome temptation and fulfill the <I>ratzon Hashem</I>. By insisting that Binyamin come to <I>Mitzrayim</I> and by accusing him of stealing, Yosef was able to test the true character of his brothers. Would they unite and rescue their younger brother or would they forsake him as they had abandoned Yosef? Hence, when Yehudah exhibited true leadership and <I>mesiras nefesh</I> by confronting Yosef and demanding Binyamin's release, Yosef immediately reveals his identity. The feelings of jealousy and enmity of the past are now replaced with feelings of compassionate brother hood.</P>

		<content><![CDATA[




<P>The many restrictions imposed on the <I>metzora</I>, as well as the detailed process of his purification, underscore the uniqueness and severity of <I>tzara'at</I>. 
Unlike other forms of <I>tum'ah</I>, which prevent an individual from entering various parts of <I>the Beit Hamikdash</I>, the <I>metzora</I> is forced to 
leave the entire <I>machaneh Yisroel </I>(camp of Israel).</P>

<P>The Gemara (<I>Erachin</I> 16B) links this isolation with the very cause of <I>tzara'at</I> itself.
 <I>"Ma nishtana metzora sheamra Torah 'badad yesheiv michutz lemachaneh moshavo'? hu hivdil bein ish l'ishto, bein ish lerei-eihu, lefichoch amra Torah, 
 'badad yesheiv '"</I> ("Why is a <I>metzora</I> different that the Torah states, 'He shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall be his dwelling'? 
 He [through his slander] separated a husband from his wife, a man from his neighbor, therefore the Torah says, 'He shall dwell alone.'")</P>

<P>The slanderous <I>metzora</I>, who through his behavior fails to value the harmony of the community, must live in isolation.</P>

<P>The laws governing the <I>metzora</I>, however, extend far beyond his sequester. Based on the verse, <I>"begadav yehiyu prumim 
verosho yehiye parua veal safam yateh"</I> (Vayikrah 13:45)  ("His garments shall be torn, the hair of his head shall be unshorn, 
and he shall cloak himself up to his lips"), the Gemara explains that a <I>metzora</I> must tear his garment and cover his head, as well
 as refrain from cutting his hair and greeting others (Moed Katan 15A).</P>

<P>The common theme linking these <I>halachot</I> implied by the Gemara and stated explicitly by the Rambam (Hilchot Tum'at Tzara'at 10:6) 
is <I>Aveilut</I>. The <I>metzora</I> is an <I>avel</I> and hence is bound by the many obligations and restrictions of mourning. In what sense, 
however, is a <I>metzora</I> an <I>avel</I>? Why is it that he must observe the traditions of <I>aveilut</I>?</P>

<P>Each member of <I>Knesset Yisrael</I> possesses a twofold <I>kedushah</I>-as an individual and as a vital part of the collectivity of 
<I>Bnei Yisrael</I>. A <I>metzora</I>, through his callous slander, severs his bond with the collective <I>kedushah</I> of <I>Bnei Yisrael</I>; 
it is as if part of him has died. Indeed, the Gemara states that <I>"arba'ah chashuvin kemeis - ani umetzora..."</I> (Nedarim 64B)
("four [types of people] are as if they are dead - a poor man, a <I>metzora</I>..."). Accordingly, the Torah mandates <I>aveilut</I>; the <I>metzora</I> mourns himself.</P>

<P>The onset of <I>Yom Tov</I>, however, marks a clear contrast between the <I>avel</I> and the <I>metzora</I>. Whereas the commencement 
of <I>Yom Tov</I> cancels <I>aveilut</I>, the Gemara (Moed Katan 14B), states that <I>"noheig tzora'ato b'regel"</I> ("the laws of 
the <I>metzora</I> apply on <I>Yom Tov</I>"). How do we understand this distinction? The ability of <I>Yom Tov</I> to suspend <I>aveilut</I> 
stems from the communal nature of <I>Yom Tov</I>: <I>"asi aseh  d'Ravm [Yom Tov] v'dachi aseh  d'yachid [aveilus]"</I> ("Let the 
public commandment of <I>Yom Tov</I> come and supersede the individual commandment of mourning"). A <I>metzora</I>, however, has severed his 
bond to the community. For him, the communal nature of <I>Yom Tov</I> cannot suspend the obligations and restrictions of <I>tzara'at</I>.</P>

<P>The plight of the <I>metzora</I> highlights the privilege and responsibility of <I>kedushat Yisrael</I>. 
May we be the worthy beneficiaries of this transcendent gift.</P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>How can we understand the strange phenomenon of anti-Semitism which has existed throughout the ages in all societies? In the <I>Pesach haggadah</I> we mention that, "<I>Bechol dor vador omdim aleinu lechaloteinu</I>," - in every generation there is some group attempting to wipe out the Jews. There can not be a sociological explanation for this phenomenon if it appears in so many different societies.</P>
<P>In <I>Parshat Haazinu</I> (32:12) we read, "<I>Hashem badad yanchenu</I>,"- that God guides his nation <U>all alone</U> with no other power assisting Him. The Ravs of the Talmud (Chagigah 3a) understood the meaning of "<I>Shema Yisroel..Hashem echad</I>" to be that not only is there only one god, as opposed to any number more than one; but also that God is unique. When the Jewish people proclaim <I>Shema</I>, we are proclaiming God as a <U>unique</U> Being. </P>
<P>When God proclaims, "<I>Mi keamcha yisroel, goy echad baaretz</I>," He is proclaiming the <U>uniqueness</U> of the Jewish people. Each is suigenerous. Bilaam (<I>Bamidbar</I> 23:9) described the uniqueness of the Jewish people with the same terminology used regarding God Himself, i.e., the nation dwells "<I>levadad</I>", "<I>hen am levadad yishkon</I>.." The Torah later (<I>Devarim</I> 33:28) picks up on this expression first used by Bilaam, "<I>Vayishkon yisroel</I> <I>betach badad eyn Yaakov</I>," that the Jewish people indeed do live in this world in a state of isolation- <I>badad</I> - due to their uniqueness. All human beings were created <I>betzelem</I> <I>elokim</I>, but only <I>Benei Yisroel</I> are referred to as <I>Banim LeMakom</I>. They have received the genes of uniqueness, so to speak, from God Himself. </P>
<P>In our prayers we mention the fact that, "<I>Veshimcha hagadol vehakadosh aleinu karata</I>," that Hashem has incorporated the great and holy name into ours: We are called Am Hashem- the nation of God. We also mention in our prayers "<I>Ushmeinu karata</I> <I>bishmecha</I>," that He has also incorporated our name into His. God is known as <I>Elokei</I> <I>Yisroel</I>, the God of the Jewish People. In some countries the practice was for the wife to adopt the husband's family name, while in others the practice was for the husband to take the wife's family name. (Just to cite one famous example, the Maharsha took on his wife's family name, Edles.) The relationship between the Jewish people and God is commonly compared (by the Tanach) to that of a husband and wife. The compatibility of "the couple" lies in the fact that each one is <I>badad</I>- unique.</P>
<P>All people tend to distrust others who are different, and the Jewish people are always different. Despite the fact that in recent years one of the prime ministers of <I>medinat yisrael</I> declared in his inaugural address that, "We shall no longer be an <I>am</I> <I>levadad yishkon</I>," this situation will never change. It is built in by God, into the nature and the character of our people. We always have a totally different perspective on everything. When Rivka <I>Imeinu</I> was pregnant with her twin boys the Torah tells us that they were already fighting with each other, "<I>vayitrotzetzu habanim</I> <I>bekirbah</I>." The Ravs of the Talmud had an old tradition, "<I>Halachah beyaduah sheesav soneh leYaakov</I>."</P>
<P>In recent years, many Jews have been thinking according to what is "politically correct", as opposed to thinking correctly. The angel teaches every Jewish soul Torah before being born. We all have to learn Torah to orient ourselves towards "thinking Jewishly." The Torah is "God's way of thinking." The first steps in <I>teshuvah</I> are to learn more Torah. We pray every day, "<I>Hashivenu avinu letoratecha..vehachzireinu betshuvah shlemah</I> <I>lefanecha</I>." Please bring us back to Torah study so that we will be able to do complete <I>teshuvah</I>.</P>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>This coming <I>Shabbos</I>, when we read <I>Parshas Ki Savo,</I> we will be fulfilling a double mitzvah: 1) We will be reading the <I>parshas hashavua</I> 2) We will be fulfilling the special <I>takannah</I> made by Ezra, i.e., to read the <I>tochacha</I> of <I>Ki Savo</I> soon before Rosh Hashana.</P>
<P><I>Achronim</I> point out that it would appear from the Talmud that even when the practice was to have a tri-annual cycle of Torah reading, so that Simchas Torah only occurred once every three years, and <I>Parshas Ki Savo</I> did not fall out near Rosh Hashana, the <I>tochacha</I> would still be read, as a special <I>kriah</I> soon before Rosh Hashana (similar to the reading of <I>Parshios Zachor</I> and <I>Parah</I>.)</P>
<P>In the concluding <I>pasuk</I> of the <I>tochacha</I>, we read that the Jewish people entered into this contract with G-d in addition to the original agreement (appearing in <I>Parshas Bechukosai</I>) that was proclaimed at <I>Har Sinai</I>. The question begs itself: why was there a need for an additional <I>bris</I> (covenant)? Why wasn't the first contract binding?</P>
<P>The answer to this question appears in the <I>chumash</I> itself in the opening <I>pesukim</I> of <I>Parshas Nitzavim</I>. In these <I>pesukim</I> Moshe specifically indicates that this covenant entered into between <I>Bnai Yisrael</I> and G-d prior to Moshe's death involves not only the Jews currently there, but all future generations: "<I>Velo itchem levadchem...ki et asher yeshno po imanu omed hayom lifnei Hasham elokeinu, veet asher einenu po imanu</I> <I>hayom</I>," (29:13-14). This statement implies that the first covenant, that which took place at <I>Har Sinai</I>, was only binding between G-d and those individuals who lived in that generation.</P>
<P>In the text of the <I>tochacha</I> in <I>Parshas Bechukosai</I>, the Jewish people are referred to in the plural form because that <I>bris</I> was made with the many individual members of <I>Klal Yisrael</I>. In the <I>tochacha</I> in Ki Savo, however, the Jewish people are referred to in the singular. This "contract" was made with <I>Klal Yisrael</I>, and <I>Klal yisrael</I> is a simple entity which includes all of the Jews who lived throughout all the generations, starting from the trip of <I>Avraham Avinu</I> until <I>Yemos Hamoshiach</I>. The fact that all the souls were present at <I>Maamad Har Sinai</I> had an effect on all of us in a supernatural way. "<I>Baavur yishma ho'om bedabri imach vegam becha yaaminu leolam</I>" (Shemos 19:9), "<I>Uvaavur tihiye yirato al peneichem levilti techetau</I>," (Shemos 20:17).</P>
<P>But this was not enough to make the Torah laws legally binding on all future generations. After the forty years of tRavelling in the desert we finally became a nation. When the Jews crossed over the Jordan and entered <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> they completed this second <I>bris</I>. The <I>bris</I> began with Moshe Rabeinu at <I>arvot moav</I> and completed by his successor Yehoshua ben Nun at <I>Har Gerizim</I> and <I>Har Aival</I>. According to the talmudic tradition, the principle of, "<I>kol Yisrael arevim zeh bazeh</I>", did not begin to function until this <I>bris</I> was completed. That is when we became a nation.</P>
<P>In every generation there are individuals who chose not to keep the <I>mitzvos</I>. These people want to "be themselves" and "do their own thing". Truth of the matter is that whether we like it or not we are all part of <I>Klal Yisrael</I>. Keeping the <I>mitzvos</I> is "the natural thing" to do. When one chooses not to keep <I>mitzvos</I>, he is running away from his real self. </P>
<P>Every day in our prayers we mention the words of the prophet: "<I>Veani zos berisi osam amar Hashem ruchi asher alecha udevarai asher samti beficha lo yamushu mipicha umepi zaracha umepi zera zaracha amar Hashem meata vead olam</I>, " (Yeshayah 59:21). G-d has imposed His "<I>bris</I>" upon us. The <I>navi</I> did not say, "<I>brisi etach</I>" , My contract with you, but rather "<I>berisi otach</I>", ie., My <I>bris</I> is hereby being imposed upon you. You can never run away from the Torah. Even if for a generation or two people leave the Torah, "<I>umepi zerah zaracha meata vead olam</I>," ultimately the later generations will have to return. It is the natural thing to do. It will have to happen. The Rambam points out that the Torah has already promised us that ultimately the Jewish people will have to do <I>teshuvah</I>. All the future generations are part of <I>Knesses Yisroel</I> which entered into the second <I>bris</I> with Hashem. </P>
<P>Ezra's enactment (<I>takanah</I>) requires that we review this national commitment as contained in the <I>bris</I> in <I>Ki Savo</I>, every year prior to Rosh Hashana. Whether we like it or not this is part of our genetic composition. We are all part of <I>Klal Yisroel</I>, carrying on in that ancient tradition from <I>Avraham Avinu</I>. We must act in accordance with who we really are. </P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: kisisa]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>Towards the end of <I>Parshat Ki Tissa</I>, Moshe is told by <I>Hakadosh Baruch Hu </I>that he will be giving him a two-part Torah - part <I>biketav</I>, in writing, and part <I>baal peh</I>, oral. These two parts of the Torah must be transmitted from generation to generation, each in its own fashion. The Torah <I>shebiktav</I> must be taught <I>mitoch haketav</I>, from reading from a written scroll, while the Torah <I>shebaal peh</I> must be transmitted orally. The Talmud (<I>Temura</I> 14b) records that at a certain point in history the Ravs felt that there was a serious concern that the insistence on observing this point of law could possibly cause much of the Oral Torah to be forgotten, so they permitted the transmitting of the Torah <I>shebaal peh</I> from a written text. The expression used by the Talmud in this context is, "it is preferred that one letter of the Torah be violated, rather than have the entire Torah forgotten."</P>
<P>Rambam (<I>Mamrim</I> 2:4) gives an analogy from medicine to understand this point: Sometimes a doctor will amputate an arm or leg of a patient to keep him alive. Rambam, however, quotes from the Talmud (<I>Yevamot</I> 90b) that such a special "<I>hetter</I>" may be practiced only as a <I>horaat shaah</I> (on a temporary basis) and not <I>ledorot</I> (permanently). </P>
<P>Many centuries have passed and the Oral Torah is still being taught from written texts of <I>Mishnayot</I>, Talmud, and <I>Shulchan Aruch</I>. This poses an obvious problem. Can a practice which has continued for close to two thousand years be considered a <I>horaat shaah</I> because at some time in the future (i.e. <I>leyemot hamoshiach</I>) that practice will be discontinued? This issue is dealt with in the classical <I>halachic</I> literature.</P>
<P>Exactly when this change in the style of teaching the Torah <I>shebaal peh </I>occurred was a question among the scholars. It is generally assumed today that this change occurred after the times of Ravina and Rav Ashi. The Talmud quotes several passages from the "<I>Sefer</I> of Adam <I>Harishon</I>", the book that God showed Adam about the transmission and the development of the Torah throughout the ages. One such line reads that, "Ravina and Rav Ashi will be the end of the period of <I>horaah</I>." Rav Moshe Soloveitchik took this to be referring to the aforementioned issue: because after their time the Torah <I>shebaal peh</I> was no longer being transmitted orally, the status of the Ravs as "<I>baalei horaah</I>" was lowered <I>halachically</I>. All the Ravs from the days of Yehoshua until the days of Ravina and Rav Ashi had a higher level status of <I>baalei horaah</I> than those that followed them.  We therefore assume that while in each generation the Ravs are entitled to express their own original opinions, even in disagreement with those who preceded them, those following Ravina and Rav Ashi do not have the authority to disagree with the accepted positions of the Talmud. Only a "<I>baal horaah</I>" is entitled to an opinion, (<I>Horaah</I> being a definitive position on a matter of Torah <I>shebaal peh</I>) and the "<I>baalei horaah" </I>of the later period, when the Oral Torah was no longer being transmitted orally, are on a <I>halachically</I> lower level.</P>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Hershel Schachter]]></author>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: korach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The Torah, in describing Korach's revolt against the authority of Moshe, states that Korach argued that "the entire nation is equally holy", i.e. they were all present at Mt. Sinai and all received the same Torah directly from <I>Hakodosh Baruch Hu</I>. Why, Korach asked, should Moshe alone be the final authority on all halachic matters? Shouldn't each individual have the right to interpret the Torah according to his own understanding?</P>
<P>This attitude of Korach is not unique to him alone. Any intelligent human being wants others to respect his intelligence, and prefers to maintain his independence in making decisions that affect him. People do not like being subservient to others. </P>
<P>According to the tradition recorded in the Talmud (Shabbos 88a), at the occasion of <I>Ma'amad Har Sinai</I> G-d had to force the Torah upon the Jewish people by threatening to bury them alive if they did not accept it (Shemos 19:17). The commentaries have great difficulty with this statement. The Torah seems to say explicitly that the entire Jewish nation accepted the Torah at <I>Har Sinai</I> out of their own free will (Shemos 24:7). Why did G-d have to force it upon them? </P>
<P>The Medrash Tanchuma (Parshas Noach) suggests that perhaps the two passages referred to above correspond to the two parts of the Torah. The people were prepared to accept the <I>Torah Shebiksav</I>, as this comes directly from G-d; man does not find it that humiliating to humble himself before G-d. The Jews were not that keen on accepting the <I>Torah Shebeal Peh</I>, which includes much Ravnic input, and whose main principle is "<I>Lo mesora hakosuv ella lechachomim</I>" (Chagigah 18a). This aspect of Torah dictates that one person's view is binding upon another, i.e., your opinion counts more than mine. This concept is a very bitter pill to swallow. The Jewish people, who had just gained their freedom from Egypt, were not yet prepared to accept the Ravs' role in developing the <I>Torah Shebeal Peh</I>. Therefore, <I>Hakodosh Baruch Hu</I> had to force the <I>Torah Shebeal Peh</I> upon them. </P>
<P>Many generations later, after the miracle of Purim occurred, the Ravs instituted the first <I>mitzvah midirabanon</I>, of reading the <I>megillah</I>. At that time, according to tradition of the Talmud, <I>Bnei Yisroel </I>accepted anew the oral Torah; this time out of their own free will. The Ravs of that generation, the <I>Anshei Kneses Hagedolah</I>, established the texts of blessings and prayers and standardized the observance of the <I>mitzvos</I>. The Seder Olam Zutta remarks that after the passing of the prophets Chagai, Zecharia, and Malachi, prophecy terminated (until the return of Eliyahu before the coming of Moshiach), and a new period began. Hence forth we had to "bend our ear, and listen to the words of the <I>chachomim</I>". This passage apparently refers to this new period where <I>Bnei Yosroel</I> had accepted the authority of the Ravs, and therefore the <I>Torah Shebeal Peh</I> was able to develop much more than ever before. This acceptance was the rejection of Korach's position that Judaism be "every - man's religion", that each person who learned Torah should be entitled to his own opinion. The nation as a whole had officially accepted the authority of the <I>chachomim</I> to develop the <I>Torah Shebeal Peh</I> . </P>
<P>We sometimes hear from religious people in our own circles that since Rav Soloveitchik has passed away, there is no one around to whom they can refer their <I>shaalos</I>. Many of those people use the passing of the Rav as an excuse to ignore the <I>piskei halacha</I> of contemporary <I>poskim</I>. They elect to make their own <I>halachic</I> decisions, justifying themselves by arguing that everyone in our generation is entitled to express their opinions equally, and all have equal authority. This was Korach's view, who stated that "the entire nation is holy", we all learned Torah together, and "all men were created equal". The Rav himself spoke out explicitly against such an attitude (See <U>Reflections of the Rav</U>, Volume One, Chapter 13).</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: matos-masei]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The Talmud understood that the main purpose of the books of <I>Neviim</I> and <I>Kesuvim</I> is to give <I>tochacha</I> to <I>Benei Yisrael</I>. If the Jewish people would not had not sinned, they would have been given only the five books of the Torah and the book of Yehoshua (Nedarim 22b). Yehoshua would have been singled out from among all the other <I>Kisvei Hakodesh</I> because it contains detailed accounts of the boundaries between the various <I>shevatim</I>. What is the significance of these accounts?</P>
<P>In Parshas Pinchas we learned that Hashem commanded Moshe Rabbeinu to go up to <I>Har Hoavarim</I> and take a good look at <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> before he died. The Vilna Gaon comments that studying the geography of Eretz Yisrael is a part of the mitzvah of Talmud Torah. Moshe Rabbeinu, the <I>Ish Hahalacha</I> par excellence, was studying the geography of <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> in order to complete his Torah knowledge. Similarly, Parshas Masei has a long detailed account of the boundaries of the holy land, and learning this section and understanding it is part of <I>limmud haTorah</I>. </P>
<P>The Zohar connects the fact that Moshe Rabbeinu looked at <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> only from a distance, to the fact that in Parshas Chukas, when <I>Benei Yisrael</I> were being bitten by snakes, Moshe Rabbeinu was commanded to place a copper figure of a snake on a tall pole, and all those who were bitten looked at this and were healed. Normally, for one to be cured by a medication, it must be applied to the body, sometimes internally, and sometimes externally. We are not familiar with a medication that heals simply by looking at it. The Zohar comments that only because Moshe Rabbeinu was such a deep thinker was it possible for him to both heal the sick simply by their looking from a distance at the <I>Nachash Hanechoshes</I>. Similarly, unlike the other members of <I>Klal Yisrael</I>, who needed to perform the agricultural <I>mitzvos</I> in <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> in order to reap the corresponding spiritual gains, he was able to do so by merely looking at the land from a distance. With respect to all other people, just as medications don't heal from a distance, <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> does not affect us from a distance. </P>
<P>The Ravs of the Talmud had a tradition that <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> was endowed with properties of <I>kaparah</I> (Kesubos 111a). Those who are buried there gain atonement, but those that live there gain an even greater degree of <I>kaparah</I>.</P>
<P><I>Eretz Yisroel</I> clearly has an effect on the Jewish people, and the Jewish people have an effect on the land. In Parshas Behar, The Torah tells us that when the <I>Yovel</I> year comes, all <I>avadim ivrim</I> go free, and anyone who had sold his <I>Sedeh Achuzah</I> in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> would get it back. The theme of <I>Yovel</I> is summed up in the <I>pasuk</I>, "..and thou shalt proclaim liberty throughout the land and to all its inhabitants." (This <I>pasuk</I> appears on the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia.) The Ravs (Erchin 32b) understood, from the wording of this <I>pasuk</I>, that the laws of <I>Yovel</I> only apply when all the Jewish people are located in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> ("<I>Bizman shekol yoshveha aleha</I>"). The presence of <I>Klal Yisrael</I> enhances the sanctity of the land.</P>
<P>Not only does the presence of the entire <I>Klal Yisrael</I> have an effect on <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>, but the presence of each and every Jew has an effect as well. Rambam (Shemitta Veyovel 10,2) quotes from Toras Kohanim that the sanctity of <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> did not set in until after the seven years it took to conquer the land, and the next seven years that it took to divide the entire land between the tribes and the individuals. Only when each and every individual Jew knew the exact location of his own personal plot of land was the <I>Kedushah</I> completed. If one steals anyone else's property anywhere in the world this is a serious violation. If one steals his neighbors field in <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>, there is an additional violation involved. He has diminished the sanctity of the land! The <I>kedushah</I> of <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> is only in its complete state when each individual Jew has his plot of land that is rightfully his. </P>
<P>In the opening <I>pasuk</I> of the book of <I>Eichah</I> the special relationship between the Jewish people and <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> is compared to that of a married couple. While the Jewish people are in <I>galus</I> the land behaves like a faithful wife who waits for her husband to return. Rashi, in his commentary on <I>Parshas Bechukosai</I> (26,32), points this out as well. In the midst of the bitter <I>tochacha</I>, the Torah has a few soft words, stating that when the Jews go into <I>galus</I> the land will remain desolate, and our enemies who in <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> will never really be satisfied there. The land will remain forever loyal and faithful to "her husband."</P>

<P>Our father Avrohom was known for his love of G-d. Yeshaya refers to him as, "<I>avraham ohavi,</I>" "the one who loved Me" (<I>Yeshaya</I> 41:8). In what way does man demonstrate his love for G-d?</P>

<P>Rambam, in <I>Sefer Hamitzvos, </I> (3<SUP>rd</SUP> <I>mitzvas aseh</I>) quotes the Talmudic comment (<I>Yoma 86a</I>) on the <I>pasuk</I>, "<I>Veahavta es Hashem elokecha</I>" (Devarim 6:5), that the way to demonstrate our love for<I> Hashem </I>is by inspiring other people to love Him as well, just as one who loves another person will praise him in public and try to motivate others to like him as well. The <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>ahavas Hashem</I> belongs to both the list of <I>chovos halevavos</I> and to the category of <I>chovos haevarim</I>. </P>

<P>In the beginning of <I>Parshas Lech Lecha</I> we read about the "<I>nefesh asher asu becharan,</I>" the many individuals whom Avrohom and Sara had brought to believe in Monotheism. </P>

<P>Rambam (first <I>perek </I>in <I> Hilchos Avodah Zarah</I>) quotes a <I>medrash </I>that states that Avraham had tens of thousands of followers. He was very outgoing, and the prophet Michah (7:20) singles him out for his <I>middas hachessed, </I>"<I>Titen emes leYaakov..."</I>. By showering much love upon others he affected people so that they came to love G-d as well.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, after the Torah relates the story of the <I>akeidah</I>, G-d's comment to Avrohom is mentioned, "Now I know that you are a God fearing individual." If Avrohom would have served G-d through love alone, he would not have been able to withstand the tremendous emotional strain of the <I>akeidah</I>. It was only because his love of G-d was coupled with a fear of Him that he succeeded in fulfilling this divine command (the Zohar develops this theme and uses the expression of "blending fire with water" fire is a reference to the fear of G-d, while water is an allusion to the love of god).</P>

<P>These two emotions are not mutually exclusive. There is no contradiction between them. Generally speaking, fear is a very unhealthy feeling. But fear of G-d is not unhealthy. The <I>pasuk</I> in <I>Mishlei</I> (10:27) tells us that, "<I>Yirat Hashem tosif yamim ushnot reshaim taktzirena</I>," that fear of G-d will add years to our lives. We are all obligated to keep both of these biblical <I>mitzvos</I>, both to love G-d and to fear Him at the <U>same time</U>.  The extent that one emphasizes one emotion over the other is a matter of one's personality. Each individual must figure out his own balance. </P>

<P>Yitzchak <I>Avinu</I> was known for his fear of G-d. (See <I>Bereishis </I>31:53, where Yaakov refers to G-d as "<I>pachad Yitzchak", </I>"the One whom my father feared.") But again, this does not mean that Yitzchak did not possess love of G-d as well. </P>

<P>The opening <I>pasuk </I>in<I> Parshas Vayeshev </I>states that Yaakov lived in <I>Eretz Canaan</I>, the land of <I>megurei aviv</I>, where his father (Yitzchak) had lived. The Ravs of the <I>medrash</I> add another level of interpretation to that phrase. They understood the expression, "<I>megurei</I>" to be rooted in the word, "<I>gerus</I>" - conversion. Just as Avraham engaged in mass proselytizing, so too did Yitzchak after him. True, it was not to the same extent as Avraham, as Yitzchak did not seem to have tens of thousands of followers. Though Yitzchak's dominant emotion was fear, he still possessed a blend with love of G-d in that ha also was involved in proselytizing, as is required of all Jews. Without possessing both of these emotions, we would not be able to fulfill all of the <I>mitzvos</I>. </P>

<P>In his collection of <I>teshuvos</I> entitled, "<I>Meshiv Davar</I>", the Netziv has an essay on the topic of right-wing, left-wing, and centrist Judaism. He explains that whoever does not keep all of the <I>mitzvos</I> is not acting in accordance with the teachings of Judaism. The three groups of Jews - acting as Jews- are divided in accordance with how they strike a balance between fear and love of G-d. Some follow Avraham, and place the emphasis on <I>chessed</I> and <I>ahavas Hashem</I>. Others follow Yitzchak, placing their emphasis on <I>midas hayirah</I>. The centrists are those who attempt to maintain more of a balance between the two emotions without emphasizing one or the other. </P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The <I>parshiyot</I> of Tazria and Metzora deal primarily with various <I>tumot</I> (spiritual impurities) that emanate from human beings, beginning with the laws of <I>tumah</I> concerning a woman after childbirth, then the detailed emphasis on the rules of <I>tzaraat</I>, and culminating with the laws of <I>negah</I>. The unifying theme of these <I>tumot</I> is that they all stem from a person's body. </P>

<P>There is one <I>pasuk</I> in <I>parshat</I> Tazria that appears to be unrelated to <I>tumah</I> - the requirement to perform a <I>brit milah</I> (circumcision) on the eighth day. Chazal in <I>Massechet</I> Shabbat (135a) note that it appears strange that the mitzvah of <I>brit</I> <I>milah</I> appears in <I>Parshat</I> <I>Hayoledet</I> together with the laws of <I>tumah</I> <I>vetaharah</I>. Perhaps the Torah is alluding to a significant aspect of <I>brit milah</I> by placing it in the context of <I>tumah vetaharah</I>.</P>

<P>The <I>Gemara</I> in <I>Massechet</I> Chagigah (2b) teaches us that one who is <I>tameh</I> or an <I>arel</I> (uncircumcised) cannot perform the <I>mitzvah</I> of visiting the <I>Beit HaMikdash</I> on the <I>Shalosh Regalim</I>. The reason for the exclusion of a <I>tameh</I> is obvious since the Torah explicitly prohibits him from entering the <I>Beit HaMikdash</I>. An <I>arel</I> is never explicitly excluded from the <I>Beit HaMikdash</I>, yet Chazal had a tradition that he is equivalent halachically to a <I>tameh</I>. This <I>halachah</I> sheds a new light on the mitzvah of <I>Brit Milah</I>. It indicates that it is not merely an action required by the Torah as other <I>mitzvot</I> such as <I>matzah</I> and <I>shofar</I>, but rather it transforms the individual from an <I>arel</I> to a <I>mahul</I> (circumcised), similar to <I>tevilah bemikvah</I> which transforms a <I>tameh</I> into a <I>tahor</I>.</P>

<P>The <I>halachah</I> that prohibits an <I>arel</I> from entering the <I>Beit HaMikdash</I>  is indicative of the fundamental distinction between an <I>arel</I> and a <I>mahul</I> in their respective relationships with Hashem. In <I>Parshat</I> Lech Lecha before Avraham is given the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>brit milah</I> he falls on the ground when Hashem speaks to him. Rashi comments that this phenomenon occurs as well in reference to Bilam. He is described as, "<I>nofel vegaluy eynaim</I>", -the one who falls when he sees. Avraham before <I>brit milah</I> and Bilam the <I>arel</I> cannot stand in the presence of Hashem. The <I>orlah</I> is an impediment to experiencing <I>hashraat hashechinah</I> in the fullest sense. This barrier prevents the <I>arel</I> from ever visiting the <I>Beit HaMikdash</I>. </P>

<P>This barrier of <I>orlah</I> had to be removed before the Jewish people could leave <I>Mitzrayim</I>. The <I>korban pesach</I>, whose blood clearly demarcated who was a Jew, was off limits to an <I>arel</I>. Becoming part of the nation of Hashem required the ability to experience <I>hashraat hashechinah</I> in the fullest sense. </P>

<I><P>Brit milah</I> as a prerequisite for a full relationship with Hashem exists not only in the realm of <I>korbanot</I> and the <I>Beit Hamikdash</I> but in our daily <I>avodat Hashem</I> as well. When a <I>brit milah</I> is performed a <I>brachah</I> is given: "<I>keshem shenichnas lebrit ken yikanes letorah lechupah ulemaasim tovim</I>". It appears that there is a connection between the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>brit milah</I> and all the subsequent <I>mitzvot</I> the child will perform. <I>Brit milah</I> is what enables the boy to live a life of <I>avodat Hashem</I>. Without it, his <I>Torah umitzvot</I>  could never be complete because there is a real barrier, a <I>tumah</I>, that separates him from Hashem. </P>

<P>Just as the <I>tameh</I> cannot reach the ultimate heights of spirituality, the <I>arel</I> is limited in his quest and can only become, at most, a "<I>mofel vegaluy eynaim</I>." <I>Tevilah</I> in the <I>mikvah</I> and <I>brit milah</I>, which enable people to come closer to Hashem, are appropriately the two procedures involved in the process of converting to Judaism, and reaching the greatest heights of <I>avodat</I> <I>Hashem</I>. </P>

<P><I>Parshat</I> Tazria and Metzora teach us how to overcome <I>tumah</I> and attain <I>taharah</I>, enabling us to experience <I>hashraat hashechinah. Brit milah</I> is an integral part of these <I>parshiyot</I> as it too facilitates our ability to reach this lofty goal. </P>

<P>Three major events occur in <I>Sefer Shmot</I>. The first is <I>yetziat Mitzrayim</I>, followed by <I>matan torah</I>, and finally, the construction of the <I>mishkan</I>. As the events of <I>Sefer Shmot</I> unfold, the bond between <I>Benei yisrael</I> and <I>Hashem </I>grows and develops. This relationship undergoes three specific stages of development, as the above the three  events occur.</P>

<I><P>Rambam</I> in <I>Hilchot Teshuvah</I> in describing the epitome of <I>ahavat Hashem</I> states that it is as powerful as the love between a husband and wife. the theme of <I>Shir HaShirim</I>, which appears to be a love song, is actually the highest expression of <I>ahavat Hashem. </I> Using marriage as a model we can understand the development of  the events in <I>Sefer Shmot</I>. </P>

<P>The Jewish process of marrying is comprised of three distinct stages. The first stage, known as <I>kiddushin</I> or <I>erussin</I> - betrothal - is the legal symbolic act of commitment that declares the couple "married" even though at this point  the husband and wife are not permitted to one another. From here each one returns to his and her parents home awaiting the culmination of the marriage ceremony. (Due to technical reasons, contemporary practice is  to combine this first stage of <I>kiddushin</I> - accomplished today by giving a ring- with the completion of the marriage ceremony. Yet in <I>halachah</I> <I>kiddushin</I> and <I>nissuin </I> are distinct events.)</P>

<P>The second <I>halachic</I> stage of marriage is <I>nissuin</I>. There is a dispute whether this is accomplished by standing under the <I>chupah</I>  or being together in the <I>yichud </I>room. It is after <I>nissuin</I> that the husband and wife become permitted to one another and at this point the mutual marital obligations  set in. </P>

<P>Following <I>nissuin</I> the third stage begins in the form of the week of <I>Sheva Berachot</I> - the joyful formal beginning of the couple's married life.</P>

<P>The three stages of development that took place as B<I>enei Yisrael </I>became <I>Am Hashem</I> correspond to the processes by which a man and woman are transformed into a happy married couple. <I>Yetziat Mitzrayim </I> is described by <I>Yirmiyahu</I> as the time of "<I>ahavat kelulotayich</I>" - the love of a bride. <I>Yetziat Mitzrayimi</I> was the <I>kiddushin</I>  between <I>Hashem</I> and <I>Benei Yisrael</I> , the initial commitment in the process of becoming <I>am Hashem</I>. This commitment was finalized by <I>kabbalat hatorah</I> - the moment of <I>nissuin</I> at which point <I>Benei Yisrael</I> became obligated to fulfill <I>Hashem</I>'s will, and in turn, <I>Hashem </I>"obligated" Himself to His nation. This parallels the way in which a husband and wife become responsible for one another at the moment of <I>nissuin</I>. </P>

<P>Following <I>kabbalat hatorah</I>, is the building of the <I>mishkan</I>, a dwelling for the <I>shechinah</I>,  The Ramban on the <I>parshah</I> explains that the primary purpose of the <I>mishkan</I> was to insure that the <I>maamad Har Sinai</I> experience would be everlasting. For this reason the central feature of the <I>mishkan</I> is the <I>aron</I> containing the <I>luchot</I>. A couple becomes one at <I>nissuin</I>, under the <I>chupah</I> or through <I>yichud</I>  - symbolic temporary homes. These temporary dwellings become permanent during the week of <I>Sheva Berachot</I> as the couple begins life together in a permanent setting.</P>

<P>This development of our relationship with <I>Hashem</I> was not merely an event of the past. Every year as we celebrate the <I>shalosh regalim</I> we relive theseexperiences. We are chosen by <I>Hashem </I> to be His bride during the <I>yom tov </I>of <I>Pesach</I>. We eagerly await our wedding which takes place on <I>Shavuot</I>. Finally, we celebrate our week of <I>sheva berachot</I> during <I>Succot</I> as we recreate the <I>mishkan</I> and the Clouds of Glory.</P>

<P>Each of the <I>yomim tovim</I> has a central theme. The essence of <I>Succot</I> is joy. Although there is a <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>simcha</I> on the other <I>regalim</I>, only <I>Succot</I> is defined as <I>zeman simchatenu</I>. On <I>Pesach</I> our joy is not complete because we have been chosen by <I>Hashem </I>but have not experienced dwelling with Him. On <I>Shavuot</I> we join <I>Hashem </I> at our "wedding", but the <I>chupah</I> of <I>Har Sinai</I> is only temporary. On <I>Succot</I> we celebrate life after the wedding. The true joy of marriage follows the wedding and is felt as the couple lives and grows together. The <I>Binyan HaMishkan</I> of old and the annual <I>Succot</I> are the true times of joy. It is only at these points that our relationship with <I>Hashem</I> has become permanent and this is our ultimate reason for rejoicing. May we merit to soon see the <I>Binyan Beit HaMikdash</I>, the culmination of our eternal relationship with <I>Hashem</I>. </P>

		<title><![CDATA[Physical and Spiritual Danger - the Legacy of Eisav</I>]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Zvi Sobolofsky]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2000]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vayishlach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>As Yaakov anticipates a dangerous reunion with Eisav, he calls out to Hashem for assistance. He beseeches Hashem to, "Rescue me from my brother, from Eisav". This prayer appears to be redundant since "my brother" <I>is</I> Eisav. The Beis HaLeivi commenst that Yaakov was actually asking Hashem for assistance in facing two different kinds of danger. Eisav poses as a physical threat to anyone he encounters when he appears as the personality of Eisav <I>HaRasha</I>. Yaakov had experienced this danger twenty years earlier when he was forced to flee for his life. Upon hearing that Eisav was coming to meet him with an army of four hundred men, Yaakov was presented with a very real threat of physical harm.</P>
<P>There was an entirely different danger that also frightened Yaakov. After so many years, perhaps Eisav had softened his position towards Yaakov. Could it be that Eisav was ready to approach Yaakov as a brother? Such a reunion posed an entirely different type of threat to the existence of Yaakov and his family. To become too close to a brother such as Eisav and expose his family to the lifestyle and values of an Eisav could spiritually destroy the foundation of the Jewish people. It was this dual danger that prompted Yaakov to request assistance in the manner that he did. "Rescue me from my borther", i.e. protect me from the dangers of a close relationship that could be spiritually devastating. "Rescue me from Eisav", i.e. protect me from physical harm that Eisav <I>HaRasha</I> may want to inflict upon me.</P>
<P>These two threats that faced Yaakov would constantly resurface through out Jewish history. There were times when the Jewish people faced the dangers of Eisav <I>HaRahsa</I>, the threat of physical annihilation. There were other times when the danger was subtler in the form of being lured into assimilation by those who appeared as our brothers.</P>
<P>Chanukah and Purim, the two festivals instituted by <I>Chazal</I> to commemorate the miraculous rescue of the Jewish People, celebrate two different aspect of our ongoing clash with the outside world. Our enemies at the time of Purim appeared as Eisav <I>HaRasha</I>, intent on physically destroying us. At the time of Chanukah, the assault against us was by those claiming to be "brothers" - by those who sought to befriend us by having us join their culture. In each instance the call to Hashem was different. "Rescue us from our brother" - save us from those who try to lure us into their lifestyle, "Rescue us from Eisav" - save us from those who try to annihilate us physically. Just as we constantly remain on guard against our physical enemies, let us remain on guard against our spiritual enemies and with <I>Siyata D'Shmaya</I> (heavenly help) be able to overcome all the dangers that may confront us.</P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>In <I>Parshas V'etchanan</I> the three <I>arei miklat</I>, the cities of refuge for the unintentional murderer, are designated on the east side of the <I>Yarden</I> (Jordan River). Upon the Jewish people's entering <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> proper, another three cities were to be set up on the west side of the Jordan. <I>Chazal</I> note that it is strange that the cities were divided evenly between both sides of the <I>Yarden</I> even though there were 9.5 <I>shevatim</I> (tribes) on one side and only 2.5 on the other. <I>Chazal</I>, in explaining this phenomenon, note that there were more murders that occurred on the east side of the <I>Yarden</I>, thereby necessitating a higher ration of <I>arei miklat</I> to people. What caused this phenomenon? What was it about this half of <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> that led to a laxity of concern for human life which lead to unintentional murders being more rampant?</P>
<P>The <I>halacha</I> is that a <I>rotzeach beshogeg</I> must remain in the <I>ir miklat</I> until the death of the <I>kohen gadol</I>. The Torah is telling us that there is some connection between the <I>chet</I> of <I>retzicha beshogeg</I> and the <I>kohen gadol</I>. </P>
<P>We find in other areas of <I>halacha</I> that the <I>Beit Hamikdash</I> embodies the antithesis of disregard for human life. For example, the Torah prohibits using stones touched by iron for the <I>mizbeach</I> because iron, which is used to form weapons, is responsible for loss of human life. If even an unintentional murder takes place it indicates that the <I>Beit Hamikdash</I> is not fulfilling its role. The <I>kohen gadol</I>, the guardian of the <I>Beit Hamikdash</I> is also at fault to a certain degree, and he too shares in the punishment of <I>rotzeach beshogeg</I>.</P>
<P>It is this role of the <I>Beit Hamikdash</I>- the preserving of human life - that may account for the laxity of attitude towards human life that existed on the east side of the <I>Yarden</I>, in that the <I>Beit Hamikdash</I> was on the far side of the river. The 2.5 <I>shevatim</I> that lived on the east side always felt a lack of closeness to the <I>Beit Hamikdash</I> because of the geographical separation that existed. In <I>Sefer Yehoshua</I>, residents of the east side of the <I>Yarden</I> constructed a <I>mizbeach</I> to remind their children of the <I>mishkan</I> and later the <I>Beit Hamikdash</I> that would built on the western side. This sense of distance led to deterioration in the value of human life, and carelessness that ultimately resulted in a higher rate of unintentional murder.</P>
<P> Furthermore, the <I>Beit Hamikdash</I> teaches us about the sanctity of life. The Ramban understands the aspect of <I>korbanot</I> as <I>kaparah</I> being the greatest affirmation of life. Based on strict justice, a person who sins should die. <I>Hashem</I> gives us a second chance at life upon entering the <I>Beit Hamikdash</I>. For this reason the <I>kohen</I> must be synonymous with life and distance himself from all contact with death. One who understands the inner message of the <I>Beit Hamikdash</I> has a greater appreciation of life, and learns to value it and treat it with greater care.</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: bechukosai]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>
<blockquote>
<I>'Im bechukosai telechu, vei-es mitzvosai tishmeru, veasisem osam</I>' (<I>Vayikra</I> 26:3) - If you walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

'Im bechukosai telechu</I>,' This bears on the text, I considered my ways, and turned my feet unto Your testimonies (<I>Tehllim</I> 119).<BR>
Rav Huna, in the name of Rav Acha expounded the verse to mean 'I considered' the reward given for good deeds and the loss entailed through misdeeds, 'and turned my feet unto your testimonies'. (<I>Vayikra</I> <I>Raba</I>)
</I>
</blockquote>
</P>

<P>The phrase, "<I>bechokosai telechu</I>" is suggestive; elsewhere (e.g., <I>Vayikra</I> 18:4, 26; 20:8) the Torah speaks of observance (<I>shemirah</I>) and performance (<I>asiyah</I>) of <I>chukim</I>. Accordingly, the <I>midrash</I> presents a variety of interpretations, each one prompted by the suggestive phraseology of our verse. </P>
<P>The <I>Yefeh Toar</I> commentary on the <I>midrash</I> amplifies Rav Acha's interpretation. The Torah's idiom, "<I>bechukosai</I> <I>telechu</I>" conveys a sense of progression and movement within Torah; a life of Torah and <I>mitzvos</I> is not static. It begins <I>shelo</I> <I>lishmah</I>, motivated by ulterior considerations such as attainment of reward. We ascend therefrom rung by rung, level by level, to even higher degrees of <I>avodas</I> <I>Hashem</I>. </P>
<P>In fact, both the Baal Shem Tov as well as Rav Hayim of Volozhin, commenting on the verse in Zechariah (3:7), "<I>venasati lecha mehalechim</I>", underscore man's spiritual mobility as his defining characteristic. Whereas angels are spiritually stationary, man is a <I>holech</I>/<I>mihalech</I>; he is spiritually mobile. </P>
<P>A Jew is called upon to live a life of continuous ascent. Accordingly, the Torah's exhortation of, "<I>bechokosai</I> <I>telechu</I>"; hence the imagery of the Psalmist: "Who will ascend the mountain of God?" (<I>Tehillim</I> 15) We must be aware that the demands of our daily routine can entrap us in a snare of complacency. We are very susceptible to exchanging a dynamic life of spiritual ascent for a static life upon a spiritual plateau. A life of ascent, <I>inter alia</I>, entails constantly deepening our commitment to Torah and Talmud Torah (if possible, quantitatively by devoting more time, but certainly qualitatively that Torah becomes increasingly central to our very being), pursuing <I>mitzvos</I> with zeal and striving for ethical-moral-religious perfection (<I>tikkun</I> <I>hamidos</I>). </P>
<P>The period of <I>sefiras</I> <I>haomer</I> is especially conducive to such ascent. As the generation of Jews who left Egypt ascended from the forty-nine gates of <I>tumah</I> during this time every year we too are offered a special opportunity for ascent in preparation for <I>kaballas</I> <I>hatorah</I>.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[Attaining Faith]]></title>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: beshalach]]></tag>

<P>"And the people feared Hashem, and they believed in Hashem and Moshe his servant"(1)</P>

<P>The Torah clearly and emphatically describes that Benei Yisroel attained <I>emunah</I> in the aftermath of kerias Yam Suf. The Midrash reinforces this point by commenting,</P>

<P>"And why is it necessary to mention <I>kerias Yam Suf</I> in <I>emes v'yatsiv</I>? Because once Hashem split the sea for them, they believed in Him, and in the merit of their belief they merited to say <I>shirah</I> and the <I>shekhinah</I> rested upon them"(2)</P>

<P>This, however, is puzzling. The entire process of redemption from Mitzrayim was an odyssey of <I>emunah</I>. When Moshe Rabbeinu first came to Bnei Yisroel, they responded with faith - "and the people believed"(3). They demonstrated profound <I>emunah</I> in reversing directions and heading back towards the onrushing Egyptian army. They did not question Moshe Rabbeinu, and, without provisions, simply followed him and Aharon into the vast desert wasteland. According to Chazal, the miracle of <I>kerias Yam Suf</I> happened in the merit of these remarkable manifestations of faith. "Hakadosh Baruch Hu said 'by virtue of the faith they have displayed in me, they are worthy that I should split the sea for them'"(4). Clearly Bnei Yisroel possessed and displayed <I>emunah</I> throughout. What dimension or level of <I>emunah</I> was attained only after <I>kerias Yam Suf</I>?</P>

<P>There are two levels of <I>emunah</I>. Fundamental <I>emunah</I>, itself deep and profound, entails belief in Hakadosh Baruch Hu as creator of the world and giver of the Torah. This belief may be fostered by parents and/or teachers, or perhaps may be the result of one's own intellectual quest. Moreover, such <I>emunah</I> must be manifest through <I>kabolas ol malchus Shomayim</I> and <I>ol mitzvos</I>. The Rambam identifies belief in <I>yichud Hashem</I> with the practical commitment of <I>kabolas ol malchus Shamayim</I> (5).</P>

<P>Such <I>emunah</I>, albeit eminently laudable, is lacking. It is an impersonal <I>emunah</I>. The higher level of faith is personal. It involves experiencing Hashem - not only believing in Him, but feeling His presence. At this level, <I>emunah</I> is not merely intellectual, but experiential as well.</P>

<P>This personal, experiential level of faith was attained after <I>kerias Yam Suf</I>. Chazal express this idea inter alia in their comment that, "everyone ascending from the sea pointed with his finger and said 'this is my God and I shall glorify Him"(6). In parshas Shemos, Moshe Rabbeinu was instructed to inform Bnei Yisroel that, "Hashem the God of your ancestors appeared to me, the God of Avaraham, Yitzchok and Ya'akov" (7). After <I>kerias Yam Suf</I>, the Jews pointed and said, "this is my God". The higher level of <I>emunah</I> had been attained.</P>

<P>The pasuk and medrash point to two corrolaries of this singular attainment. Bnei Yisroel were now able to say <I>shirah</I> because while praise may be recited in an indirect, impersonal manner, <I>shirah</I> necessitates immediacy and intimacy. Moreover, having themselves experienced Hakadosh Baruch Hu, Bnei Yisroel now appreciated the uniqueness of Moshe Rabbeinu's ongoing intense and intimate relationship with Hashem. Hence, "they believed in Hashem and Moshe his servant".</P>

<P>In our personal lives we must strive to tRavel this same trail of faith culminating in experiencing Hashem. To achieve this goal we must be <I>mevakshei</I> Hashem in every aspect of our lives. Inter alia this entails studying Torah and observing mitzvos not only to fulfill Hashem's commandments, but also as instruments of achieving <I>deveikus</I>(8). Moreover, we have to be sensitive to the <I>hashgachah pratis</I> which permeates our lives. Such commitment and sensitivity will d.v. allow us to become <I>ba'alei emunah</I>.</P>

<hr align=left size=1 width="33%">

<P>(1) Shemos 14:31</P>
<P>(2) Shemos Raba 22:3</P>
<P>(3) Shemos 4:31. According to one opinion in the Medrash (Shemos Raba 23:1), Bnei Yisroel regressed after their initial demonstration of faith, and at Yam Suf they regained their faith. Even according to this view, however, it's absolutely clear that their regained emunah which encompassed Moshe Rabbeinu as well was qualitatively different.</P>

<P>(8) The text of <I>elokai netzor</I> as it appears in our text in maseches Berachos (17a) is <I>u-ve-mitzvosecha tirdof nafshi</I>. The prepositional letter be (or ve) signifies the instrument, not the object of pursuit. Hence the correct understanding is may my soul pursue You, Hakadosh Baruch Hu, through observance of your mitsvos.</P>

<P><blockquote>The <I>Amora</I>, <I>Rav</I> Achi, said: The conversation of the slaves of the Patriarchs is more pleasing before the Omnipresent than the Torah of their descendants, for the episode of Eliezer's quest for a wife for Isaac is doubled in the Torah while many essential elements of the Torah were given only by allusion (<I>Bereishis rabbah</I> 60:8).</blockquote></P>

<I><P>Rav </I>Nissan Alpert <I>z</I>"<I>l </I>explained beautifully this cryptic Ravnic statement. The Torah is very expansive in telling and re-telling the story of Eliezer ("the conversation of the slaves of the Patriarchs") because of its subject matter; it teaches us about the religious personality of a Jew- specifically, <I>chessed</I>. In this pedagogic realm, concise, logical explanations, entirely adequate in other realms of Torah ("the Torah of their descendants"), do not suffice. Anecdotal, inspirational illustrations are also necessary. Hence, due to the difference in subject matter, the Torah devotes more space to the "conversation of the slaves", than to the "Torah of [the] descendants."</P>
<P>Similarly, added <I>Rav</I> Alpert, in the annals of <I>gedolei yisroel</I> we encounter differing pedagogic styles. The writings of the Vilna Gaon, for example, are characterized by their compactness and brevity. Chassidic lore, on the other hand, is replete with stories. The difference in styles was dictated by the respective subject matters. The Chassidic masters, in the tradition of Eliezer, focused on the religious personality and duties of the heart- faith, trust in <I>Hashem</I>, etc. These matters must be taught expansively. The glosses of the Vilna Gaon<I> </I>to <I>Shulchan Aruch</I>, primarily focusing on the minutiae of <I>halachah,</I> did not necessitate such elaboration (1).</P>
<P>Let us further develop this distinction. Minutiae of <I>halachah</I> are vitally important; accordingly, we must initially study them, and subsequently review in order to retain that knowledge. <I>Halachic </I>teachings regarding faith, trust in <I>Hashem</I>, <I>chessed</I>, etc demand even more (2). In addition to mastery and retention we have to internalize these teachings and beliefs; faith is incomplete if we only know the tenets of Judaism. Similarly, <I>chessed</I>, without being internalized can only be inadequately practiced; our personalities must be suffused with and defined by <I>chessed</I>. </P>
<P>The transition from knowledge to internalization demands constant review and incessant reinforcement. Reinforcement upon reinforcement. This process, in our overly intellectualized climate of learning, seems alien and is oft times neglected. We study to master something new, to expand our horizons. Per force we review so that our horizons should not become constricted due to forgetfulness. But, once these aims have been achieved, it seems unproductive to undertake further review. Why review again what one already knows and has retained when one could study something new?</P>
<I><P>Parshas Chayei Sarah </I>provides the resounding answer. The Torah tells and retells the story of Eliezer and its lessons of <I>chessed</I> to teach us that we must learn and constantly reinforce in order to internalize such teachings.</P>
<P>The need for and ramifications of internalizing religious, moral, or ethical teachings also warrants some elaboration. Obviously, the present forum does not allow for a comprehensive presentation. Let us, however, focus, albeit briefly and inadequately, on the topic of <I>chessed</I>. </P>
<P>Man is naturally a self-centered being. This inclination, like any divinely implanted inclination or instinct, is very important for <I>Hashem</I>'s plan for the world. Our self-centeredness contains the instinct for self-survival and desire to live; "He did not create the world to be desolate; [rather] He formed it to be inhabited. (3)" "And a person shall live through mitzvos and not die on their account."(4) Our self-centeredness allows us in our service of <I>Hashem</I> to be initially motivated by ulterior considerations of reward and punishment. This motivation is necessary and thus the susceptibility crucial; "a person should be preoccupied with Torah and mitzvos [even] for ulterior motives, because this will lead to pure motivation". (5)<BR>
</P>
<P>As is true of all instincts, self-centeredness has to be refined. We should allow it to flourish in the form of desiring life, but we cannot allow it to deteriorate into crass, crude egotism.</P>
<P>A <I>chesed</I>-oriented personality is attuned to other people's sensitivities and needs, not merely his own. Crude egotism has ceded to altruism, whereby he feels that he lives not for himself, but to serve <I>Hashem</I>, and an integral part of that service is helping others. Such a <I>chesed</I> personality recognizes opportunities for and occasions of <I>chesed</I> and extending courtesy which a self-centered personality could never discern.</P>
<P>The story is told of a poor woman who before the holiday of <I>Pesach</I> came to Rav Yosef Dov HaLevi Soloveitchik, the Beis HaLevi, and inquired if she could use milk in lieu of wine for the four cups. The Beis HaLevi gently answered in the negative, and proceeded to give her a large sum of money. After the woman departed, the Beis HaLevi's intimates who had witnessed this scene queried why a foolish question had prompted him to give a large sum of money. Rav Soloveitchik responded that this destitute woman did not know if milk could be used for the four cups. However, she surely knew that one does not drink milk soon after eating meat. Clearly then she is so poor that she can afford neither wine nor meat. Accordingly, I provided funds for her <I>yom tov</I> expenses.</P>
<P>This story is often told to highlight the genius of the Beis HaLevi. The real point of the story, however, is his sensitivity. Instead of being irked by the woman's "foolish" question, Rav Soloveitchik was attuned to her unspoken suffering.</P>
<P>One who is content to merely practice <I>chesed</I> from a self-centered perspective is incapable of recognizing such occasions for <I>chesed</I>. Similarly, only one possessing a <I>chesed</I> personality will have the sensitivity to measure his actions by their effect on others, not just on himself. To cite a trivial example, when compelled to leave a <I>shul</I> or <I>Beis Medrash</I> in the midst of <I>tefillah</I> or a <I>shiur</I>, a <I>chesed</I> personality will ensure that the door closes quietly so as to not cause a disturbance.</P>
<P>A <I>chesed</I> personality will never use people. When he asks a favor or advice, he will feel and communicate his gratitude. A self-centered personality will not hesitate to impose in seeking help, but will not take the time to follow up afterwards and inform his mentor or benefactor how things developed.</P>
<P>In sum, <I>chesed</I> needs to be internalized; otherwise it cannot even be adequately practiced. For this reason the Torah reinforces the conversation of the slaves because reinforcement upon reinforcement is the method of internalization.</P>

		<content><![CDATA[


<P>"For you to pass into the covenant of <I>Hashem</I>, your God, and into his imprecation that <I>Hashem</I>, your God, seals with you today." (1)</P>
<P>The covenant (<I>bris</I>) which <I>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</I> established with <I>Benei Yisrael</I>  in <I>Arvos Moav</I> is sealed with an imprecation. God forbid, in forsaking the Torah, we not only incur punishment, but also the consequences of that curse. The threat of dire punishment is certainly as powerful a deterrent as can be, even without that punishment being presented in the form of an imprecation. What then is the purpose and significance of the curse?</P>
<P>The answer to this question requires an understanding of the concept of <I>bris </I>(2). What does a <I>bris</I> entail? When nations form a defense alliance or pact they are pledging to defend one another. In other words, their national interests merge. An attack on one is viewed and responded to as an attack on both. In a more profound vein, when a man and woman enter into a covenant of marriage their separate destinies merge into one. They are bound to each other, </P>
<P>This is also the Torah's understanding of <I>bris</I>. Our <I>bris</I> with <I>Hashem</I> was established, " in order to establish you today as a people to Him, and that he be a God to you. (3)" The core of our existence is that we are <I>Hashem</I>'s people; and reciprocally He is our God (4). We are bound to Him, and he to us. That is, he reveals Himself to the world through us. </P>
<P>For this reason the Torah employs the idiom kerisas bris, "cutting a covenant". As explained by Rashi (1), this idiom reflects the practice of establishing a covenant by cutting an animal in half, and having the <I>committed</I> parties pass through. The passage through the bifurcated animal signifies that the <I>baalei bris</I> are bound to each other; each one is but half, needing the other to be whole.</P>
<P>Let us now examine the concept of curse. What triggers a curse? When is this dire response appropriate? <I>Noach</I> cursed the descendants of his son <I>Chom</I>. <I>Chom</I> did not simply sin against <I>Noach</I>. When a son takes evil advantage of his father's vulnerability, he <U>betrays</U> filial obligations and paternal trust.</P>
<P>Sin elicits punishment. Betrayal results in curse.</P>
<P>Similarly, the serpent abused the blessing of cunning bestowed upon him by <I>Hakadosh</I> <I>Baruch Hu.</I> This betrayal of trust occasioned imprecation.</P>
<P>This too is the significance of the imprecation associated with forsaking <I>Hashem</I> and His Torah. We are bound to Him and He to us by a <I>bris</I>. Thus, to forsake <I>Hashem</I> is not only to sin but to betray His trust, His <I>bris</I> with us. </P>
<P>Paradoxically yet intentionally, the imprecation of <I>Arvos Moav</I> underscores the great awesome bond  we share with <I>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</I>, and our resultant tremendous spiritual potential and responsibility. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<OL>
<I><LI>Devarim</I> 29:11</LI>
<LI>The understanding of <I>bris</I> presented here is a superficial summary of a profound analysis of that concept by my esteemed brother shlit"a.</LI>
<I><LI>Devarim</I> 29:12</LI>
<LI>See Rashi to <I>Bamidbar</I> 10:35. Those who hate <I>Benei Yisroel, eo ipso</I>, hate Hashem.</LI></OL>

		<title><![CDATA[<I>Bamidbar</I> and <I>Shavuos</I>]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Mordechai Willig]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2000]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: bamidbar]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<I><P>Parshas Bamidbar</I> is always read just before <I>Shavuos</I>. The <I>medrash</I> provides several connections between the very first <I>pasuk</I> in <I>Bamidbar</I> and <I>kabbalas</I> <I>hatorah</I>:</P>
<I><P>Hashem</I> spoke to Moshe in the desert to teach us that one who does not transform himself into a "desert"- something hefker, can not acquire wisdom and Torah. The connection between humility and Torah acquisition is found in a number of Talmudic passages. The <I>Gemara</I> (<I>Eruvin</I> 54a) states that one who makes himself like a desert, which all can step on, is given Torah as a gift. Rashi explains that such a quality indicates a lack of arrogance. Another similar passage is found in the Talmudic prayer (<I>Brachot</I> 17a) with which we conclude the <I>amida</I>. "May my soul be like dust"- which everyone can step on- "Open my heart to Your Torah." A final example is a passage (<I>Pesachim</I> 66b) that states that humility is a prerequisite for true Torah knowledge, and haughtiness can cause wisdom to be lost.</P>
<I><P>Hashem</I> confined His revelation to Moshe, speaking to him from within the tent (<I>Ohel Moed</I>), because modesty is beautiful. The proof text, "and walk humbly <U>with</U> your God" (<I>Micha</I> 6:8), shows that <I>Hashem</I>, too, walks humbly and modestly. The honor of Torah itself, referred to as the <I>bas melech</I>, the child of Moshe the king, is inward -"<I>Pnima</I>".  (Tehilim 45:14).</P>
<P>The beauty of modesty (<I>tznius</I>) is cited by Rashi (<I>Shmot</I> 34:3) in the context of <I>Kabalas HaTorah</I> itself. The first <I>luchos</I> (tablets), which were given publicly, with great noise and fanfare, were overcome by the evil eye, and destroyed. The permanence of the second <I>luchos</I> (tablets) which were given privately to Moshe, demonstrates that nothing is more beautiful than modesty.</P>
<P>As we read <I>Bamidbar</I> and prepare for <I>Shavuos</I> and our own personal <I>Kabalas</I> <I>Hatorah</I>, we should look at our own great Torah scholars and leaders as role models. It is no coincidence that our greatest sage, Moshe <I>Rabbeinu</I>, was also the humblest man who ever lived.</P>
<P>Even if we realize our smallness compared to Torah giants of then and now, we often fail to be <I>hefker lakol</I>, to treat those less accomplished than ourselves with proper respect. This failure to emulate Moshe <I>Rabbeinu</I> and <I>gedolei Yisroel</I> who cared for and respected the common man prevents us from acquiring Torah to the best of our ability and capacity.</P>
<P>We must learn from Hashem Himself and walk modestly with Him. As He modestly hides His greatness, so too, we must avoid flaunting our accomplishments. Indeed, modesty in our actions is a reflection of humility in our hearts.</P>
<P>These timeless lessons take on a greater sense of urgency in our world of publicity seekers and conspicuous consumption. These ills which have affected the Jewish world at large have also permeated the Torah world. If we think and act with the lessons of <I>medrash Bamidbar</I>, we will be blessed with a greater measure of <I>kabbalas hatorah</I>.</P>

		<date><![CDATA[2000]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: lechlecha]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Medrash (39:7) relates that Avraham was afraid to leave Terach because people would say he left his aging father, and this would cause a <I>chilul Hashem</I>. Hashem responded, "<I>Lech <U>lecha</I></U>" (12:1), I exempt you ("<I>lecha</I>") from <I>kibud av</I>, but nobody else. And I will record Terach's death before your journey.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Maharal (Rashi 11:32) explains the uniqueness of Avraham's circumstance and the "death" of Terach as follows. Since Avraham began an entirely new era when he left Terach, his connection to Terach was completely severed. Therefore, Hashem exempted him, and only him, from <I>kibud av</I>, and emphasized the total break by viewing Terach as dead before Avraham's journey to <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This <I>Medrash</I> corroborates the <I>Rambam</I>'s view (<I>Mamrim</I> 6:11) that one must honor a parent who is a <I>rasha</I>. According to the <I>Tur</I> (Yoreh Deah 240: 18), a <I>rasha</I> need not be honored by his son and Avraham was not unique at all. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <I>Tur </I>proves his position from the Gemara (<I>Bava Kamma</I> 94b) which states that a son, after his father's death, does not have to repay interest that his father accrued over his lifetime. Chizkiyahu's shabby treatment of his <I>rasha</I> father's body, which <I>Chazal</I> endorsed (<I>Pesachim </I>56a), also support's the <I>Tur's</I> view.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To defend the <I>Rambam</I>, we must assume that <I>kibbud av</I> contains an interpersonal (<I>bein adam lechavero</I> ) component (see <I>Minchas Chinuch </I>No.33). However, this <I>bein adam lechavero</I> aspect applies only while the father is alive (see <I>Maharam Schick</I>, Y.D. 218). The obligation to honor a deceased parent (<I>Kiddushin</I> 31b) is purely <I>bein adam lamakom.</I> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <I>Ramban</I> (<I>Shmos</I> 20:12) suggests that <I>kibbud av</I> is included in the honor of <I>Hashem</I> because parents are <I>Hashem</I>'s partner in creation (<I>Kiddushin 30b).</I> Therefore, a <I>rasha</I>, who is unworthy of being treated as <I>Hashem</I>'s partner, is excluded from the <I>bein adam lamakom </I>dimension of <I>kibbud av</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, the <I>Rambam</I> requires one to honor a parent who is a <I>rasha</I> only because of the <I>bein adam lachavero</I> component. But because interpersonal obligations do not apply to one who died, one need not honor a deceased <I>rasha</I>. Hence, the <I>Gemara</I> (<I>Bava Kamma, Pesachim</I>) refers to a dead parent, while the <I>Rambam</I> refers to a <I>rasha</I> who is still alive.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <I>Gemara</I> (<I>Kiddushin</I> 31b) relates that R. Assi left <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> to greet his mother. When he discovered that she had died and her coffin was coming, he said, "Had I known I would not have left." Why would he not have left? Isn't attending a parent's funeral a fulfillment of <I>kibbud av</I>?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A more basic question can be raised. How was R. Assi permitted to leave? <I>Tosfos</I> (<I>Avodah Zarah</I> 13a) permits leaving <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> only to learn Torah or to get married. In fact, the issue of leaving <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> for <I>kibbud av</I> is disputed by the <I>poskim</I> (<I>Pischei Teshuvah, Even Haezer</I> 75:6, <I>Yechave Daas</I> 3:69)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps, the <I>bein adam lamakom</I> aspect of <I>kibbud av</I> does not warrant leaving <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>, as <I>Tosfos </I>implies. Therefore once Rav Asi discovered that his mother had died, and only the <I>bein adam lamakom</I> aspect of <I>kibud av</I> remained intact, he no longer had any justification to leave <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>. However, just as one is required to pay a personal debt, even if as a result he must leave <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>, so too one must repay his debt to his parents (see <I>Chinuch</I> #33) and honor them even by leaving <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>. Therefore, R. Assi was permitted to leave <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> to honor his mother- a <I>bein adam lechavero</I> obligation. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we equate remaining outside <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> with leaving it, there is further proof that <I>kibud av</I> overrides living in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> from the Medrash. Only Avraham was exempted from kibud av to live in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>, as derived from<I> </I>Lech <U>Lecha</U><I>. </I>All others must honor even a rasha father, even if as a result the <I>mitzva</I> of living in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> cannot be fulfilled. </P>

		<title><![CDATA[Pinchas, <I>Bris Mila</I>, and Parenting]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Mordechai Willig]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2000]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: pinchas]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>Every bris begins with the first three <I>pesukim</I> of <I>Parshas </I>Pinchas, which describe the heroism of Pinchas, and the subsequent reward of "<I>bris</I> <I>shalom</I>." Why were these <I>pesukim</I> chosen? Let us examine the background of this story.</P>
<P>"And now I will advise you," (24:14). Rashi, citing Sanhedrin (106a), tells us what Bilaam's advice to Balak was: Since Hashem hates promiscuity, induce the Israelite men to sin. This strategy, attributed to Bilaam (31:16) proved successful and caused 24,00 to die in a plague (25:1,9). The zealous act of Pinchas halted the plague by turning back Hashem's anger, and earned Pinchas the covenant of peace (25:7-12).</P>
<P>Why was Bilaam's strategy successful at this particular time, a point alluded to by his opening word, "<I>veata</I>" (and now)? Rav C.Y. Goldvicht, <I>z"l</I>, answered this question based on Rashi (23:8) who quotes Sanhedrin (105b), saying that Bilaam's power was that he knew the precise moment that Hashem is angry each day. This is a difficult answer to understand because, on the days that Bilaam came to Balak, we don't see Hashem getting angry at all.</P>
<P>Now, anger is generally a negative attribute. Why then does Hashem exhibit anger every day? Apparently, anger, which is a manifestation of strict justice (<I>din</I>) and strength (<I>gevurah</I>), is necessary, albeit in very small measure, to create a balance in the heavens with Hashem's dominant attribute of kindness (<I>chessed</I>). </P>
<P>An unchecked overabundance of <I>chessed</I> can lead to immorality (<I>arrayos</I>) (Vayikra 20:17). Bilaam was frustrated at the complete absence of Hashem's anger for many days, which prevented him from cursing <I>Am Yisroel</I>. He sensed that the lack of  anger created an imbalance, on overabundance of <I>chessed</I>, which would make people more susceptible to the temptations of immorality. Thus, his cunning, and successful advice that <U>now</U> was the right time to entice the men of <I>Am Yisrael</I> to commit a sin which is a perversion of <I>chessed</I>.</P>
<P>To this interpretation of the Rosh Yeshiva <I>z"l</I>, one may add the following. Why was Hashem's anger so powerful as to threaten the very existence of our people and how did an act of Pinchas quell this anger? Perhaps there was, <I>kivyachol</I>, a measure of pent up anger because of all the days when no anger was shown. This posed a great threat when the men of <I>Am Yisroel</I> succumbed to the sin of <I>zenus</I>.</P>
<P>Pinchas is introduced as the grandson of Aharon, who personified love and the pursuit of peace. When he, of all people, overcame his inherited predisposition to avoid controversy, and zealously avenged the crime on behalf of Hashem, the balance was restored and Hashem's anger abated.</P>
<P>The reward that Pinchas received, "<I>brisi sholom</I>", seems inappropriate for an act of violence. In reality, however, a peace of no principles cannot stand. Pinchas, by fighting for principle, and by utilizing an attribute that was antithetical to his personality and up bringing, achieved true <I>sholom</I>.</P>
<P>At every <I>bris</I>, a father overcomes his innate, overwhelming and unconditional love of his son, and performs, by proxy, what has been called a barbaric act. Thus the appropriate introduction to the <I>bris</I> is the similar, though much more heroic and dramatic, action of Pinchas. Perhaps the parallel of "<I>brisi sholom</I>", the reward for Pinchas, is the proper balance of discipline and unconditional love required for successful parenting.</P>
<P>The Rambam (<I>Moreh Nevuchim</I> 3:49) suggests that a reason for <I>bris milah</I> is the curbing of male desire, which enables a Jewish man to resist the temptation of immorality. If so, the introduction of Pinchas' zealousness is directly on point. As noted earlier, the males of <I>Am Yisroel</I> sinned because the balance of <I>chesed</I> and <I>gevura</I> was impaired by the absence of Hashem's anger. Pinchas' zealousness restored the balance and saved us from Hashem's wrath.</P>
<P>Similarly, a <I>bris</I>, according to the Rambam, is necessary to achieve a proper balance to ensure that the powerful male <I>yetzer hora</I> be held in check. Therefore, the <I>pesukim</I> describing how Pinchas achieved this critical balance are quoted as the appropriate introduction to each <I>bris milah</I>.</P>
<P>In our times, society has lost its sense of balance and proportion in these areas. Parenting in America avoids placing limitations on the activities of children. In Israel, spanking a misbehaved youngster, a biblically and talmudically sanctioned act (see Mishlei (13:24) and Makkos 8A), has been criminalized by the court. While overly restricting a child is inadvisable, and hitting too hard of too often is prohibited, the nearly total absence of discipline has led to a situation in which the traditional balance of child rearing has been lost. </P>
<P>The decadence and permissiveness of modern society poses a threat to all of our children. At a <I>bris</I>, when we involve the <I>pesukim</I> describing Pinchas's act and its reward we should be mindful of the lessons that apply to all generations. By learning these lessons and acting upon them, parents can raise their children in the traditional, balanced way and thereby be blessed, as was Pinchas, with the <I>bracha</I> of peace, <I>shalom</I>. </P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: shmini]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The medrash in the opening <I>pasuk</I> of <I>Parshat Shemini</I> compares <I>Ziknei Yisrael</I> (elders of Israel, i.e. Torah leaders) with the wings of a bird: just as a bird cannot fly without wings, <I>Yisrael</I> can not do anything without their <I>Zikeynim</I>. (Yife Toar explains that this refers to the fact that the advice of Torah scholars is followed by Am Yisrael.)</P>
<P>The notion of Torah knowledge imparting to the scholar that learns <I>lishmah</I> the ability to offer wise counsel that individuals can benefit from is found in the <I>beraita</I> of Kinyan Torah (Avot 6:1). The medrash extends the principle to <I>Klal Yisrael</I>, the Jewish community as a whole.</P>
<P>Advice is, by definition, not binding. One who seeks Ravnic advice and chooses to ignore it does not violate <I>halachah</I>. Indeed, if he is convinced, based on superior information , that the Rav has erred, he should ignore the advice. Many Ravs do not offer specific counsel when the expertise of others in a particular area exceeds their own. Instead, they advise the questioner to follow the opinion of an expert in the field.</P>
<P>The possibility that the greatest of scholars can err in strict <I>halachah</I> is explicit in Vayikra (4:13 see Rashi). Even in that case, an individual who is convinced that the <I>Sanhedrin</I> erred may not rely on their decision (Horayot 2b).</P>
<P>The Talmud (Gittin 56b) cites the view of Rav Akiva that Rav Yochanan ben Zakai, the greatest Torah leader of his day, erred grievously in a political decision equivalent to advice for <I>Klal Yisrael</I>. While it is true that the Talmud defends Rav Yochanan ben Zakai's view, and, assuming it is wrong, attributes it to divine intervention which confounded the wisdom of a <I>chacham</I>, nonetheless, the principle of Ravnic fallibility is extended from pure <I>halachah</I> to more general matters.</P>
<P>This exception does not detract from the idea of the medrash cited earlier. Just as in <I>halachah</I> we must follow Ravnic rulings, despite the possibility of error rather than lapse into <I>halachic</I> anarchy (see Sefer HaChinuch, 496) so too in the realm of advice, both personal and communal, we do well by adhering to the counsel of <I>Ziknei Yisrael</I>, even though it is sometimes wrong.</P>
<P>In his eulogy for R. Chaim Ozer z"l, the Rav z"l noted that a Torah leader whose life was devoted to <I>halachic</I> learning and decisions could be relied upon for solutions to political and worldly matters  (Divrei Hagut VeHaaracha p.192).</P>
<P>Ironically, the great rabbanim of that very era were criticized for offering bad advice that led to terrible consequences during the Holocaust. The proper resolution is that while Torah confers great insight on general matters to those who pursue it <I>lishmah</I> and master it, mistakes, both large and small, do exist and at times are caused by divine intervention confounding the wise.</P>
<P>Between the body specific <I>halachot</I>, codified in the <I>Shulchan Aruch</I>, and <I>poskim</I> for all generations, and the realm of advice referred to in the medrash, there is a third area: this includes matters which are of a <I>halchic</I> nature, but go beyond specific rules of classical <I>psak</I>. Some have referred to this domain as public policy, a term borrowed from the lexicon of secular law. Some Ravs have defended their refusal to submit to the opinion of acknowledged Torah giants on the grounds that on such issues there is no Ravnic authority. Of course, if this is true, laymen are free to reject the opinions of their Ravs as well.</P>
<P>However, this domain is not limited to public affairs. <I>Rabbanim</I> have traditionally ruled on such matters for both individuals and communities and their rulings were considered as authoritative as any <I>psak</I> in specific ritual or civil law.</P>
<P>A European <I>Rav</I> prohibited the introduction of Reform innovations in his <I>kehilla</I>. His <I>psak</I> was accepted even though no technical violation of a particular paragraph of the <I>Shulchan</I> <I>Aruch</I> occurred. Even in private matters, more difficult to enforce or document, most of those who adhered to the <I>Rav's psak</I> on a strict <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> matter followed his more general <I>halachic</I> decisions.</P>
<P>Thus, these decisions should be referred to as <I>halachic</I> policy and as in other areas, the <I>Ziknei Yisrael</I> should be the ones to decide the matter. Moreover, if one submits a question of this nature to a Rav he is bound by the decision which is not merely advice. </P>
<P>With the breakdown of the <I>kehilla</I> system, the decisions of <I>rabannim</I> are not as binding in <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> matters or general <I>halachic</I> matters. Different opinions, sometimes both valid, can coexist in the same community, in both realms, and proper respect should be demonstrated for the view of another. However, in principle, there is the idea that greater Torah knowledge in the specifics of <I>Shas</I> and <I>poskim</I> confers greater authority on matters of <I>halachic</I> policy, and that authority must be accepted.</P>
<P>In the world of Modern Orthodoxy this acceptance is far from universal. American culture, which objects to submission to authority, and the greater tolerance for opposing views, in all <I>halachic</I> areas, generally shown by the Torah scholars of this community have combined to create the illusion that, if no specific classical text is violated, anything goes. This mistaken impression is a gRave danger to this community as such and individuals and families that belong to it.</P>
<P>Of course, the principle of rabinnic fallibility applies here as well. Moreover, in <I>halachic</I> policy matters, conditions and nuances can change and lead to different decisions. But, as in the other areas, communities and individuals should look to the Torah scholars of their time, place, and broadly defined community for proper leadership. If this is done, then as the medrash teaches, those who follow can soar to greater heights in all aspects of life.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Remember what Hashem did to Miriam" (Devarim 24:9). "If you wish to avoid <I>tzora'as</I>, don't speak <I>lashon hara</I> (as Miriam did)" (Rashi ibid.). The <I>meraglim</I> saw the punishment of Miriam, but failed to learn a lesson from it. For this reason, the story of the <I>meraglim</I> is found right after the story of Miriam (Rashi, Bamidbar 13:1). What lesson should the <I>meraglim</I> have learned from Miriam; their sin was not <I>lashon hara</I>, but <I>motze shem ra</I> on an inanimate object, <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> (13:32, see Onkelos)?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Miriam had discovered that Moshe abstained from relations with his wife, and related this fact to Aharon (Rashi 12:1). They said, "Hashem spoke to us too, yet we have not abstained from marital relations" (Rashi 12:2). For this Miriam was punished, even though she did not intend to speak badly of Moshe (Rashi 12:1). Hashem tells Miriam and Aharon that He had told Moshe to abstain (Rashi 12:8), He becomes angry and afflicts Miriam with <I>tzara'as</I> (12:9,10).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Miriam's basic mistake was the misinterpretation of the facts. She thought that Moshe had decided on his own to abstain, and she questioned his decision. In reality, however, Moshe was commanded to do so. Miriam's <I>lashon hara</I> was caused by her incorrect understanding of a situation that she had discovered.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <I>meraglim</I> made a similar mistake. They described <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> as a land that devours its inhabitants (13:32). Wherever they went, they saw burials, so they assumed that it is extremely dangerous to live there (Rashi). In reality, Hashem arranged for numerous deaths and burials for the forty days the <I>meraglim</I> were in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> in order to preoccupy the natives of the land with their mourning so that they should not detect the <I>meraglim</I>. At all other times, <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> was not dangerous at all.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lesson that the <I>meraglim</I> should have learned from Miriam was the need to be certain about the facts before criticizing a person or a land. Miriam could have asked Moshe, or perhaps even Hashem, why he abstained. The <I>meraglim</I> could have asked Moshe, or perhaps even Hashem, why so many people died in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>. Instead, based on their misinterpretation of the facts, they criticized Moshe and <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <I>meraglim</I> were punished by death (14:37) because they persisted in their attempt to enlist all of <I>Am Yisroel</I> in their campaign to besmirch <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> (14:36). The best efforts of Kalev and Yehoshua to refute them failed (13:30, 14:6-9) and led to threats to their lives (14:10).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why didn't Moshe simply explain to the people that the numerous deaths in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> were an aberration caused by Hashem to avoid the detection of the <I>meraglim</I> by its inhabitants? Apparently, once the negative impression of the land took hold in the people's minds, it was impossible to uproot. Such is the power of negative speech about a person or land, that it is difficult, if not impossible, to rectify.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are commanded to remember what happened to Miriam. We dare not repeat the mistake of negative speech based on incorrect facts or interpretations, nor may we accept as absolute truth such negative reports. This mistake led to the destruction of the <I>Mikdosh</I> and the crying for generations (Ta'anis 29a). Only by correcting it can we be worthy of the ultimate redemption.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[Parshat Yitro - Torah and Secular Studies]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Mordechai Willig]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2000]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: yisro]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>In <I>Parshat Yitro</I> we read about <I>kabbalat hatorah</I>. The centrality of <I>limmud hatorah</I>, and its relationship with the need for <I>parnasah</I> are issues which face all of us. For individuals who are planning careers the question is: Are secular studies permissible for everyone when they are necessary to provide for a livelihood? The answer is: for almost everyone.</P>
<P>The Gemara presents a disagreement between Rav Yishmael and Rav Shimon bar Yochai (Rashbi). Rashbi says a person should learn Torah the entire day and somehow he will find a way to support himself and his family. Rav Yishmael disagrees and maintains that a person is required to act in accordance with the verse, "<I>veasafta deganecha vetirashcha veyitzharecha</I>" (Deut. 11:14) in order to fulfill the will of Hashem. As Rav Yishmael puts it: <I>hanheg bahen minhag derech eretz</I>- a person should combine Torah with <I>derech eretz</I>. Literally, <I>derech eretz</I> means "the way of the world," which, in this context means earning a <I>parnasah</I> (<I>Berachot </I>35b).</P>
<P>Admittedly, in those days, <I>parnasah</I> did not mean attending a university. The phrase, "<I>veasafta deganecha</I>", clearly refers to earning a livelihood through farming. Nevertheless, this can be extended beyond simply farming since, even during the time of the Talmud, it was not limited to that. A "strict constructionist" may argue that Rav Yishmael limited his opinion only to farming and did not allow one to be a shoemaker or a tailor, for example. It would seem, however, that Rav Yishmael's opinion is that one may study in order to earn a living, however that may be defined. In fact, not only is it permissible according to Rav Yishmael ; it is advisable. And, without giving a formal <I>pesak</I> the Gemara seems to follow this opinion by citing the famous remark following this controversy: <I>Amar Abaye harbeh asu keRebbi Yishmael vealta beyadan, keRebbi Shimon ben Yochai velo alta beyadan</I>. Many followed the approach of Rav Yishmael and succeeded; while those who followed the approach of Rashbi  did not succeed. One could therefore, conclude, that secular studies; at least in the context of enabling one to make a living are not for everyone. </P>
<P>The <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> presents all the laws relating to a Jew's daily schedule starting from waking in the morning through <I>davening Shacharit</I> and eating breakfast. It then continues, <I>"achar cach yelech leoskav dechol torah sheein imma melachah sofah betelah vegoreret avon." </I> Clearly it is important for everyone to have a <I>parnasah</I>. It is true that the <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> continues, "<I>umikol makom lo yaaseh melachto ikar elah arai vetorato keva vezeh yitkayem beyado.</I>" This is a quotation from the aforecited Gemara that a person is obligated to consider Torah as his main preoccupation, and <I>parnasah</I> related activities as his secondary occupation. Torah is the <I>ikar</I>; <I>parnasah</I> is the <I>tafel</I>. Nevertheless, it is clear from both the Gemara and the <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> that a person has an obligation to make a living. The <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> lists no exceptions to this rule. It would therefore seem that, in this context, secular studies are for everyone. To be sure, this does not mean that every person is required to engage in study. For example, someone could be a successful businessman, invest in the stock market and make a fortune - all without secular studies. If that is how one wants to make a living, that is his option. But if one decides to make a living through a trade or a profession which requires a certain level of secular studies, it would seem that, based on the <I>Shulchan Aruch</I>, it would be permissible for everyone.</P>
<P>However, this is not quite the case. In his commentary on the above cited statement in the <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> the <I>Biur Halachah</I> notes as follows: <I>katvu hasefarim shezehu neemar liklal haolam shein kulam yecholim lizakot laalot lemadregah ramah zu liheyot oskam rak batorah levadah, aval anashim yechidim yuchal lehimatze bechol et beofen zeh (vezehu sheamru beBerachot 36b harbeh asu keRashbi velo alta beyadan, ratza lomar davka harbeh) veHakadosh Baruch Hu bevadai yamtzi lahem parnasatam, vekeein zeh katav haRambam perek 13 mehilchot shemitin veyovlot velo shevet levi bilvad vechulei, ayein sham, ubifrat im kevar nimtzeu anashim sherotzim lehaspik lo tzarchav kedei sheyaasok betorah bevadai lo shayach zeh, veyisachar vezevulun yochiach.</P>
</I>
<P>It is clear from this statement that if a select few can devote themselves entirely to the study of Torah, they should do so and not engage in any other activity for <I>parnasah</I>. We can therefore say that secular studies, for this purpose, are for <I>almost</I> everyone.</P>
<P>Of course, the big question is who are the few that should devote themselves exclusively to Torah study, as explained in the <I>Biur Halachah</I>, and who are the "klal haolam" who should otherwise work to earn a living? It seems that each individual should decide for himself into which category he best fits.</P>
<P>Rav Chayim of Volozhin writes that an individual who has the capacity to study Torah ll his life, "<I>chovah mutelet alav</I>," to do so (<I>Nefesh HaChayim 1:8)</I>. But what does the word "<I>chovah</I>" mean in this context? Is he, indeed, obligated to do so? This is somewhat problematic because of a very famous question raised by all the <I>meforshim</I>. We have already seen the disagreement in the Gemara between Rashbi who says that a person should study Torah all day and Rav Yishmael who says that a person should work to earn a livelihood. The <I>Tosafot Rav Yehudah Hachasid</I> points out that this contradicts another Gemara where we find the exact opposite positions being taken regarding this same issue of how much Torah a person is obligated to learn to the exclusion of everything else. There is Rashbi who says that a person should study Torah a little in the morning  and a little in the evening while it is Rav Yishmael who says a person should study Torah all the time. Rav Yishmael interprets the verse, <I>"vehagita bo yomam valayla,</I>" (Josh. 1:8) as an obligation to study Torah "all day and all night," while according to Rashbi, one can fulfill this obligation even by the recital of the morning and evening <I>shema</I>. In attempting to show the consistency of Rashbi's opinion, the <I>Tosafot Rav Yehudah Hachasid </I>says, <I>"elah mitzva bealma hu dekeamar mipnei bittul torah." </I>When Rashbi says in Berachot that a person is supposed to study all day and all night, he does not mean that there is an obligation to learn Torah all day. The obligation can technically be fulfilled even by the most minute learning during the day and during the evening. But ideally, for a <I>mitzva bealma</I>, - to do Hashem's will - it should be all day. </P>
<P>then why does Rav Chayim of Volozhin use the expression, "<I>chovah mutelet alav</I>?" One gets the impression that if a person has no financial needs, he is <I>obligated</I> to study Torah all day. Yet, from the <I>Tosafot Rav Yehudah Hachasid </I>it would seem that such intense Torah study is laudable and advisable and even represents the will of Hashem, still, the strict expression of "obligation" or "<I>chiyuv" </I>would not be appropriate. Perhaps Rav Chayim understands that one who has the capacity to study Torah all his life is an exception to the rule. </P>

<P><I>Parshat Balak</I> does not contain any of the <I>taryag mitzvot</I>, <I>nonethless</I>, it is rich, as it provides us with fundamental character development information. "<I>Derech eretz kadmah</I> <I>l'torah</I>,' is clearly demonstrated and personified by Bilaam.</P>
<P>Towards the end of chapter 5 of <I>Avot</I>, this week's <I>perek</I>, the <I>mishna</I> presents the differences between Avraham <I>Avinu</I> and Bilaam. One would have expected that Avraham would be portrayed as the one who observed Torah and <I>mitzvot</I> This was taught to us in <I>Bereishit</I> (26:5) where Hashem expresses His extension of the covenant with Yitzchak as his father, "Listened to My voice, and observed My commandments, statutes and laws." The sages inform us that even Ravnic laws were scrupulously observed by Avraham, even <I>eruv tavshilin</I>. This was a phenomenal accomplishment when we consider the environment and times in which he lived -one immersed in idolatry. Bilaam, on the other hand, lived at a time when the entire world saw the hand of Hashem in <I>Mitzrayim</I>, the splitting of  the <I>Yam</I>, and the revelation at Sinai. Still, he violated many laws of the Torah, including bestiality (<I>Sanhedrin</I> 105b). </P>
<P>The <I>mishna</I> does not focus on their actions, but rather on their nature and character. Avraham became the giant that he was, the father of the nation, because he had good character, and Bilaam, despite all his potential, was killed by the sword (<I>Bamidbar</I> 30:8) because of his terrible character traits. </P>
<P>The <I>mishna</I> in <I>Avot</I> notes that in his commentary , <I>Rabbeinu</I> Yonah, did not have to begin with the introduction that, "whoever possesses the following three traits is among the disciples of Avraham, and whoever has three different traits is among the disciples of the wicked Bilaam" (<I>Mishna</I> 19). It could have begun directly, i.e., "Whoever has a good eye (lack of jealousy), a humble spirit (modesty and humility), and a meek soul (humbling oneself and co-existing with average people) is to be reckoned among Avraham's students. Whoever has an evil eye (jealous of the next one's success and possessions), an arrogant spirit (haughty and proud) and a greedy soul (desire for wealth, and lust) is among the disciples of the wicked Bilaam. </P>
<P>The reason the <I>mishnah</I> explains itself, says Rabbeinu Yonah, is to emphasize and highlight the fact that these three character traits are what ultimately differentiate between these teachers and their students. Avraham becomes the, "Beloved of Hashem," (Isaiah 41:8) because of his good <I>midot</I> - character, and though Bilaam could have been as good as Avraham, he does not because of his corrupt <I>midot</I>. </P>
<P>A person's character ultimately affects his beliefs: The personal greed of the <I>meraglim</I> causes them to speak badly of <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>, the jealousy of Korach that motivated him to rebel against Moshe and Aaron, and similarly, it was Bilaam's greed that led him to attempt to curse <I>Benei Yisrael</I>. Bilaam knew what was right when he proclaimed, "Let me die the death of the righteous," (<I>Bamidbar</I> 23:10) as understood in the Talmud to be referring to the Patriarchs (<I>Avodah Zarah</I> 25a).  He wanted to die like them, reside in the World to Come like them, but lacked the strength of character to live like them.</P>
<P>This theme is portrayed by Rav Elchanan Wasserman zt"l is his <I>Kovetz Maamarim</I>. In his first essay (on <I>emunah</I>) he demonstrates that is is the heart (<I>midot</I>) that rules the mind (intellect) of man. We can therefore appreciate the daily admonition found in the third paragraph of <I>Shema</I>, <I>"V'lo taturu acharei l'vavchem v'acharei eineichem asher atem zonim achareihem"</I> - "And not explore after your heart and after your eyes after which you stray." Should it not have said , "Do not stray after your mind"? Rav Wasserman contends that all intelligent minds understand and accept the existence of a creator, a God. However, the negative forces in man, i.e., his pride, greed, lust, drive for power, laziness, etc, interfere with the conclusions of the mind. </P>
<P>May we learn the lessons of <I>Parshat Balaak</I>, that the three sterling attributes we mentioned are enough to categorize us as a student of Avraham, but one who is lacking these three traits, despite other positive ones, he has not yet been promoted to the class of Avraham <I>Avinu</I>.</P>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Benjamin Yudin]]></author>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: behar]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<I><P>Parshat Bahar</I> begins with the laws of <I>Shemitah</I>- the sabbatical year. There are many significant lessons that the Jew is to acquire from observing these laws which include not working his land, and not doing business with the produce that grows from the land in the seventh year. The Seforno, in his comment on the verse where the Torah states, "The land shall observe a <I>Shabbat</I> rest for <I>Hashem</I>," teaches that the purpose of this year when the farmer is not engaged in agriculture, is not to tRavel or pursue other hobbies and interests, but, "<I>lahashem</I>," it is a year to be devoted to the study of His Torah. Imagine what a positive impact this can have on the life of the farmer, and his family, who now sits in the <I>Beit HaMikdash</I> for a full year and looks to serve <I>Hashem</I> thru acts of <I>chessed</I>. Moreover, the Seforno reminds us that the term, "<I>shabbat lahashem</I>," is found in the <I>Aseret HaDibrot</I> (Shemot 20:10) regarding our weekly observance of <I>Shabbat</I>. Likewise, the parsha's purpose is to attain a closeness to <I>Hashem</I> through Torah study.</P>
<P>&#9;The <I>Chinuch</I>, in his comment on <I>Mitzva</I> 34, presents two lessons to be derived from <I>Shemitah</I>. Firstly, we affirm our belief in <I>Hashem</I> as Creator. We work the land for six years, and rest on the seventh, as we do every week as we work six days and rest on <I>Shabbat</I>. This demonstrates both the belief that God created the world in six days, and that He is always involved in the activities of man. The second lesson to be culled is the development and enhancement of man's character, and specifically his generosity of spirit. Our Ravs note that man comes into this world with his fists clenched, announcing his readiness and preparedness to acquire. It is the nature of man to be concerned about himself. The laws of <I>Shemitah</I> impact greatly on helping the Jew. To refocus and realize that what he possesses is not only for him, but, "The destitute of your people shall eat," (<I>Shemot</I> 23:11). His taking down the, "No Trespassing" sign for the seventh year helps him to develop from selfish to selfless.</P>
<P>&#9;This generosity of spirit is not only good for the rest of society, but the landowner benefits as well. It is interesting to note that in last weeks <I>parshah</I>, <I>Emor</I>, in <I>Parshat HaMoadim</I> (Chap. 23) there are many mitzvot related to the different holidays, but all are <I>mitzvot</I> between man and God- <I>ben adam lechavero</I>. There is one exception. The closing verse of the holiday of <I>Shavuot</I> deals with the landowner leaving a corner of his field for the poor along with the gleanings of his harvest (<I>Vayikra</I> 23:22). Why is this an integral part of the <I>Shavuot</I> section, especially since this law is already taught in <I>Parshat Kedoshim</I>? Perhaps the Torah is hinting at the idea that commensurate with your generosity to others will be your personal acquisition of Torah. Generosity of spirit is a prerequisite for Torah.</P>
<P>&#9;This is further substantiated by the "<I>Sabbah</I>" (Elder) of Kelm who strongly recommended that during the 49 days of <I>Sefirat HaOmer</I> Jews study the 48 methods through which Torah is acquired as taught in the last chapter of <I>Avot</I>, and on <I>erev yom tov</I> to review them all. Note, says the Vilna Gaon <I>zt"l</I>, no one Jew can effectively master all 48 traits. Our character, intellect and temperament differ one from another. Rather, each individual is capable of mastering only several of these traits. Then, the more positive interaction there is between one another, the more we will be able to absorb and imbibe from our neighbors. (This is comparable to the Meshech Chochma's comment on, "<I>naaseh venishma</I>," where he says that no one Jew can fulfill all 613 <I>mitzvot</I>. Only together as a people- the <I>kohanim</I> doing theirs, the king's his, women theirs- may we as a people observe the Torah in its entirety.) If however, one lives by the "good fences make good neighbors" policy, the amount one will receive from others will be limited. Therefore, suggests the Gaon zt"l, not all the 48 methods are of equal value. Rather he sharply interprets the familiar verse, "<I>rabot banot asu chayil veat alit al kuylana</I>," -many daughters --meaning Torah scholars-- do "<I>chayil</I>", whose numerical value is 48 (i.e. methods of Torah acquisition), but "<I>veat</I>"-from aleph to taf there is one virtue that exceeds them all. This virtue is "<I>ohev et habriyot</I>" - loves mankind (#32). The Gra explains that commensurate with one's love of mankind will be the ability to acquire the positive traits of the next person. Thus love and generosity of spirit is most beneficial to one's acquisition of Torah. (It is interesting to note that the students of Rav Akiva stopped dying after the day that corresponded to "<I>ohev et Haberiyot</I>.")</P>
<P>&#9;Finally, today is <I>Pesach Sheini</I>. While there is a <I>machloket</I> in the ninth chapter of <I>Pesachim</I> (93a), Rebbi maintains that the second <I>Pesach</I> is a festival in its own right, and R' Natan holds that it is a make-up and substitute for the first <I>Pesach</I>. In reference to the latter opinion, why does this institution apply only to <I>Pesach</I>, and not to a situation where one missed <I>sukkah</I>, <I>shofar</I> or <I>lulav</I>? Perhaps you can say because of the significance of <I>Pesach</I>  including its punishment of <I>karet</I>. Alternatively, one could say, as the Torah teaches us in <I>Bamidbar</I> (9:6-7) that the persons who came to Moshe unable to participate in the <I>Pesach</I> were excused and exempt. "<I>Ones</I> <I>rachmana</I> <I>patrei</I>." However their cry of, "<I>lama</I> <I>nigra</I>?" - why should we be diminished?- demonstrated a love for <I>mitzvot</I>, a generosity of spirit that said - don't excuse us - find a way to include us. Their generosity of spirit  in performing <I>mitzvot</I> earned for them and for us an additional <I>mitzvah</I> - <I>Pesach</I> <I>Sheini</I>- which teaches us how important is our attitude toward <I>mitzvot</I>.&#9; </P>

<I><P>Parshas Toldos</I> presents a struggle and tension in the realm of ethics and etiquette. In the former, it is interesting to note that the Torah describes how Avraham catered to his guests, "and he ran towards them," (18:2), "<I>vayemaher</I>" (v.6), he hurried, "<I>veel habakar ratz avraham</I>" (v.7), "and Avraham ran to the heard." Similarly, Rivka extended her <I>chessed</I>, "<I>vatemaher vatored kadah</I>" (24:18)-"She hastened and brought down her pitcher,"  "<I>Vatemaher vatear kadah el hashoket</I>"- "She hastened and she poured out her pitcher into the trough."</P>
<P>Yaakov, on the other hand, when commanded by his mother to bring the two goats for her to prepare, understandably in an effort to exact the <I>brachos</I> before Esav returned, the Torah teaches, "<I>Vayelech vayikach vayavei leimo"</I> (27:14), he went and took and brought them to his mother without any haste. Yaakov, the man of truth, found it most difficult to deceive his father. It is only after his mother, Rivka, assured him that she was prophetically informed that he would not suffer for this action that Yaakov acquiesced to her command (charge).</P>
<P>In the realm of etiquette, the Torah teaches that Esav returned from the field feeling faint. He then instructs Yaakov, who had prepared a pottage, to, "pour down my throat some of this red stuff, for I am faint (25:30)." Yaakov, who according to our <I>Chazal</I> (brought down in Rashi) is aware of the serious misdeeds of Esav that had contributed to his feeling faint, realized that his sibling was not worthy of representing his family in spiritual matters and sacrificial service. Yaakov therefore asked Esav to sell him his birthright. Had Esav spurned and shamed the birthright prior to satisfying his hunger, one could perhaps attribute his behavior to his famished predicament. However, the Torah informs us that, "He ate, he drank, he arose, and he went, and Esav shamed the birthright" (25:34). </P>
<P>Our Ravs see Esav's character in the word "<I>vayibez</I>" - he shamed the birthright. The <I>Pirkei D'R' Eliezer </I>(Ch. 28) teaches that Esav spurned and rejected <I>bris milah</I> . Moreover, in <I>Megillas Esther</I>, the verse states, "<I>vayibez bainyan</I>"- it was contemptible to Haman to harm Mordechai alone, so Haman sought to destroy  all the Jews. The <I>medrash</I> (<I>Esther Rabbah</I> 7:10) calls Haman a <I>bazuy ben bazuy</I> - the disgraceful son of the (descendant) of the disgraceful one. The only other place that <I>vayibez</I> is used is with Esav, Haman's ancestor. Just as Esav belittled and disgraced the holy, so did Haman belittle and disgrace Israel, the holy people.</P>
<P>In contrast, our heritage is replete with dignity and respect, even when it comes to eating. (See <I>Derech Eretz Rabbah</I> ch. 6-9.) The  <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> in  <I>Orach Chaim</I> (ch. 170) stresses that one is not to eat in a gluttenous fashion. We are to behave in a dignified manner in order to reflect the <I>tzelem elokim</I>, the sanctity and worth of man who is created "in the image of God." There is no license to "pig-out" , as this is the pattern and behavior of Esav- one who divests himself of sanctity. We thus understand why our sages teach (<I>Kiddushin</I> 40b) that one who eats in the street is compared to a dog, and some say he id disqualified from testifying in court. Rashi explains that since ha lacks self-respect and a sense of shame, two factors that provide a natural barrier to perjury, he can not be relied upon to give honest testimony. </P>
<P>One can appreciate and value their self-worth and dignity if they are ever cognizant of their "<I>tzelem elokim</I>" - their bwing created in the image of God. It is fascinating to note that the soul is called "<I>kavod</I>"- honor. We recite daily the Psalm (30:13), "<I>Lemaan yizamercha kavod velo yidom,</I>" - "So that my soul might sing to you and not be stilled". It is the soul and man's awareness thereof that affords him his dignity. Hillel taught his students the same important lesson, when upon leaving them one <I>erev shabbos</I>, he told them he was about to perform a <I>mitzvah</I>. He piqued their interest, and they inquired as to the specifics. Hillel then told his students that he was about to take a bath. When he noticed their amazement, he added that as guards in a museum wash the busts and statues of the king as a sign of respect, I , who was created in the image of God, must certainly do so (<I>Vayikra Rabbaj</I> 34:3).</P>
<P>(There is a delicate and difficult balance  between acknowledging one's <I>kavod</I> and worth, and haughtiness. If one is aware of their worth, then their actions, prayer, and Torah study affect, not only to themselves, but to the environment.  The <I>Tifferes Shlomo</I> on <I> parshas Noach </I>teaches that Noach did not pray on behalf of his generation as he did not believe that his prayers could have made a difference. How wrong he was.</P>
<P>In addition, the <I>Bach</I> in his commentary on the laws of chanukah writes that the reason the Temple was taken over by the rebels was that the Jewish nation did not show sufficient respect for the <I>Beis HaMikdash.</I> When they did demonstrate their willingness to fight for, and lay down their lives for it, it reverted to being in their hands. When we honor <I>Hashem</I>, man, <I>mitzvos</I>, and Torah, we are honored in return.)</P>
<P>R. Yochanan used to refer to his clothes as "those that honor me." The Talmud (<I>Shabbos</I> 113a) explains the verse in Isaiah (58:13), "<I>vechibadeto measot derachecha"</I> -"and you shall honor it (the shabbos) by not doing your ways". Your <I>shabbos</I> garments should not be the same as your weekday clothes. Moreover, regarding King David, the Talmud (<I>Berachos 62b</I>) teaches that as he "cut off the corner of Saul's cloak" (Samuel I 24:5), "whoever dishonors clothing will in the end not have use of them." Though David's motivation was sincere- he had wanted to show his father-in-law, who wanted to  kill him- that when David had the opportunity to inflict harm on Saul, David refrained.  Nonetheless, his cutting the corner of Saul's garment resulted in his garments, in later years, being insufficiently warm, as we are taught (Kings I 1:1), "They covered him with garments, but they did not warm him." The Talmud reinforces the principle that only if one gives respect does he receive it in return.</P>
<P>It is interseting to not that the <I>Mishna</I> (<I>Avos</I> 3:15) teaches that if one humiliates another individual in public, you lose your share in the world to come. Yet, if one actually murders somebody, the murderer is subject to capital punishment, but does not lose his share in the world to come. Humiliating another individual deprives him of his <I>kavod</I> - dignity. The <I>Navi </I>Isaiah (43:7) teaches that, "Everyone who is called by My name, and who I have created for My glory", i.e., mans' purpose is to increase the honor of <I>Hashem</I> in this world. By honoring another individual, we acknowledge their worth. Thus teaches Ben Zoma (<I>Avos</I> 4:1) who is honored? He who honors others."</P>
<P>Esav is the epitome of "<I>bizuy</I>"- disregard. The <I>Navi</I> Obadiah refers to him as, "you are very despised". Yaakov is the personification of reverence and respect. He wrests the birthright from his brother, and as <I>Rashi</I> explains (<I>Bereishis 25:31) </I> Yaakov felt that an evildoer such as Esav was not worthy of the sacrificial service. It was not for his own <I>kavod</I> that he purchsed the birthright, but for the honor of <I>Hashem</I>. Yaakov understands the worth and significance of the <I>avodah</I>. </P>
<I><P>Parshas Toldos</I> provides us with a great deal more than atale of sibling rivalry. It prompts us to ask ourselves- do our <I>mitzvos </I>and <I> tefillos</I> reflect the proper <I>kavod shamayim</I> - honor to <I>Hashem</I> or our own? Often, our prayers are not answered because they only reflect our personal and communal needs. All prayers must include the underlying theme that we want our lives to increase <I>kavod shomayim</I>. We are trying to attain in this world what we are told of <I>Hashem</I>'s world: "In His temple all proclaim glory" (Psalms 29:9). </P>

<P>The Rambam in <I>Parshat Vayakhel </I>(35:21) makes an interesting observation. He notes that none of <I>Benei Yisrael</I>  were trained in the various crafts, or skills necessary to build a <I>mishkan</I>. Moreover, in his commentary on <I>Parshat Ki Tissa</I> (31:2) he notes that the difficult physical labor in Egypt hardly prepared them for the delicate detailed craftsmanship involved in building the <I>mishkan</I>. What enables the former slaves to succeed was their "<I>nediv lev</I>" , their motivated spirit, and their absolute determination to implement God's command. the "<I>nesias lev</I>" , the inspired heart, was the necessary prerequisite for the job. Once man takes the initiative in the realm of spirituality, Hashem completes and implements the mission. </P>
<P>On the <I>pasuk</I>, "Moshe counted their [the Levites] according to the word of Hashem," (<I>Bamidbar</I> 3:16) Rashi teaches that Moshe was troubled as to how he would succeed in counting  the <I>Leviim</I> from the age of 30 days. Could he possibly enter each tent and count the number of suckling infants? Thereupon Hashem said to him, "You do yours and I will do mine." Moshe stood outside the entrance of each tent and a <I>bat-kol</I>, a heavenly voice, proclaimed the number of male children in each tent. One could ask: if the census was coming from the <I>bat-kol</I>, why did Moshe have to go from tent to tent? The answer is: he had to do his part and only then did Hashem finish.</P>
<P>The Chafetz Chaim zt"l in his commentary on the beginning of <I>ParshatTerumah </I>(25:8) quotes that Moshe was troubled as to how <I>Benei Yisrael</I> could make a dwelling place for the <I>Shechina </I>- Divine presence-? How, in keeping  with  <I>Parshat Shekalim</I>,  they could offer a redemption for their souls? Hashem responds in  essence -you do yours- open for Me as little as the eye of a needle and I will respond with a great response, providing that your initiative is an expression of your maximum potential.</P>
<P>Rav Yerucham Levoitz  zt"l , <I>Mashgiach</I> of the Mirrer Yeshiva, cites the following medrash (<I>Devarim Rabbah 5:2)</I> to inspire man to great initiatives: The wise King Solomon (<I>Mishle 6:6)</I> teaches, "Go to the ant, you lazy individual, note his ways and become wise."What are we to learn from the behavior of an ant? The Ravs note that the life span  of the ant is but 6 months. The amount of food that the ant needs for its entire  lifetime is 1.5 grains of wheat. Yet, the an \t spends its life accumulating 300 kur., excessively more than it needs. It reasons that perhaps Hashem will grant me longevity, and I will have the food readily available. Note the drive and initiative of the ant ; this is what man is to learn to emulate.</P>
<P>Rav Kook zt"l explained the verse in <I>Mishle</I> (29:4) "Through justice a king establishes a land, but - <I>veish trumos</I>- a man of graft tears it down." The <I>ish trumos</I> he explained to be the one who follows the minimal law regarding <I>terumah</I> (the gift that the Jewish landowner is obligated to give to the <I>kohen</I>) "<I>chitah achat poteret et ha-kri", </I> one grain given to the <I>kohen</I> is sufficient to satisfy the biblical obligation. However, this minimalistic approach to one's endeavors and especially their spirituality will lead to ultimate failure and dissatisfaction.</P>
<P>Too often people make a great error: They think it's God's responsibility to inspire man. The trouble is that He does, as David teaches in Psalm 19, "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the expanse of the sky tells of his handiwork." But even if one does not clearly perceive Hashem in nature it is mans' calling to take that first step. Then Hashem will carry him over the large, seemingly impassable abyss.</P>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Yakov Haber]]></author>

		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: succos]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The <I>Haftorot</I> for both the first day of <I>Sukkot</I> (from <I>Zecharia</I> 14) and <I>Shabbos Sheb'toch Ha'moed</I> (from <I>Yechezkel</I> 38-39) describe the wars of Gog and Magog, the battles preceding the advent of the Messianic Era.  These battles revolve around Jerusalem with the chief combatants being Edom and Yishmael (see Malbim to <I>Yechezkel</I> 38:2).  Certainly the recent tragic events, once again pitting Christian (the traditional inheritors of the Edom dynasty) countries against Moslem (descendants of Yishmael) countries, are frightening reminders of the eventual fulfillment of these prophecies.</P>
<P>Zecharia prophesies that after the battle, all the nations of the world will be called upon to celebrate the festival of <I>Sukkot</I> with dire consequences for those refusing to do so.  Presumably building on this concept, the Talmud in Masechet Avoda Zara (2a-3b) relates that in the future, Hashem will prepare the reward for those who were faithful to the Torah and its precepts throughout history.  The nations of the world will advance various claims as to why they should receive reward even though they rejected the Torah and did not fulfill its commandments.  Finally, Hashem grants them a last opportunity  for merit by commanding them to build <I>sukkot</I> and dwell in them.  After the nations build their <I>sukkot</I>, Hashem  shines the sun in full force making the heat intolerable, after which the frustrated nations leave the <I>sukka</I> and kick the <I>sukka</I> during their hasty exit. G-d then laughs at the nations' insincerity.  The Talmud questions why this should be held against the nations since, after all, even Jews are exempt from this <I>mitzva  </I>when it is uncomfortable (<I>mitz'ta'eir</I>) to remain in the <I>sukka.  </I>The answer given is that at least the Jews do not kick the <I>sukka</I> when leaving.</P>
<P>Perhaps we can offer a deeper explanation as to why the <I>mitzva </I>of <I>sukka</I> is singled out as the test for the nations of the world and why their refusal to fulfill it leads to such great punishment. Divine Commandments, the <I>Mitzvot</I>, can be fulfilled in one of two ways: 1) as necessary burdens, albeit beneficial, lofty ones; 2) as welcome opportunities to serve the Master of the World.  The former is symptomatic of only a King-Servant relationship with Hashem; the latter adds to this the loving Father-Son relationship.  Indeed, G-d is referred to as "Avinu Malkeinu" -- "Our Father; Our King."  On the one hand, we have no choice but to fulfill the <I>d'var Hashem -- </I>the word of G-d -- as transgression will lead to severe punishment and fulfillment to immense reward.  But on the other hand, we rejoice at the opportunity to please our Heavenly Father.   (See Mishna Avot 1:3 and commentaries there.)  How a person reacts when faced with difficulties while performing <I>mitzvot</I>,<I> </I><B> </B>even those hardships exempting him from their fulfillment, demonstrates his underlying attitude<B> </B>toward the commandments. One who views <I>mitzvot </I>as burdens is pleased with the exemption and even resents the hardship leading to the exemption, it being indicative of an increased burden associated with the commandment. By contrast, the <I>oheiv  </I>is saddened by the missed opportunity to please his Creator.  Hence, the <I>Umot HaOlam </I>kick the <I>sukka </I> while leaving it due to uncomfortableness, indicative of a purely pragmatic approach to commandments; the Jews leave as well, but reluctantly (see Ramo (639:7)), demonstrating their love of G-d and His commandments..</P>
<P>These are the contrasting attitudes between <I>K'lal Yisrael </I>and the <I>Umot HaOlam </I>(Nations of the World).  <I>K'lal Yisrael </I>jubilantly declared <I>"Na'ase V'Nishma" </I>to accept the Torah at Har Sinai. The other nations, after discovering that its precepts would be difficult to keep, rejected it.  <I>K'lal Yisrael </I>yearns for more opportunities for <I>mitzvot; </I> the <I>Umot HaOlam </I>rejoice when the burden is lifted.  Specifically the <I>mitzva </I>of <I>sukka </I> readily emphasizes this point.  <I>Sukka </I>is one of the few <I>mitzvot</I> that encompass the entire body and all life activities.  Eating and sleeping as well as learning and prayer all are complementary aspects of this <I>mitzva.  </I>Indeed, the <I>poskim </I>(decisors) rule that even regular conversation with acquaintances should take place in the <I>sukka.</I>  Thus, all apparently mundane activities can become acts of Divine Service. One who views <I>mitzvot </I>as all-pervasive opportunities for elevating every aspect of life would also perform them with love and enthusiasm. The nations reject this <I>sukka-</I>concept of life revolving around the Divine Command.  Hence, they reject the entire message of Torah and are not worthy of special Divine Reward in the End of Days.</P>
<P>Indeed, unique <I>korbanot </I>are brought during the first seven days of <I>Sukkot</I> on behalf of the 70 nations of the world as our Torah concerns itself with the benefit of all of mankind and looks toward the day when all the nations of the world will recognize G-d's oneness (see second half of <I>'Aleinu </I>prayer). However, the inner meaning of <I>Sukkot</I> ultimately remains the special treasure of the Jewish people. Hence, on the last day of the holiday, <I>Sh'mini Atzeret</I>, <I>korbanot </I>are offered on behalf of only <I>K'lal Yisrael</I> as Hashem, requesting that His beloved children who serve Him with love stay another day, states: <I>"kashe alay preidaschem" -- </I>"your leaving is difficult for Me."</P>
<P>This aspect of <I>'ahava</I> in the performance of <I>mitzvot</I> is further highlighted by the intense, extra joy accompanying the celebration of <I>Sukkot </I>(see Rav Rosensweig, <a href="rros_sukkos.html">The Link Between Yom Kippur and Sukkot</a>).  In addition, the <I>mitzva </I>of <I>Nisuch Hamayim </I>(water pouring) on the <I>mizbai'ach </I>has been explained as an allusion to the verse in <I>Shir HaShirim (8:7): "mayim rabim lo yuch'lu l'chabot et ha'ahavah"  -- </I>"a multitude of water cannot extinguish the love (between <I>K'lal Yisrael </I>and their G-d)."</P>
<P>May the merit of our increased enthusiastic devotion to Hashem's commandments out of love allow us to be spared from the great wars of Gog and Magog and merit to dwell in the heavenly S<I>ukkas 'Oro Shel Leviathan</I>!</P>

		<title><![CDATA[<I>Shekalim</I> - The Art of Counting]]></title>

		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: shekalim]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>Apparently
concerned that we would not properly observe the mitzvah of the
national census, <I>Hashem</I> did not simply describe the half
shekel by which every Jew would be counted.  Rather, as <I>Rashi</I>
points out, <I>Hashem</I> actually showed Moshe the very coin as He
said, "<I>Zeh Yitnu</I> -This is the [half shekel that every
Jew] shall contribute"(<I>Ki Sisa</I>, 30:13).  That coin, Rav
<I>Meir</I> tells us, was made of fire and was brought forth from no
less sacred a place than from under the <I>Kisei Hakavod</I> - the
throne of the A-mighty. (<I>Rashi</I>, ad loc.)    Why did <I>Hashem</I>
express such anxiety about this mitzvah? Surely Moshe could picture a
half shekel on his own with due description.  After all it is unlike
the menorah that understandably needed virtual visible support to
help Moshe guide those who will hammer out the menorah's flowers,
bulbs and cups, angles and curves. In this matter it would seem that
each Jew would respond to Moshe's call with the appropriate half
shekel even if Moshe had never seen the shekel of fire.</p>

<P>
Perhaps
the "coin of fire" vision came to impress upon Moshe and
future leaders that every census of any sort is fraught with danger. 
Indeed counting any people and certainly the "<I>mamleches 
kohanim</I>"  was nothing less than playing with  fire.  We all
know fire to be the most destructive of natural forces when it is not
contained and allowed to consume indiscriminately all that it meets. 
We are also equally aware of the creative and purifying powers of
controlled fires, that provide energy, heat and a host of modern
materials. Similarly counting people into aggregates can easily
communicate a disinterest in one's individual strengths and the
personal passion that may accompany them.  Being impressed with
numbers may train us to overlook that which defies quantification,
the "<I>chelek eloka mima'al</I>" - that <I>Hashem</I>
invested in each and every one of us.   How many times were we
reminded just last year to participate in the American national
census in order to make sure that our needs would be recognized?
These reminders implicitly assured us that a small unique group, no
matter how much they would have to offer, would carry little weight. 
 On the other hand, letting one know that the community counts on
their contribution - be it the financial contribution of only a half
shekel, a brief  visit to someone in need, or a probing question in a
<I>shiur</I>- shapes lives that are confident in their ability to
affect the common good.  Moreover it will forge a community that
capitalizes on the strength of all its members.  In this regard, I
often think of the feeling that a bar mitzvah age boy must feel when
he is the tenth man in a <I>minyan</I>, and certainly in a town to
whom that does not come easy. The child quickly learns the that 
simply being in the right place can make a difference and will
hopefully build on that in the future.  So it was with the half
shekel count that would bring every Jew to a private moment with
<I>Moshe Rabeinu </I>and <I>Aharon Hakohen,</I> making sure that this
count will raise the self-image of every Jew.</p>

<P>
The
power of this kind of census is taught to us through the phrase "<I>Ki
sisa</I>" which translates "when you count" but
literally means "when you raise up".  That is why the
<I>medrash</I> portrays  <I>Hashem</I> directing Moshe to study this
parsha in order to find in it the eternal protection of our
distinctiveness.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[<I>Parshat ha-Chodesh</I> and its link with <I>Pesach</I>]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Michael Rosensweig]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2001]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: hachodesh]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[


<P><I>Parshat ha-Chodesh</I>, the last of four special
Torah readings before <I>Pesach</I> develops the theme of <I>kidush
ha-hodesh</I>. <I>Chazal</I> frequently attest to the unique status
and stature of this <I>mitzvah</I>. Indeed, as Rashi (Bereshit 1:1)
citing the midrash notes, it would have been appropriate for the
Torah itself to have begun with <I>kidush ha-chodesh</I> if not for
the pressing need to establish K<I>elal Yisrael's</I> legal claim to
<I>Eretz Yisrael</I> by means of the creation account. <I>Kidush
ha-Chodesh</I>, in fact, represents the first <I>mitzvah</I>
addressed to the collective community of <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>. The
spiritual dimension of <I>kidush ha-Chodesh</I> is alluded to when
the midrash declares: "<I>kol ha-mekadesh ha-chodesh be-zemano
ke-ilu me-kabel penai ha-Shechinah</I>". While the basic
connection between this reading and <I>Pesach</I> is evident, as
Nissan is the first of the months, it is possible that the unique
character of this mitzvah also contributes to and enhances our
commemoration and celebration of <I>Pesach</I>.
</P>

<P><I>Kidush ha-Chodesh</I> marks an important
transition in the relationship between Hashem and the Jewish nation.
It exemplifies a significant expansion of the covenant. By entrusting
the nation with the designation and determination of time by means of
<I>kidush ha-chodesh</I>, Hashem, in effect, demanded of <I>Klal
Yisrael</I> a more active and responsible role in their own destiny.
The midrash (Shemot Rabah 15:3) expresses this clearly, recording a
conversation between Hashem and his heavenly retinue in which the
angels are informed that <I>Klal Yisrael</I> will henceforth dictate
the <I>moadim</I>: "<I>amar la-hem ani ve-attem naskim al mah
she-yisrael gomrin...im amartem hen hen; im amartem lav lav</I>".
Through the institution of <I>kidush ha-chodesh</I>, Hashem bestowed
no less than a measure of autonomy, independence and initiative to
<I>Klal Yisrael</I>. It is no coincidence that <I>yeziat Mitzrayim,</I>
in which a loosely federated people was transformed into a unified
nation with a collective destiny, is tied to <I>kidush ha-chodesh</I>.
</P>
<P>The motif of autonomy and initiative reflected in
<I>kidush ha-chodesh</I> is reflected in two realms that are critical
to Jewish existence. Rav Soloveitchik zt"l (Gesher vol. I) has
developed the theme that time-awareness is crucial to freedom and
liberation. The slave is prototypical of non-time-conscious man since
his time is not his own. He is excluded from time-bound <I>mitzvot</I>
(<I>mitzvot aseh she-hazeman gerama</I>) because he has no
sensitivity to time. By authorizing the Jewish people to designate
the new month, Hashem endowed them with dignity and liberty that
accompanies time-consciousness. The link to <I>chag ha-cherut</I> is
self-evident.
</P>
<P>This license also reflects <I>Klal Yisrael's</I>
initiative in the <I>halachic</I> realm. The midrash connects the
authority to sanctify the new moon with the legacy of Torah itself :
"<I>Maggid devaRav le-Yaakov- zu Torah; chukav u-mishpatav
le-yisrael- zu kidush ha-chodesh she-yesh ba-hem chukim u-mishpatim.</I>"
On a practical level, <I>kidush ha-chodesh </I>obviously has great
impact, as it determines the date of <I>moadim</I>, affecting all
related <I>halachot</I>. More significantly, <I>kidush ha-chodesh</I>
emerges as a powerful symbol of halachic initiative and
responsibility. "<I>Lachem- bein shogegin, bein mutaiin, bein
anusin, harei zeh mekudash</I>". This theme projects the
independence and self-sufficiency of the <I>halachic</I> process
reflected by such principles as "<I>lo ba-shamayim hi</I>"(B.
M. 59b) and "<I>ein navi rashai le-chadesh davar me-atah</I>"
(Megillah 3a).
</P>
<P>This concept, however, should not be misconstrued.
<I>Halachic</I> initiative and independence exists only within
defined parameters and the specific framework established by the
<I>halachic</I> system itself. <I>Kidush ha-Chodesh</I> itself is by
no means arbitrary or indiscriminate. It follows strict procedures
that include testimony, investigation, calculations, formal judicial
pronouncements etc. Any deviation from normative protocols may render
the sanctification invalid. Moreover, the range of acceptable options
is limited in <I>kidush ha-chodesh</I>, as it is in other domains of
<I>halacha</I>. With respect to the calendar specifically, only the
30th or 31st day may qualify as <I>Rosh Chodesh</I>. As is true for
<I>halacha</I> generally, ultimate authority for <I>kidush ha-chodesh</I>
is granted and entrusted to those select scholars who are attuned and
sensitive to <I>halachic</I> nuances (See, for example, Rambam, hil.
<I>kidush ha-chodesh</I> 1:5; Sefer ha-Mitzvot, <I>esin</I>, no. 153,
and Ramban ad. loc).
</P>
<P>The institution of <I>kidush ha-chodesh</I> recorded
in <I>Parshat ha-Chodesh</I> is more than just an introduction to the
commemoration of <I>yetziat Mitzrayim</I>. By underscoring <I>Klal
Yisrael's</I> calendar role, the Torah demonstrates the transition
from slavery to authentic liberation that includes
time-consciousness. As a paradigm for independent, responsible
<I>halachic</I> initiative, <I>kidush ha-chodesh</I> further projects
the well- known Ravnic theme that true liberation consists of a
total commitment to the study of Torah and <I>halachic</I>
observance. <I>Klal Yisrael's</I> expanded role, its assumption of
greater initiative and independence in the pursuit of greater
submission to the Divine Will ultimately paved to road to <I>mattan
Torah</I>.

<P>According to the popular opinion in the Midrash, five of the <I>aseres hadibros</I> (ten commandment) were etched out on one stone, and the other five on the other stone (as is commonly displayed in shuls). The midrash adds that the first of the <I>dibros</I> ("<I>onochi hashem</I>..." -  "I am the Lord....") is related to the sixth ("<I>lo sirtzoch</I>"), which was parallel to it; the second is related to the seventh, which was parallel to it, etc. </P>
<P>Our religion believes in a kind God, who has created man in His image, <I>betzelem Elokim</I>. Because of this <I>tzelem Elokim</I> which was imparted to all people, our religion preaches the importance of <I>kavod hebriyos</I>. One who kills another human being, or even as much as acts in a disrespectful fashion towards others, obviously does not appreciate the other person's <I>tzelem Elokim</I>. This lack of appreciation of the concept of <I>tzelem Elokim</I> is often due to a lack of belief in <I>Elokim</I>, or a distorted perception thereof. Years and years of developments of civilization can be overturned and destroyed by people who do not understand <I>Elokim</I>, and consequently do not appreciate the concept of <I>tzelem Elokim</I>.</P>
<P>One of the major themes of Rosh Hashana which comes through the <I>aseres yemei teshuva</I> until Yom Kippur is the idea of <I>malchiyos</I>. God calls upon us to coronate Him; to try to get others to do the same; and God has promised us that the day will come when all of mankind will accept Him as King. According to the interpretation of Rashi, this promise appears in the opening passage of <I>shema yisroel</I>: Hashem, who at present is only recognized as God by us ("<I>Hashem Elokei<U>nu</I></U>) will ultimately be universally accepted as King ("<I>Hashem Echod</I>").</P>
<P>And this is the central theme of the <I>beracha</I> of malchiyos: we pray to Hashem that "<I>meloch al kol ha'olam kulo b'chvodecha</I>", that He should see to it that His promise be fulfilled - that ultimately the day will come that His kingdom will be recognized by all people. And we further plead with God that it is not fair that just because a small group of people reject His Kingship, that the overwhelming majority of the people of the world should suffer. We pray on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur "<I>v'chol ha'rish'a kula k'ashan tichle</I>" that Hashem eradicate that small group who refuse to accept His kingship, and are thereby holding back the fulfillment of the promise of the idea of <I>malchiyos</I>.</P>
<P>On the night of <I>Pesach</I> we celebrate the redemption of <I>Klal Yisroel</I>. At the occasion of y<I>etsias Mitzraim</I>, God promised Moshe Rabbeinu ("<I>eheye asher eheye</I>") that just as He was redeeming <I>Bnei Yisroel</I>, so too the day will come that he will redeem all of mankind. This is the biblical promise of malchiyos. It is for this reason that on <I>Pesach</I> night we recite "<I>nishmas kol chay tivarech es shimcha Hashem Elokeinu</I>"; we pray to God that he see to it that all of mankind should accept His kingship. And on <I>Pesach</I> night as well we pray regarding the small group of people who simply refused to accept - don't allow them to hold up the fulfillment of your promise of malchiyos: "<I>shvoch chamoscha el hagoyim asher lo yedaucha</I>" - pour out your anger on that small group! "<I>Tirdof b'af v'tashmideim mitachas shemei Hashem</I>" ("chase with fury and destroy them from under God's sky").</P>
<P>God has declared that He personally will forever wage battle with Amalek; and He called upon us to participate in that battle. We should not assume that evil will disappear by itself. We must help fight against it. As long as Amalek is still around who are "<I>lo yareh Elokim</I>" (" do not fear God"), the kingship of Hashem is incomplete ("<I>ki yad al keis kah - ain hakisei shaleim....</I>" - "for there is a hand on God's throne - the throne of God is not complete.....").</P>
<P>We still have backward barbarians around who refuse to recognize <I>malchus Hashem</I> (God's kingship). Their distorted perception of <I>Elokus</I> (godliness) causes them not to appreciate the dignity of human life, which rests on the <I>tzelem Elokim</I> of each and every human.</P>
<P>When we blow the shofar at the conclusion of the <I>beracha</I> (blessing) of <I>malchiyos</I>, we are a) coronating God, and accepting Him once again as King; and b) enhancing the urgency of our request at the end of the <I>beracha</I> (blessing) of <I>malchiyos</I> to see to it that His promise of <I>malchiyos</I> be fulfilled.</P>

<P>The Ravs of the Talmud have recorded (<I>Shabbos</I> 88a) the tradition that although the Jewish people accepted the Torah at Mt. Sinai out of their own free will, there was,  nevertheless, an aspect of coercion involved. After the miracle of Purim, the people accepted the Torah again, this time without any element of coercion. Today when we observe Purim, one of the themes being celebrated is this second accepting of the Torah. According to the Geonim, this is the reason that Purim alone was singled out from all the other holidays instituted by the Ravs (and recorded in the <I>Megillas Taanis</I>) to have a <I>mitzva</I> of <I>seuda</I> (eating a festive meal). Just like on <I>Shavuos</I> the Talmud tells us (<I>Pesachim</I> 68b) that all agree that one must have an elaborate meal as part of the commemoration of our accepting the Torah, so to Purim must be celebrated with an elaborate meal for this same reason.</P>
<P>According to the Medrash, the element of coercion at the time of <I>maaamad Har Sinai</I> that necessitated the later second acceptance was regarding the <I>Torah She'beal Peh</I>. The Jews were fully prepared to accept Gods written Torah, since it was clearly of divine origin. But the bulk of the Oral Law consists of laws classified as "<I>divrei sofrim</I>", laws developed by the Ravs over the generations, which have the status of <I>dinim doraisa</I>. The discretion and the judgement of the Ravs is assumed to have been divinely inspired, and therefore has been endowed with <I>doraisa</I> status. The verse in Tehilim (25,14) that G-d reveals his secrets to those who fear him is quoted several times in the Talmud to bring out this point. </P>
<P>This is in no way a contradiction to the principal developed by the Ravs that "<I>lo bashamayim hi</I>" (see <I>Bava Metzia</I> 59b) - that after <I>mattan torah</I> God will no longer reveal any <I>halachos</I> to man in a supernatural fashion, i.e. through prophecy, and any <I>bas kol </I>proclaiming a <I>halachah</I> must be disregarded. Of course God expects <U>us</U> to work out the <I>halacha</I>. At the same time, He has promised to assist the Ravs - from behind the scenes - in their deliberations to see to it that they do not err. The binding force of any <I>psak</I> of any Rav is based on the assumption that the individual <I>posek</I> was granted this supernatural divine assistance.</P>
<I><P>Bnei Yisroel</I> at the time of <I>mattan Torah</I> apparently found it hard to accept this concept (see <I>Meerot</I> <I>Neryah</I> p. 16a). At the time of the <I>nes Purim</I> a group of Ravs known as the A<I>nshei Knesses Hagedolah</I> was setting all the forms of religious observance as they are still being observed today, two thousand years later (<I>brachos, tefilos,</I> categories of <I>halacha</I>). The Jews realized that the <I>yad Hashem</I> was involved in the story from behind the scenes. They came to understand well the concept of "<I>sod Hashem leyereiov.</I>" It becomes understandable that <I>halchos</I> are developed by the Ravs with the <I>yad Hashem</I> guiding them. This is what the <I>Torah Shebaal Peh</I> was always about.</P>
<P>Now that the Jewish people had accepted that part of the Torah again without any coercion, this segment of <I>halachos</I> was able to flourish and to develop in a much greater fashion than ever before. Indeed, the greatest part of the development of the <I>Torah Shebaal Peh</I> took place, historically, after the days of Purim (see <I>Be'Ikvei Hatzon</I> p.138, 114). </P>
<P>The Shalah, in his essay on Purim, points to the <I>posuk</I> in the <I>megillah</I> (8:14) "<I>vehados nitnah beshushan habirah</I>", as an allusion to the concept that the Torah was being reaccepted. The traditional festive Purim meal is eaten to celebrate this reacceptance and should be eaten with such an attitude. Becoming drunk and rowdy simply does not fit in with the correct attitude which should pervade the Purim observance. Purim is not the Jewish Halloween. The custom of putting on masks, and dressing up to conceal one's true identity was never intended to represent a Jewish Mardi-Gras; but rather to show that just as in the story of Purim, one had to look below the surface to see the hidden Mover behind the events, so too in Torah study, one must always look below the surface, and read in-between the lines to gain the insights of the <I>Torah Shebaal Peh, </I>which will actually place everything in the Torah in the proper perspective. The custom of masquerading is to teach us, "<I>al tistakel bekankan elah bemah sheyesh bo!</I>", (Never look at the outer appearance of the container. Always try to investigate what might possibly be hiding beneath the surface.) The fact that God's name never appears in the <I>megillah</I> is also assumed to be for the same reason. The hidden <I>Torah Shebaal Peh </I> interpretation always enlightens the Torah <I>shebiksa,</I> and always puts things into clearer perspective.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[After <I>Krias Yam Suf</I> - Where Do We Go From Here?]]></title>

<P>Immediately
following <I>krias yam suf</I> (the splitting of the Red Sea) the
Jewish people became frustrated because they lacked water in the
desert. The water they did find was bitter and not drinkable until
G-d instructed Moshe to throw wood in the water to sweeten it. <I>Chazal</I>
interpret this lack of water in a spiritual sense as well as a
physical sense. The Torah tells us that the Jewish people tRaveled
three days without water after leaving <I>Yam Suf</I> (the Red Sea).
<I>Chazal</I> understand this to mean that the Jews went three days
without Torah &#150; the spiritual "water" &#150; and this
caused them to complain against G-d. To prevent three days from
passing without Torah, <I>Chazal</I> instituted <I>krias HaTorah</I>
on Monday, Thursday, and <I>Shabbos</I>. 
</P>
<P>This symbolic
understanding of the story seems dificult. The Jewish people are
criticized for tRaveling three days without Torah, however at this
time they had not yet received the Torah! Furthermore, it is
difficult to understand the meaning of the aforementioned "bitter
water" if we interpret this story in a symbolic sense.</P>

<P>The
Kli Yakar offers an insight into the symbolic meaning of the events
surrounding the bitter water. The Jewish people, having experienced 
<I>krias Yam Suf</I>, just
witnessed the climax of <I>Yetsias Mitzraim, </I>whose
ultimate purpose, as they knew, was to
receive the Torah at Mount Sinai. The correct response
to <I>Krias Yam Suf</I> was an eager
desire to get to Mount Sinai. Yet,we find the exact opposite
occurred. <I>Chazal</I> tell
us that Moshe had to drag the Jewish people away from the riches of
the Egyptians that floated to the shore of the <I>Yam Suf</I>.
Even when they finally began their journey away from <I>Yam
Suf</I>, they tRaveled slowly
without anticipation. They were criticized for going three days
without Torah because they should have begged G-d to give them the
Torah immediately. They couldn't be punished for not learning Torah
yet since they had not yet received it,but they could be rebuked for
not asking to receive it sooner.</P>

<P>What caused this
delay in the receiving of the Torah? The <I>Kli Yakar</I> explains
that the fear of something new overcame the Jewish people. All
beginnings are hard, and this trepidation to begin something new
prevented them from running to Mount Sinai. They viewed the Torah as
something difficult which would be bitter, and therefore delyaed
their trip to Mount Sinai.</P>

<P>Moshe was
instructed to show them that although the Torah may appear difficult
at first, perhaps even bitter, it will turn sweet as soon as one
accepts it.</P>

<P>This
lesson of the events following <I>Krias Yam Suf</I>
speaks to each of us. As Pesach somes to and end and each of us has
experienced <I>Yetsias Mitsraim</I>
and <I>Krias Yam Suf</I>
another year, hiw do we approach the <I>Yom Tov</I>
of <I>Shavuos</I>? Do we
delay in our commitment to life of Torah and <I>Mitzvot</I>
because we are afraid it will be too hard, or do we get ready to
approach <I>Shavuous</I> and
<I>Kabbolas HaTorah </I>with
enthusiasm? This is the challenge for each of us as <I>Pesach</I> draws to a close.

		<title><![CDATA[Chanukah: A Time of Renewal]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Mayer Twersky]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2001]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: chanukah]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The <I>parshios </I>of <I>Vayeshev</I> and <I>Miketz</I>, wherein Yosef <I>HaTzadik</I> looms as the central figure, provide the <I>kerias hatorah</I> backdrop for the <I>yom tov</I> of Chanukah. We must separately analyze the <I>yom tov</I> of Chanukah and the religious persona of Yosef <I>HaTzadik</I> in order to appreciate the significance of this calendrical synthesis. What follows is but a brief, incomplete attempt at these analyses. Nonetheless, it is hoped that an appreciation of the aforementioned synthesis will be forthcoming. </P>
<P>The <I>yom tov </I>of Chanukah always encompasses <I>rosh chodesh.</I> This is not simply a calendrical coincidence or inevitability. The timing of the miracle of Chanukah<I> </I>was divinely ordained, and accordingly the timing of the <I>yom tov</I> of Chanukah was indirectly divinely dictated. Rather, the calendrical coincidence reflects a conceptual nexus. <I>Rosh Chodesh</I> marks the renewal of the lunar cycle, and as such is a <I>mo'ed</I> of renewal (<I>hischadshus</I>). Similarly, Chanukah commemorates the rededication of the <I>Beis HaMikdash</I> and as such it too is a <I>yom tov</I> of renewal.</P>
<P>In truth, <I>hischadshus</I> is a daily, miraculous occurrence. <I>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</I> is "<I>mechadesh b'tuvo bechol yom tamid maaseh bereishis"</I>; "He, in His goodness, every day continuously renews the work of creation". Each of us individually is considered a <I>beriah chadashah</I> each day. This ontological renewal, according to Rash"ba, forms the basis of our obligation to wash <I>netilas yadayim</I> and recite <I>Birchos HaShachar</I> each day upon awakening. Nonetheless, while each day is <U>informed</U><I> </I>by <I>hischadshus</I>, the <I>yom tov</I> of Chanukah is <U>dedicated</U> to renewal. Chnukah is a <I>yom tov </I> of <I>hischadshus</I>, and as such the days of Chanukah are especially conducive to cultivating our capacity for self-renewal. This is the <I>avodah</I> of Chanukah.</P>
<P>[Chanukah, with respect to its <I>avodah</I> resembles other <I>yomim tovim</I>. For instance, Pesach is a <I>yom tov</I> of <I>emunah</I>. Obviously, this depiction of Pesach does not suggest that the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>emunah</I> is restricted to Pesach. Rather, it indicates that this permanent component of <I>avodas Hashem</I> is stressed even more than usual on Pesach and accordingly, this <I>yom tov</I> is especially conducive to cultivating and deepening our <I>emunah</I>. The same holds true for the <I>yom tov</I> of Chanukah vis-&agRave;-vis the quality of <I>hischadshus.</I>]</P>
<P>How does our capacity for <I>hischadshus</I> manifest itself? First of all, exercising our capacity for <I>hischadshus</I> allows us to live, happily and successfully, in the present. Let us clarify this point. Without the capacity for <I>hischadshus</I>, the burdensome past, abounding with errors and blunders, wasted time and squandered opportunities, would overwhelm us. It would be nigh impossible for a religiously sensitive person to ward off depression. "What could have been...What I should have done..." The questions are endless, and their ramifications could have been shocking and shackling. Indeed, the failure to exercise the <I>koach</I> of <I>hischadshus</I> is one cause of depression when one is trapped in the mire of the past.</P>
<P>The capacity for <I>hischadshus</I>, however, while allowing us to productively dwell on the past long enough to recognize and regret our misdeeds, enables us to repent and immerse ourselves in the present; to be sustained and even enthralled by today's accomplishments. We have a remarkable capacity for self-renewal and regeneration (i.e., <I>teshuvah</I>) and an equally remarkable capacity to live in and enjoy the renewed present.</P>
<P>The second manifestation of our <I>koach hischadshus</I> is the ability to persevere in the face of adversity. This too is a vital, indispensable quality because most, if not all, people encounter some type of turbulence - personal, professional, financial, spiritual, etc. - during their lives. Such periods of turbulence can be protracted. Lacking the capacity for self-renewal and regeneration, one would have become enervated, gradually but inexorably sapped of his strength, both physical and spiritual. Sadly, we are all too familiar with the consequences when the <I>koach hischadshus</I> is not utilized. God forbid, one's <I>emunah</I> and will to live gradually erode. The <I>koach hischadshus</I>, when exercised, allows us to persevere and prevail, steadfast in our faith and forever optimistic. "<I>Hein yiktileni lo ayacheil.</I>"</P>
<P>Finally, the capacity for <I>hischadshus </I>is critical in the realm of <I>talmud Torah</I>. The ability to discover and formulate <I>chidushei Torah</I> which is essential to the entire endeavor of <I>talmud Torah </I>and <I>masorah</I> is but a component of the broader capacity of <I>hischadshus</I>.</P>
<P>In light of the above subsumption of <I>koach hachidush</I> in Torah as part of the broader <I>koach hischadshus</I>, we can now recognize that the foregoing depiction of Chanukah as a <I>yom tov</I> of <I>hischadshus</I> encompasses the well-known identification of Chanukah as  a <I>yom tov</I> of <I>Torah Shebaal Peh</I> because <I>Torah Shebaal Peh </I>is distinguished from <I>Torah Shebichsav</I> and characterized by its capacity for <I>chidush</I>.</P>
<P>Having surveyed the crucial role of <I>hischadshus</I> within our lives, two fundamental questions remain. What is the source of this remarkable miraculous capacity? How do we tap this source so as to cultivate this vital capacity? The answer is provided by Shlomo HaMelech who writes in <I>Megilas Koheles</I> that, "there is nothing new under the sun". Mundane pursuits, when not elevated by the impulse and goal of <I>l'sheim shomayim</I>, are not new. Whatever novelty one initially experiences in mundane matters eventually wears off, together with its attendant joy, enjoyment and excitement. Even the routine of the fabulously rich, undoubtedly the object of jealously to others less fortunate, becomes stultifying. This too is a phenomenon all too readily observable. People abandon successful careers or hazard risky investments in an attempt to generate excitement. In their pursuit of pleasure, people literally risk life and limb because they are plagued by the ennui resulting from the fact that "there is nothing new under the sun". However, as noted by Chazal, Torah is above time; it preceded and hence transcends time and is thus forever new (as is <I>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</I> himself, and <I>"kudsha brich hu v'oraysa chad hu"</I>) and accordingly the source for <I>hischadshus</I>. When one immerses himself in Torah and <I>mitzvos</I>, and elevates his otherwise mundane pursuits by the impulse and goal of <I>l'sheim shomayim</I>, one draws from the wellsprings of <I>hischadshus</I>.</P>
<P>This was the <I>middah</I> of Yosef <I>HaTzadik</I>. When Yaakov charges Yosef with the fateful task of going to his brothers, Yosef responds "<I>hineini</I>". Rashi comments that this reflects <I>zrizus</I>, alacrity. Alacrity flows from <I>koach hischadshus</I>. Throughout his years of suffering and imprisonments, Yosef does not despair. He perseveres. His own tragic plight and suffering notwithstanding, he remains sensitive to the plight of others, as evidenced by his concern for the <I>sar hamashkim</I> and <I>sar haofim</I>. This perseverance is also a manifestation of the capacity for <I>hischadshus</I>. And throughout his odyssey Yosef <I>HaTzadik</I> was sustained by the Torah he learned from Yaakov (he remembered exactly where their last lesson had ended!), <I>Talmud Torah</I> being both a source and manifestation of <I>hischadshus</I>. Hence the <I>parshiyos</I> of <I>VaYeishev</I> and <I>Miketz</I> - i.e., the <I>parshiyos</I> of Yosef - provide the <I>krias HaTorah</I> backdrop for Chanukah.</P>

<P>"They should eat the flesh on that
night &#150; roasted over the fire - and <I>matzos</I>;
with bitter herbs they shall eat it"(<I>Shemos</i> 12:8)</P>
<P>
Hillel's
understanding of this verse serves as the source for his original and
our mimetic practice of eating <I>matzo</I> and <I>marror</I>
together. (<i>Pesachim</i> 115a. Vide Hagahos MahaRav Ranshburg ad locum.) <I>Primo facie</I> this <I>mitzvah</I> appears to be
anomalous because it seemingly incorporates antithetical elements
within a single <I>mitzvah</I>. <I>Matzo</I> symbolizes and
commemorates redemption "[It is a <I>mtzvah</I> to eat] <I>matzo
</I>because [our ancestors] were redeemed" (ibid 116b). <I>Marror</I>,
on the other hand, symbolizes and commemorates bitter servitude "[It
is a <I>mitzvah</I> to eat] <I>marror</I> because the Egyptians
embittered the lives of our ancestors in Egypt" (ibid). What
message does this seemingly anomalous <I>mitzvah</I> convey?</P>
<P>

In truth, the
dialectical merging of the symbols for redemption and servitude
occurs within the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>matzo</I> itself. Not only is
<I>matzo</I> the quintessential symbol of redemption, but
simultaneously it evokes images of suffering and slavery. In fact, we
accentuate this dimension of <I>matzo</I> in our introduction to
<I>maggid</I> "This is the poor man's bread that our ancestors
ate in Egypt" (Vide Ramban to <I>Devarim</i> 16:2).</P>
<P>

Upon reflection,
this apparent anomaly points us to a profound, enhanced understanding
of the relationship between suffering and redemption within Hashem's
providential scheme. Redemption does not represent the end or
negation of suffering; instead it is the culmination of suffering.
Redemption is an outgrowth rather than a reversal of suffering.
Accordingly, <I>matzo</I> simultaneously symbolizes both suffering
and redemption. Moreover, <I>matzo</I> and <I>marror</I> merge
because in Hashem's master providential plan suffering forges
redemption.</P>
<P>

Bnei Yisroel
emerged from the iron furnace of Egypt poised to become an unique
nation, the chosen people. Their national character &#150; merciful,
modest, and kind (Yevamos 79a) &#150; had been forged in the suffering of
<I>Mitzrayim. </I>Accordingly, the Torah constantly reinforces our
collective memory "that you were strangers in the land of
Mitzrayim" (Shemos 22:20). The <I>matzo</I> of the fifteenth of Nissan
"because they were redeemed" (ibid 116b) was clearly the
culmination of the <I>matzo</I> of suffering and servitude (Vide Ramban to <I>Devarim</i> 16:2).</P>

<P>This perspective on
the relationship between suffering and redemption has sustained and
nourished <I>Kelal Yisroel</I> throughout the generations. May it
continue to sustain and nourish us, individually and collectively,
until the coming of <I>Moshiach, bimherah be-yamenu, amen.</I></P>

<P>In the period between Purim and Pesach, it is instinctive to analyze a passage in the Talmud which deals with both holidays. The Gemara says in Megillah (14a), "If <I>shira</I> was said when we were delivered from slavery to freedom at <I>yetzias mitzrayim</I>, then when we are delivered from death to life we must certainly say <I>shira</I>". This is the source for the <I>mitzvah</I> of reading the <I>megillah</I> on Purim, and would obligate us to say <I>Hallel</I> on Purim if not for three technical reasons that the Gemara lists.</P>
<P>Rashi adds that <I>Hallel</I> is <I>shira</I> and the <I>shira</I> of <I>yetzias mitzrayim</I> is <I>Shiras Hayam</I>. This means that <I>Shiras Hayam</I> teaches a <I>halacha</I> for all generations, i.e., if <I>Am Yisroel</I> is delivered from a threat to its life, there is an obligation to say <I>Hallel</I>.</P>
<P>An obvious question can be raised. The <I>Shiras Hayam</I> describes supernatural miracles. But on Purim, no laws of nature were broken. How then can the Gemara derive the obligations of Purim from <I>yetzias mitzrayim</I>? Perhaps only miracles which break natural law obligate us to say <I>shira</I>, but not hidden miracles like those of Purim. In addition, the Gemara in <I>Megillah</I> 10b asks a second question. The angels wanted to say <I>shira</I> the night that the miracle of <I>kriyas yam suf</I> occurred, but <I>Hashem</I> said, "My creatures are drowning in the sea, and you want to say <I>shira</I>?!" Now, if the angels were told not to say <I>shira</I> because the Egyptians were drowning, then why do we say <I>shira</I>? And why do we read the <I>Megillah</I> on Purim?</P>
<P>The Meshech Chochma (<I>Shemos</I> 12:16) answers as follows: "Purim is not celebrated on the anniversary of the victory against our enemies. <I>Am Yisroel </I>does not rejoice over the downfall and death of its foes. We celebrate Pesach because we were saved, not because our enemies perished, and we rejoice and read the <I>Megillah</I> on the day that we rested, the day after the war, when no one died, but we were saved.</P>
<P>For this reason, <I>Hashem</I> included the command to observe the seventh day of Pesach among the <I>mitzvos </I>given to us before we left Egypt, even though the <I>mitzva</I> did not apply in <I>Mitzrayim. Hashem</I> did this to show that the holiday is not to commemorate the drowning of the Egyptians, as its observance was commanded prior to the historical event. It follows from the Meshech Chochma's idea that the <I>Shiras Hayam</I>, which we read on the seventh day of <I>Pesach</I> is recited over our deliverance, and not because of the death of our enemies. </P>
<P>We can now answer the first question as well. Should the <I>Shira</I> be required because of the downfall of our enemies, we would not be able to derive Purim from Pesach. After all, the Egyptians were killed by miraculous events culminating with <I>keriyas yam suf</I> ,  whereas Haman and his followers were destroyed by natural means.</P>
<P>In reality, however, the <I>Shira </I>is required only because we were saved from our enemies. In this context, what is important is not how our enemies perished, but how great the threat against us was. Therefore, if we said <I>shira</I> when we were saved from slavery, we must certainly say <I>shira</I> when saved from death.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">II</P>
<P>We do not recite the full <I>Hallel</I> on the seventh day of Pesach. The Gemara in Erchin (10b) explains that Pesach differs from Sukkos, when <I>Hallel</I>is said every day, because on Pesach the same <I>Musaf</I> offering is brought each day, whereas on Sukkos each day has a different <I>Musaf</I>. However, the Medrash says that Pesach differs because on the seventh day we cannot say full <I>Hallel</I>, since the Egyptians drowned. It would be wrong to recite full <I>Hallel</I> on <I>Chol Hamoed</I> and not on the seventh day which is <I>Yom Tov</I>, so it is omitted on all days after the first.</P>
<P>The Medrash seems to contradict the Gemara, as it gives a different reason as to why we do not say full <I>Hallel</I>. Many answer as follows: the Gemara explains why Pesach's status as a <I>Yom Tov </I>does not obligate us to say <I>Hallel</I> even on the seventh day. The reason is that Pesach is one long <I>Yom Tov</I>, and therefore does not require a new recitation of the full <I>Hallel</I> each and every day, whereas Sukkos is eight different <I>Yomim Tovim</I>, each of which warrants a recitation of the full <I>Hallel</I>. The fact that the <I>Musaf</I> is identical all seven days of Pesach but changes each day of Sukkos indicates this distinction.</P>
<P>The Medrash relates to a different issue: why we do not say <I>Hallel</I> because of the <B>miracles</B> of <I>Kriyas Yam Suf</I>. The reason is that when Hashem's creatures drown in the sea, we should not say <I>shira</I>.</P>
<P>Two questions remain. One, why then did our ancestors say <I>shira</I>? And two, why do we sal <I>Hallel</I> on the first night of Pesach even though our enemies died?</P>
<P>We can answer this question based on a comment of the Netziv.  The Chasam Sofer writes that <I>Hallel</I> on Chanukah is a Torah obligation, as evidenced from the Gemara which derives the <I>mitzva</I> to say <I>Hallel</I> from <I>Shiras Hayam</I>. The Netziv quotes the Gemara in <I>Berachos</I> (14a) that <I>Hallel</I> is a Ravnic commandment. How can we reconcile this statement in <I>Berachos</I> with the Gemara's proof from <I>Shiras Hayam</I> that <I>Hallel </I>is a Torah obligation?</P>
<P>The Netziv writes that the Torah obligation exists only when the miracle occurs. On the subsequent anniversaries, the obligation is Ravnic.</P>
<P>The Ravs did not introduce <I>Hallel</I> on days when our enemies died. Therefore, there is no full <I>Hallel</I> on the seventh day of <I>Pesach. </I>Only Purim, which is celebrated on the following day could have qualified as a day of <I>Hallel</I>.</P>
<P>Our ancestors recited <I>Hallel</I> when the sea split because at that point <I>Hallel</I> was a Torah obligation which had to be discharged even though our enemies dies on that day. On the first night of Pesach we must consider ourselves to have just left Egypt at that moment (as ruled by the Rambam). Therefore, there is a Torah obligation to say <I>Hallel</I>, an obligation that overrides the problem that arises because our enemies died that night. And so the <I>Shira</I>, which is like full <I>Hallel,</I> was said when the sea was split, and full <I>Hallel</I> is said every year on the first night of <I>Pesach</I> but not on the seventh day.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, death threats made by the enemies of <I>Am Yisroel</I>, especially in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> are not a thing of the past. As we celebrated Purim this year, we were effected by the recent murder of innocent Jews by vicious enemies, and the continued threat to our security. We pray to <I>Hashem </I>to deliver us from the threat of death to a life of peace, not because we want our enemies to be destroyed but because we want to be saved. </P>
<P>The Medrash teaches us that the <I>Shiras Hayam</I> is similar to the <I>Hallel</I> we will all sing when the final redemption comes. May we be privileged to join in that great song- <I>bimhera beyameinu - Amen.</P></I>

<P>&#9;The first part of <I>Chumash B'midbar</I> speaks of events directly related to the <I>Hashra'as Hash'china -- </I>the dwelling of the Divine presence -- in the <I>Mishkan.</I>  The counting of the <I>L'viyim (</I>Levites), which began in last week's portion and finished in our <I>parsha, </I>was<I> </I>designed to enumerate those working in the <I>Mishkan.  </I>Similarly, the count of the rest of the tribes was, amongst other reasons, to facilitate <I>Hashra'as Hash'china, </I>since Hashem's presence would only rest on <I>K'lal Yisrael </I>after they had proved their lineage and divided themselves into <I>sh'vatim  </I>(tribes)<I>.  </I>Our <I>parsha </I>also includes the rules of sending the various <I>t'maim -- </I>ritually impure individuals -- outside the camps just created: the <I>Mishkan </I>in the center, surrounded by the camp of the <I>l'viyim </I>and then the camp of the rest of the <I>sh'vatim</I>.  Our <I>parsha </I>ends with a description of the specific, dedicatory offerings brought by the <I>n'si'im.  </I>All of these elements revolve around the <I>Mishkan.  </I>Surprising it is then that the Torah seems to interrupt these connected portions with the commandments concerning the <I>Sotah </I>(adulterous woman) and the <I>Nazir.</I></P>
<P>&#9;Perhaps we can suggest a resolution based on a well-known answer to a difficulty in the entire last section our <I>parsha.  </I>All of the <I>n'si'im </I>offered exactly the same <I>korbanos; </I>yet, the Torah carefully describes each prince's offerings in detail. Many explain that this repetition teaches us a fundamental principal in Judaism. Although we are all bound by the same 613 <I>mitzvos </I>and are prohibited from seeking out other forms of Divine service -- which only lead to disastrous results as in the case of Nadav and Avihu, the episode of the Golden Calf, Korach's rebellion and others -- each member of <I>K'lal Yisrael </I>brings his unique personality with him in his performance of the <I>mitzvos.  </I>The Midrash Rabba elaborates that although each <I>nasi </I>brought the same <I>korbanos, </I>the intended symbolism was different in each case.  Similarly, all learn the same Torah; yet, we have our great <I>Poskim, </I>outstanding Torah lecturers, learners of <I>Daf Yomi, </I>those who excel in the study of <I>aggada </I>and <I>hashkafa</I>, and those who learn basic <I>halacha.  </I>Rav Z. H. Chajes <I>zt"l</I> even notes that there were two academies in the time of the Talmud: one for <I>Aggada</I> and one for Halacha. This is why, he notes, that certain <I>amora'im </I>(Talmudic sages) are rarely quoted in matters of Halacha but are abundantly quoted in areas of <I>Aggada.  </I>Similarly, concerning <I>mitzvos, </I>our tradition allows for varying amounts of time spent on one <I>mitzva </I>at the expense of another and vice-versa depending on the individual, all within the system of Halacha. <I> </I>Already in the times of the Talmud, <I>amorai'm </I>had different approaches to the proper balance of time devoted to prayer versus study (see <I>Shabbos </I>10a).   A prominent, contemporary Rav<I> </I>once noted that these diverse postitions seem to have carried over to some extent in the different approaches of the Lithuanian Yeshiva world and their disciples as opposed to the Chassidic world.</P>
<P>&#9;Rav Menachem M. Schneerson <I>zt"l, </I>the late Lubavitcher Rebbe, noted that this dialectic of diversity within sameness is indicated by the two prime celestial bodies which govern the structure of the Jewish calendar.  Whereas the months are lunar, the year is solar (hence the need for "leap months" to keep the calendar synchronized with the solar seasons).  The moon constantly changes; the sun is constant.  The mission of the Jew is to merge both qualities: within the solar-like sameness of the <I>mitzvos, </I>to carve out his unique lunar-like niche.</P>
<P>&#9;Partaking of the physical pleasures of the world within moderation for the purpose of nurturing the body and providing the necessary physical happiness to serve as the backdrop for <I>'avodas Hashem</I> is the approach the Torah advocates for most. Indeed, R. Elazar HaKapar teaches us that the <I>Nazir </I>is referred to as having sinned because he abstained from wine (see Rashi 6:11). But yet, the <I>Nazir</I> is referred to as a <I>"Kadosh" </I>(holy one) (6:8)!  The resolution seems to be found in Rashi's comment (6:2) from the Talmud explaining the juxtaposition of the <I>parsha</I> of <I>Sotah </I>with that of <I>Nazir.  </I>One who sees the humiliation of a s<I>otah </I>in the <I>Mikdash </I>should become a <I>nazir.  </I>This statement seems to be teaching us that one who discovers that he is prone to misuse physicality for the wrong ends, leading to immorality should separate temporarily from some of the generally permissible pleasures of the world until his attitude can be modified.  This is similar to the approach the Rambam outlines in <I>Hilchos Dei'os</I> for one who finds himself weak in a particular characteristic.  His cure is to temporarily adopt the other extreme of the quality in question.  The Kli Yakar notes that the <I>passuk</I> that criticizes the <I>nazir</I> for "sinning" is in the context of one who became <I>tamei </I>in the middle of the nazirite period and must restart it. Therefore his abstention was in vain.  A <I>nazir</I> who utilizes his period of rest from <I>'olam hazeh</I> for a spiritual goal is called a <I>kadosh.  </I>Here too, we find diversity within the basic structure of the Torah.  Perhaps this is why the Torah places this <I>parsha </I>before that of the <I>n'si'im.</I></P>
<P>&#9;The natural desire to be unique should never be used to distance oneself from normative, Halachic practice.  Rather, it must be channeled to find one's unique role within the inherent diversity present within the same 613 <I>mitzvos.</I></P>

<P>Our <I>parasha</I>  presents us
with the first seven plagues visited upon the Egyptian people as a
display of Divine omnipotence and retribution.  Many commentaries
both on the Torah and the Passover Haggadah note the repeating
pattern of sets of three <I>makkot</I>.  The first two were preceded
by Moshe&#146;s warning to Pharaoh to release his Jewish slaves or
else suffer the Divine consequences. The third of the set was not
accompanied by any such warning. In last year&#146;s TorahWeb D&#146;var
Torah (<a href="../../2000/parsha/rhab_bo.html">On Makkot and Scientific Endeavors</a>), we addressed one
approach to the first two <I>makkot</I> of each set.  This year, we
wish to delve into the purpose of the third, warning-less plague.</P>

<P >	Most commentaries explain that after
having ignored the Divine word brought by His prophet twice, Pharaoh
deserved punishment without prior warning.  Perhaps we can suggest an
alternative explanation.  R. Chaim Shmuelevitz, zt&#148;l, the Mirrer
Rosh Yeshiva, in his <U>Sichos Mussar</U> (Ma&#146;amar 2, 5731),
elaborates on Nachmanides&#146; fundamental principle concerning
miracles.  According to the Midrash, Yocheved, the mother of Moshe,
was born upon entry of the nascent Jewish nation into Egypt, bringing
their number to seventy souls (see Genesis 46:26 and Rashi there). 
Now, the exile in Egypt lasted 210 years.  Since Moshe was eighty
years old when he spoke to Pharaoh and shortly thereafter the Jews
left Egypt (see Exodus 7:7), this directly indicates that Yocheved
was 130 when she gave birth to  Moshe.  R. Avraham ibn Ezra, in his
commentary to Genesis (46:23), questions this Midrash. If the Torah
describes the miracle of the birth of Yitzchak to Sarah when she was
90, shouldn&#146;t it certainly describe the miraculous birth of
Moshe to a 130-year-old mother!  Ramban (Nachmanides) defends the
position of the Midrash by stating that only miracles that are
predicted by a prophet are described in the Torah. Other events,
however miraculous they may be, brought about benefit the righteous
or punish the wicked, are not recorded.  R. Shmuelevitz explains the
rationale behind these omissions.  Only miracles predicted accurately
by a prophet would unquestioningly be attributed to G-d by all
observers.  Other, unpredicted miracles might be explained away by a
variety of rational explanations however far-fetched these
explanation might be. The reason, in turn, that not all miracles that
occur are patently miraculous to all is in order to preserve Man&#146;s
free choice.  Whereas he has the option of correctly attributing the
source of the event to G-d, he also may choose otherwise.  R.
Shmuelevitz gives several modern-day examples. A believer would
surely attribute the miraculous rescue of the Mirrer Yeshiva of
Lithuania through Shanghai to direct Divine Providence; the skeptic
would ascribe it to Japanese Consuls and Visas.  Whereas the agnostic
would explain the lightning victory of the Israeli Defense Forces
over the millions-strong Arab invading armies in 1967 to brilliant
military planning on the part of the Israeli generals, jet-fighters,
and tanks, the one who looks beyond the &#147;veil of nature&#148;
would undoubtedly see the &#147;Hand of G-d.&#148;  Many have applied
the same analysis to the recent Persian Gulf War and other major
historic events in our history. Thus, Man himself chooses to see G-d
in the seemingly natural.  He is not forced to do so.</P>

<P>	The <I>makkot</I> in <I>Mitzrayim</I>
were clearly meant to increase awareness of the existence of G-d and
His involvement in human affairs.  The narrative constantly stresses
&#147;I am G-d&#148;, &#147;I am G-d in the midst of the land&#148;,
etc.  Hence, we can suggest that Pharaoh, as representative of his
nation, was presented with two distinct opportunities for recognizing
the Divine Hand.  The first two <I>makkot</I> of each set of three,
were predicted by Moshe, the prophet.  Recognition of G-d under such
circumstances would have been much easier and therefore less
significant.  (Although, even here Pharaoh failed to do so.)  Another
unique, more meaningful opportunity was presented in the third <I>makka</I>
of each set.   These were without a prior, prophetic prediction. 
Seeing <U>these</U> as acts of G-d would be more penetrating and
lasting.</P>

<P>	In our <I>Amida</I> prayer, we
state &#147;and on your miracles that are with us every day.&#148; 
This passage serves to highlight the theme developed above.  We are
charged to remove the &#147;mask of nature&#148; and to see the Hand
of G-d both in our individual lives and in the history of the Jewish
nation.	</P>

<P>One
who studies this week&#146;s <I>Parasha</I> cannot help but feel the
yearning of our teacher par excellence, Moshe Rabbeinu, to enter the
Holy Land of <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>.  &#147;Let me just pass over the
Jordan River and see the good land,&#148; Moshe implores Hashem,
implying even if not as the leader of <I>Klal Yisrael</I>, even if
only for a short time.  Hashem denies his heartfelt request for many
reasons, some explicitly mentioned in the <I>Torah Shebichtav</I> and
some in the Midrashim and subsequent commentaries.  What is the
mystery surrounding this land? </P>

<P>Our
<I>Parasha</I> alludes to the answer.  <I>Chumash D&#146;varim</I>,
as is well known, serves as Moshe&#146;s farewell address to the
<I>B&#146;nei Yisrael.</I>  In it, he reviews the tragic episodes
during the forty-year sojourn in the desert in order that the new
generation learn not to repeat the same mistakes. Moshe also reviews
many of  Hashem&#146;s <I>mitzvot, </I>introducing many new ones as
well.  (See introduction of the <I>Netziv</I> to his commentary
<I>Ha&#146;amek Davar </I>as to the meaning of the alternate name of
our <I>Chumash -- Mishneh Torah</I>.)  Among these <I>mitzvot </I>are
<I>mitzvot ha&#146;t&#146;luyot ba&#146;aretz --</I> those only
applicable in <I>Eretz Yisrael -- </I>and <I>mitzvot </I>binding in
all places and at all times.  Yet, our Parasha stresses several times
(4:5, 4:14) that these <I>mitzvot </I>are being commanded &#147;to do
in the land that you will enter&#148; (see <I>Ha&#146;amek Davar </I>to
4:5).  The difficulty is obvious. Many of the <I>mitzvot </I>that
follow are binding everywhere. Why, then, does the Torah indicate to
fulfill them &#147;in the Land.&#148;</P>

<P>	Rashi
(next week&#146;s Parasha 11:18), commenting on the juxtaposition of
the threat of exile for disobeying Hashem&#146;s commandments and the
<I>mitzvot </I>of <I>t&#146;fillin, talmud Torah, </I>and <I>m&#146;zuza,
</I>quotes a shocking <I>Sifrei.  </I>One might have thought that in
the exile, the <I>mitzvot</I> are not binding, therefore the Torah
instructs us that even in <I>galut, </I>we must keep the
above-mentioned <I>mitzvot </I>as well as all others not dependent on
the Land.  Why? As the prophet Yirmiyahu exhorts: <I>&#147;hatzivi
lach tziyunim&#148; -- </I>&#147;establish signs&#148; for yourself
in order to assure that you not forget their observance so that when
you finally return to the Land of Israel that you know how to
properly perform the <I>mitzvot.  </I>Ramban, in his commentary to
the same verse, alludes to his earlier statements on <I>Chumash
B&#146;raishis</I> where he elaborates on this theme and demonstrates
that G-d is known as <I>&#147;Elokei ha&#146;aretz,&#148;</I> and
therefore only in <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> do His commandments achieve
their full significance.  Although <I>mitzvot </I>not dependent on
the land are equally as binding by Torah law in <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>
and <I>Chutz La&#146;aretz, </I>the nature of their fulfillment is
fundamentally different. In the former land, they are primary, in the
latter they are reminders of how to fulfill them!</P>

<P>	Indeed,
when Avraham Avinu is chosen by the <I>Ribono Shel Olam </I>to found
the nation which would eventually accept the Torah at <I>Har Sinai,
</I>he is told by Hashem, &#147;and to your children I will give this
land&#148; (<I>Lech L&#146;cha 12:7).</I>  Why didn&#146;t Hashem
first mention the giving of the Torah to his descendants before the
promise of <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>?  Rav Tzuriel suggests that they are
one and the same.  When Hashem promised the Land of Israel to
Avraham, He was not merely giving him a homeland in which his
children would live; He promised that his children would be given the
opportunity to keep the Torah in the land designated for its
fulfillment for that is the essence of <I>Eretz Yisrael </I>(see
T&#146;hillim 105:44-45).</P>

<P>	There
has been much discussion in recent years concerning the nature of the
<I>mitzva </I>of <I>yishuv Eretz Yisrael</I> in times of <I>galut. 
</I>(See, for example, <U>RJJ Journal of Halacha and Contemporary
Society</U>, Vol. 5, &#147;The Mitzva of Yishuv Eretz Yisrael&#148;,
by Rav H. Schachter <I>shlit&#148;a</I> and <U>Contemporary Halakhic
Problems,</U> Vols. I-II, by Rav J. D. Bleich <I>shlit&#148;a</I>.) 
Positions range from obligatory <I>(mitzva chiyuvit) </I>to optional
<I>(mitzva kiyumit) </I>to not binding at all <I>. </I>It is not the
intention of this article to indicate which position is the normative
<I>halacha</I>.  But, all would seem to agree as to the centrality of
living in the Holy Land at all times in <I>avodat Hashem</I>. (See
<A href = "http://www.torahweb.org/torah/2000/parsha/rsch_matos-masei.html">The Boundaries of the Land</a>, by Rav H. Schachter, on
TorahWeb.org for additional aspects of Eretz Yisrael.)   A cursory
glance at the Rambam in <I>Hilchot M&#146;lachim</I>, based primarily
on the <I>G&#146;mara </I>at the end of<I> K&#146;tubot,</I>
highlights the immense spiritual value of dwelling in <I>Eretz
Yisrael. </I>And this is true even though, according to some, the
Rambam does not consider dwelling in the Land of Israel an obligatory
commandment (although many authorities maintain that even the Rambam
views it as obligatory but did not count it as a <I>mitzva </I>for
technical reasons -- see the above articles for further discussion). 
This stresses that the <I>ma&#146;ala ruchanis -- </I>spiritual
benefit -- gained from living in the <I>armon haMelech -- </I>the
palace of the King is quite independent from the binding nature of
the <I>mitzva </I>of <I>aliya </I>(see Volume II of <U>Contemporary
Halakhic Problems</U> for further discussion of this point).    The
current crisis in <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>, bringing to the forefront of
our consciousness the fact that we cannot take this gift for granted,
must motivate us to reexamine our commitment to these concepts. If
the <U>main</U> place of <I>kiyum hamitzvot </I>is in <I>Eretz
Yisrael, </I>does one have a right to remain in <I>Chutz La&#146;aretz?
 </I>Sometimes the answer is yes for religious, family, financial, or
other reasons (see Pischei T&#146;shuva Even Haezer 75).  But,
oftentimes the decision to remain is made by lack of serious thought
as to the centrality of <I>Eretz Yisrael </I>in our Torah.  It
behooves every religious Jew to investigate the feasibility of
enhancing his <I>avodas Hashem </I>by seeking out ways and means to
settle in <I>Eretz HaKodesh. </I>
</P>

<P><I>	</I>In
the words of Rav Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld <I>zt&#148;l, </I>famous Rav
of Yerushalayim, every Jew will have to answer in heaven as to why he
did not live his life in the Land of Israel.  If these words were
stated at the turn of the century, when living in <I>Eretz haKodesh</I>
was fraught with difficulties in terms of finding schooling,
employment, and medical care, then all the more so, should we, who
have been <I>zoche </I>to see the <I>yad Hashem </I>in our Land
becoming a world center of Torah learning and Yeshivos, as well as
economically successful, consider these words seriously.</P>

<P>	It
is no wonder then, that Moshe <I>Rabbeinu</I> desired entry into the
Promised Land even if for a short time.  May we learn from our
teacher&#146;s example!</P>

<P>&#9;"<I>Vayanas vayeitsei hachutzah</I>" -- "and he fled and went outside" (39:12).  With this terse phrase, the Torah describes Yosef's flight from the enticements of the wife of Potiphar. Although <I>Chazal</I> dispute whether or not Yosef was in any way tempted to sin, in the end, he clearly conquered temptation and fled without any regard for the consequences that might befall him for his courageous stance.  As a result of his actions, Yosef is crowned throughout history as "<I>Yosef HaTzaddik</I>" -- "Joseph the Righteous."</P>
<P>&#9;<I>Midrash Rabba</I> attributes the miracle of the Splitting of the Red Sea to the merit of Yosef's flight.  It bases this connection on the similar phraseology used in both episodes.  Concerning Yosef, the Torah states "<I><U>vayanas</I></U>"; regarding <I>K'riyas Yam Suf</I>, <I>T'hillim</I> poetically describes: "<I>hayam ra'ah <U>vayanos</I></U>" -- "the Sea saw and fled (split)" (114:3).  What is the inner connection between the miraculous salvation of <I>B'nai Yisrael <B> </B></I>through the parting of the Sea and the actions of our ancestor Yosef?</P>
<P>&#9;Rav C. Y. Goldwicht <I>zt"l</I>, the founding Rosh HaYeshiva of Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh, explained the connection as follows.  Yosef, 17 years old at the time of the attempted seduction, was at the age of a natural heightened desire. (Indeed, the <I>Midrash </I>comments that a Roman matron, questioning R. Yose, could not believe that a human being in such a situation would be able to overcome such a great temptation.)  Away from the spiritual environment of Ya'akov Avinu's home, surrounded by the alluring Egyptian culture and the promise of advancement in its society which might be open to him if he would cave in to the demands of his master's wife, Yosef was clearly in an extremely tempting predicament.  Yet, through depicting the image of his saintly father Ya'akov's image in his mind's eye (see Rashi), he was able to overcome his natural desire.  This, in essence, was a victory over the <I>natural</I>, innate tendency of human beings.  Consequently, Hashem, <I>midda k'negged midda </I>(measure for measure), changed the natural order of the world where waters flow and do not stand still as walls and forced them to change their <I>nature</I> and part for <I>B'nei Yisrael.  Nefesh HaChayim </I>(1:8-9) expounds upon the theme found in <I>T'hillim</I>: "<I>Hashem tzil'cha 'al yad y'minecha</I>" -- "G-d is your shadow on your right hand."  Just as a shadow behaves as a mirror-image of the individual, so too Hashem acts toward us as we act toward Him.  If we act supernaturally by overcoming desire, Hashem performs supernatural miracles for us.</P>
<P>&#9;A similar theme can be found concerning the first of the <I>Avos.  </I>Dispelling Avraham Avinu's concern over his lack of children at his advanced age, Hashem takes Avraham outside -- "vayotsei 'oso hachutza (15:5)."  Rashi comments that he took him out of the terrestrial atmosphere.  Rav Goldwicht explained that this was a demonstration to Avraham that he and his descendants would not be subject to the regular rules of the earth, the rules of nature.  Since his descendants would be committed to the Almighty's Torah in a supernatural way, Hashem would protect his children in a like fashion.  Similarly, the Talmud in Shabbos (156b) teaches us "<I>ein mazal l'yisrael,</I>" Jews are not subject to the influence of the constellations, i.e. the rules of nature.  As a proof to this idea, the <I>G'mara</I> recounts the story of R. Akiva's daughter whom the astrologers predicted would die on her wedding night through the bite of a snake.  Upon awakening the morning after the wedding, the<I> kallah </I>noticed that she had inadvertently skewered an asp during the evening which would have obviously killed her had she not done so.  After her father questioned her as to what merit saved her, she responded that upon seeing a pauper at her wedding to whom no one attended, she immediately offered him her own portion of food.  How is this episode a proof to the premise of  "<I>ein mazal l'yisrael?"</I>  R. Akiva's daughter was clearly saved in the merit of the <I>mitzva </I>of charity; otherwise, she would have perished by the "laws of nature!"  What clearly emerges then is that when and only when <I>K'lal Yisrael</I> act in a manner against their own nature (such as caring for another on the night of one's personal joy), the laws of nature cease to apply to them.  (See the <I>G'mara</I> for additional examples.)</P>
<P>&#9;The <I>m'sirus nefesh, </I>extreme selflessness, of the <I>Chashmona'im</I> in battling against the Greek attempt to abolish Torah Judaism was a remarkable demonstration of rising beyond normal human limitations. It is not surprising that Yosef, one of our ancestors that implanted this ability within us, seems to be alluded to in the Midrash concerning Chanuka 
(see <a href="http://www.torahweb.org/torah/1999/moadim/rhab_chanu.html">Wisdom for a Purpose</a>).  <I>K'lal Yisrael </I>and indeed the entire world are under attack by those who would use misguided, corrupted <I>m'sirus nefesh</I> to kill, maim, and injure innocents.  As we approach the holiday of <I>m'sirus nefesh, </I>our task is clear: to rise above our apparent limitations to excel in <I>Torah</I>, <I>T'filla</I> and <I>Chessed</I>, transcending our very nature, so that we merit special, miraculous Divine protection that we so sorely need.</P>

<P>The Torah outlines for us in this
week&#146;s <I>parasha,</I> four types of <I>korbanot </I>--
offerings. <I>Olah, Sh&#146;lamim, Chatat, Asham.  </I>The <I>Olah</I>
offering was unique in that, with the exception of the hide which was
given to the <I>Kohanim, </I>it was entirely consumed on the
<I>mizbei&#146;ach.</I>  For the remaining three, only parts of the
animal, the <I>eimurim</I>, were offered on the altar, whereas the
remaining parts of the animal were eaten subject to various time and
place requirements (see <I>Mishnayot</I> <I>Z&#146;vachim Perek
Eizehu M&#146;koman</I>).  With two of these three, the <I>Chatat</I>
and the <I>Asham, </I>only the <I>Kohanim </I>were allowed to eat,
whereas with the <I>Sh&#146;lamim, </I>all had a portion.  There was
another type of <I>korban </I>though that, in this regard, was the
opposite of the <I>Olah.</I> The <I>Shtei HaLechem, </I>the two
leavened breads brought on <I>Shavuot, </I>although having the status
of a <I>Mincha -- </I>a meal offering, was <U>entirely</U> consumed
by the <I>Kohanim.  </I>How can we understand this range of
requirements concerning the offerings?</P>

<P>Rav C. Y. Goldwicht <I>zt&#148;l, </I>
the founding Rosh Hayeshiva of Yeshivat Kerem B&#146;Yavneh, noted an
additional anomaly.  Although non-Jews may offer <I>korbanot </I>to
G-d, their only choice is the O<I>lah. </I>Indeed, when Yitro joins
Moshe in the desert, and, according to the tradition of Chazal,
converted, then he joined Aharon and the Elders in partaking of
<I>&#147;z&#146;vachim,&#148; </I> a reference to S<I>h&#146;lamim. 
</I>Why? 
</P>

<P><I>Korbanot  </I>represent <I>Avodah --
</I>service of the Divine.  A central teaching of Judaism, and the
crucial thrust of <I>mitzvot</I>, is the sanctification of every
aspect of the physical world in the service of the Creator.  Indeed,
<I>korbanot </I>spanned the entire range of the physical creation. 
They included minerals (salt), plants (oil, meal), birds (doves,
pigeons), and animals.  It is not surprising then that the <I>korbanot
</I>also reflect the range of Divine service.  Certain <I>mitzvot 
</I>are comparable to the <I>Olah.  </I>On <I>Yom Kippur, </I>we
separate from physicality, and elevate ourselves by devoting the
entire day to <I>ruchniyut -- </I>spirituality.  Others are more
similar to the <I>Sh&#146;lamim -- t&#146;fillin </I>contain portions
of Torah inside but are formed from the hide of animals (both the
parchment and the containers).  (Indeed, Rav Goldwicht noted that one
of the holiest objects in <I>halacha, </I>the <I>seifer Torah, </I>is
formed from a very physical object, animal hide.) Others, however,
are more like the <I>Shtei HaLechem.  </I>On Pesach, we eat <I>matza</I>,
totally physical food, none of which is brought on any <I>mizbei&#146;ach</I>,
and yet it a central <I>mitzva</I>!<I>  </I>Indeed, the Talmud
comments concerning the <I>korbanot</I> that are partially eaten by
the <I>Kohanim</I>, that <I>&#147;kohanim och&#146;lim uv&#146;alim
mitcap&#146;rim&#148; -- </I>the <I>Kohanim </I>eat, and the owners
of the offering achieve atonement.  <I>Halacha </I>even compares the
table at which we eat to a <I>mizbei&#146;ach.  </I>(This is one of
the reasons we keep salt at the table.)</P>

<P>The commentary <I>Kli Chemdah </I>on
Parashat VaYeira notes that the S<I>htei Halechem </I>are offered on
Shavuot, the day of <I>Mattan </I> <I>Torah.  </I>One would have
expected additional <I>Olot </I>instead, wholly brought to G-d! 
Rather, the message of Torah is the elevation of the mundane. <I>&#147;Lo
nit&#146;na Torah l&#146;malachei hashareit&#148; --</I> the Torah
was not given the entirely spiritual angels, it was given to Man --
the composite of <I>n&#146;shama </I>and <I>guf, </I>soul and body,
to convert the physical aspects of himself and the world into the
spiritual.  Therefore, Yitro partakes of a <I>sh&#146;lamim</I> only
after his conversion to highlight this theme of <I>mitzvot.</I></P>

<P>In the temporary absence of the <I>Bait
HaMikdash</I>, when we cannot physically offer <I>korbanot,  </I>may
the study of their laws and significance be viewed by <I>Hakadosh
Baruch Hu, </I>as <I>&#147;un&#146;shal&#146;ma parim s&#146;fateinu&#148;
--</I> &#147;our words should be a substitute.&#148;</P>

<P>Our
<I>minhag</I> to read the comforting words of Yehsayahu <I>Hanavi</I>
as the <I>haftoros</I> of the seven weeks between Tisha B'av and Rosh
Hashana is based on the <I>medrash</I>ic account of Hashem's many
futile attempts to comfort Yerushalayim.  Hashem sends Avrohom,
Yitzchak, Ya'akov and Moshe hoping that each one will find the words
that will soothe the raging wounds of Yerushalayim.  Each one is
disqualified by Yerushalayim until finally Hashem Himself offers
words of <I>nechama</I>.  Certainly we are reminded of this every
time we take leave of a <I>shiva</I> home conceding our inability to
offer satisfactory words of strength and asking Hashem to strengthen
and comfort the bereaved just as He finally acquiesced to
Yerushalyim.
</P>

<P>Accordingly,
many <I>medrashim</I> place this week as the one when Yerushalayim
rejects the idea to hear out Ya'akov and the words he would offer. 
"Ya'akov?", the Holy City seems to say with equal amounts
of disdain and hurt, "Did he not belittle me when he said  'This
is but the house of Hashem'- and you wish to bring him to me now?"
  Apparently Hashem respects Yerushalyim's response that somehow
Ya'akov disqualified himself on the very evening that he spent with
Yerushalyim praying on behalf of his own welfare and destiny when
both seemed to be slipping away rather quickly.

<P>How
are we to understand this discussion which has become ensconced in
<I>minhag Yisrael</I> as we read the "<I>shiva denechamta</I>"
to lift up our spirits after the despair of Tisha B'av morning?  What
would Ya'akov have said?  Is it not unfair to strip one phrase of its
context, "How awesome is this place, this is nothing less the
house of Hashem and this is the gate to Heaven" - the very
phrase that has adorned countless synagogues over the centuries?

<P>No
doubt we can imagine Ya'akov describing that night when he first came
to Yerushalyim feeling very alone without family, uncertain of where
he will find food and clothing and certainly looking forward to a
future of growing ambiguity.  Yerushalyim gave herself to Ya'akov at
that moment and through her sanctity Ya'akov's prayers were accepted
and Hashem Himself reassured Ya'akov.  Ya'akov prevailed and came
back to his father with a new generation on which his future would be
built.

<P>From
Yerushalayim's response we sense that had the awe struck Ya'akov
simply declared how frightening and humbling it is to stand at the
gates of Heaven on earth, he indeed would forever be a source of
strength for Yerushalyim. However adding that Yerushalayim is the
"beis", the home of Hashem,  he at the same time lent the
holiest of places  familiarity  that took away some of the magic of
the moment.  We understand Yerushalayim very well. If we would
forever sense the reverence that Yerushalyim so deserves and never
feel comfort that comes with accessibility that is intimated by one's
home - then Yerushalayim today would look much different.

<P>It
was in response to the cynical remark of a liberal Jewish leader
comparing the respectful decorum of his synagogue to the louder
ambiance of the Orthodox <I>shuls</I>, that Rav Shamshon Rephael
Hirsch retorted that frequency and familiarity generate these
liberties. Whereas Rav Hirsch quickly put his critic in his place, 
his observation regarding the <I>beis hakenesses</I> certainly
concerned  Yeruashalaym.  If only the many times we pour our hearts
out in <I>shul</I> in gratitude and in desperate need would
strengthen our appreciation of the sanctity of the <I>shul</I>, we
would feel very much at home without taking any attendant liberties. 


 <P>Many
a commentary sees this idea in Dovid Hamelech's one request, "that
I may dwell in the house of Hashem... <I>ulevaker </I>- [ literally:
to visit] His <I>Heichal</I>."  In what seems to be
inconsistent, Dovid is indeed asking for the gift of constant access
to Hashem's holiest places and yet to forever  be overwhelmed and awe
struck as a visitor would be.

<P>Perhaps
through our own pursuit of this very difficult balance we can all be
sources of <I>nechama</I> to Yerushalayim and her children.

<P>There is hardly a more penetrating
reminder of the sanctity of a <I>Torah </I>lifestyle and the values
of our <I>mesorah </I>than the annual reading of <I>tazria-metzorah</I>.
 Is there another people who at least once a year focus on the evils
of arrogance and slander; who come to appreciate the ugliness of
<I>loshon hara </I>and the destructive web that it can weave<I>
</I>through a survey of grotesque physical growths  and the tumor
like spread of <I>negaim</I>\leprosy.   
</P>
<P>Yet
unlike any physical ailment  with which we are familiar, and distinct
from almost the entirety of <I>Halocha</I>, determining the status of
a growth, whether it  renders its bearer as a <I>tzorua </I>or not is
entirely in the hands of a <I>kohen</I>.  "(13:2 - 8) [The one
who finds on a growth on his skin] will be brought to to <I>Aharon
Hakohen</I> or to one of his children who are <I>kohanim</I>...and
the <I>kohen </I>will study the growth... and the <I>kohen </I>will
study it on the seventh day... and the <I>kohen </I>will isolate him
for seven days...and the <I>kohen </I>will study again ...and the
<I>kohen </I>will decide and make him <I>tomeh</I>"  Clearly the
expertise of a <I>yisroel  </I>is put aside and a <I>yisroel </I>who
may have mastered  <I>Maseches</I> N<I>egaim </I>with all its
commentaries must still submit to the judgment of  a <I>kohen</I>.   
That is why one who reports his newly discovered growth found  on the
walls of his home, says to the <I>kohen</I>,(14:35)"<I>Kanega</I>-
<I>There  seems</I> to be a growth on the walls of our home". 
Why so circumspect -  "<I>kanega</I>" ?  Explains <I>Rashi
</I>even a <I>talmid chacham</I> that is certain that the growth is a
<I>nega </I>cannot render a definitive decision and must say,
"<I>kanega</I>"  Is it not strange that the one topic that
has been described in <I>Torah Shebichsav</I> with such painstaking
detail is relegated  to the fewest to render a decision??   How can
we account for this;  something which we would not find in <I>issur
vaheter</I> or in <I>shaatnez</I> or <I>ishus</I>??
</P>
<P>Perhaps
this is a process that would make the <I>Metzorah </I>aware of the
vicious power of <I>loshon hara</I>.  Now the way he will be seen by
others and thus  his ability to maintain friends and relationships
for a period of time will all hang on one word that can be uttered by
one <I>kohen</I>.  Surely he will begin to feel the ugly results of
his loose lip.</P>
<P>Furthermore
the <I>metzora </I>will gain a new appreciation of the destructive
course of labels.  For a few weeks his entire life will be devoid of
any complexity as it is simply and narrowly focused on one growth,
its hairs and its changes,  How often do we do the same, taking the
liberty of summarizing the entirety and richness of another's
personality, beliefs and challenges in one word.  Our generation is
almost trained to characterize and often dismiss lives full of
genuineness and depth, passion and purpose via the texture, size and
position of their head cover.  As the <I>metzora</I>'s well-being
hinges on the summary judgment of the <I>kohen </I>or is indeed
determined by a pronouncement, he must begin to recognize that labels
usually close any chance of a colorful and meaningful relationship
with another.
</P>
<P>A
similar instruction arises from the manner in which the <I>kohen
</I>views the possible <I>metzorah</I>,   (12:3) "and the <I>kohen
</I>shall see the <I>nega</I>.... and [the <I>kohen</I>] shall see
him and declare him <I>tomeh</I>"  Based on the <I>sifrei</I>Rav
Meir Simcha points out in the <I>Meshech Chochma,</I>
that first the <I>kohen </I>evaluates the nature of the <I>nega </I>to
see if it must be declared <I>tomeh</I>, then the <I>kohen </I>judges
whether the   person can be declared <I>tomeh</I>; is he a <I>chasan
</I>or is he exempt for a similar reason.  I believe that in this
counter intuitive order there lies a magnificent instruction.  Should
one notice the faults of another - the <I>nega</I> that we all harbor
in varied fashion - then quickly put it into the appropriate
perspective.  Train oneself to  view <I>him</I>, the person,  and 
apply the <I>"ayin tov"</I> to the larger picture, his
struggles and accomplishments into which that very human failing may
fall.  In that way we will not only refrain from any form of tale
bearing and labeling but we will open ourselves up to the  goodness
which abounds around us.
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ever since our earliest years the phrase "<I>chesed l'Avraham</I>" has served to focus us on the selflessness of Avraham <I>Avinu</I> and encourage us to emulate in some manner the magnificent welcome that he extended to the three angels.  We can draw further inspiration and guidance from the careful study of this <I>parsha</I> and its <I>medrashim</I>, even as we have surely grown through helping others and from observing the "masters of <I>chessed</I>" with which our communities have been blessed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While Avraham is lauded for every gracious move and gesture, there is one phrase in this week's <I>parsha</I> in which Avraham offers water to his guests, draws both praise as well as criticism.  Throughout the <I>parsha</I> Avraham personally provides lodging and a hearty meal to his visitors, and speaks to them clearly and without hesitation.  However, when he offers his guests some water, his language becomes formal and convoluted, "Please let there be taken a little water". Chazal noted the change, a formal usage of   "please", the uncharacteristic "a little", and the distancing manner inherent in the passive "let there be taken".  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of Chazal view this as praiseworthy, as one <I>medrash</I> attributes our sustenance during the desert years much later as a reward for Avraham's kindness at that time.  The desert <I>manna</I> came in response to the butter and bread that Avraham provided; the heavenly and protective clouds were a reward for Avraham waiting on the <I>malachim</I>; and the "little water" brought about that miraculous tRaveling well that provided Klal Yisroel with water throughout their forty years of tRaveling. Yet, is it not strange that the provision of a little water won for us the most essential life sustaining divine gift of those years? Furthermore, the order of the presentation in the <I>medrash</I> is inconsistent with the way in which the events actually took place.  This leads me to suggest that the <I>medrash</I> draws our attention to the <U>way</U> that Avraham phrased himself, rather than the substance of his offer. Indeed our sustenance came from heaven much as the milk and butter was brought before the <I>malachim</I>, and we felt Hashem's ever watchful clouds just as Avraham anticipated their every need.  However, upon hearing, "please have yourselves a little water" the <I>malachim</I> were immediately made to feel that satisfying their needs was really <U>no</U> bother at all. That one word "please" allowed the <I>malachim</I> to feel that <U>they</U> were doing a favor for Avraham.  Quite possibly they would no longer focus on the efforts being extended on their behalf.  Much the same, for the vast majority of our years in the desert we came to expect the availability of the well water.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, there is another <I>medrash</I>, quoted by Rashi, that resolves the inconsistent grammar of this phrase in a way that is critical of Avraham.  "Let there be water taken" is meant to instruct Yishmael to bring some water, instead of Avraham running himself as he did with all the other needs of the <I>malachim</I>. Because Avraham held back ever so slightly, the Jews received their water through a messenger, Moshe, whereas the manna and heavenly clouds came directly from Hashem.  At first glance this is very surprising.  Is it not the best of <I>chinuch</I> to involve one's children in acts of <I>chessed</I>? Do we not all assume that including our children in our projects and lifestyles gives us the best shot at establishing them as an enduring legacy? Perhaps Avraham wanted to be soft and feared being pushy; nevertheless, Chazal understood that in this case his thoughtfulness communicated timidity and the manner in which he called upon Yishmael belittled the very task he was assigning to his son. Chazal want us to understand that we should no doubt engage others, and certainly our children, but all the while stressing the great contribution they are making, rather than understating their efforts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How precious is the advice of Hagaon HaRav Yaakov Kaminetzky Tz"l who counseled parents training their children to say <I>berachos</I> as follows, "describe to them in great detail the tumult in heaven as thousands of angels each proclaim the praises of Hashem, and how when a child makes a <I>beracha</I>, everything becomes suddenly quiet so that the <I>beracha</I> can pass directly to the Throne of Glory where it brings immeasurable pleasure to Hashem himself." </P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: bamidbar]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P><I>Parshat Bamidbar</I> marks an important transition in the structure of <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>, in which the Leviim assumed the role hitherto reserved for or at least designated for the <I>bekhorot</I> This change itself raises many issues, as <I>Chazal</I> discuss, calling into question the very purpose of initially infusing the <I>bekhorot</I> with such short-lived <I>kedushah</I>. </P>
<P>The <I>pesukim</I> that describe this development further challenge us to understand both the nature of this transition, as well as the prevailing character of <I>keduashat bekhor</I>. Even as the Torah continually stresses, with the word "<I>li</I>", the total commitment and dedication that Hashem will demand from the <I>Leviim</I> (<I>Bamidbar</I> 3:12,41, 45- "<I>ve-hayu li halviim</I>" etc.), the Torah also characterizes not only the initial, but also the continuing status of the replaced <I>bekhor</I> in the same terms! Thus, we note the triple usage of "<I>li</I>" in the <I>pasuk</I> that concludes Hashem's instructions to Moshe on this matter (<I>Bamidbar</I> 3:13)- "<I>ki li kol bekhor be-yom hakoti kol bekhor be-eretz mizrayim hiqdashti li kol bekhor be-yisrael me-adam ad behemah li yihiyu ani Hashem</I>" (see Bekhorot 5a). </P>
<P>The Torah discusses the <I>mitzvah</I> and status of <I>bekhor</I> differently in various contexts. In <I>parshat Bamidbar</I>, <I>bekhor's</I> special status, which at least partially seemingly persists, is explicitly linked to <I>makat bekhorot</I>, even as the transition to the <I>Leviim</I> is formulated. In <I>parshat Bo</I> (<I>Shemot</I> 13:2), also in the context of the commemoration of <I>yetziat Mizrayim</I>, we are informed that the <I>bekhor</I> is to be sanctified- "<I>kadesh li kol bekhor peter kol rehem be-benei yisrael ba-adam u-babehemah li hu</I>". The Neziv (Haamek Davar, ad. loc.) questions how this act of sanctification is manifest upon a child. [<I>Chazal</I> in other contexts argue that <I>kedushah</I> signifies <I>perishah</I>-separation. See Rambam, <I>Hil</I>. <I>Bekhorot</I> 1:1.] In <I>parshat</I> Korah (<I>Bamidbar</I> 18:15), perhaps linked with the mitzvah of <I>bikurim</I> (18:13) (see Sefer ha-Hinukh ,no. 40, and Moreh Nevukhim), the Torah underscores the need to redeem the <I>bekhor</I>: "<I>akh padoh tifdeh eit bekhor ha-adam</I>...". </P>
<P>While the connection to <I>makat bekhorot</I> dramatizes the distinctive status of <I>bekhor</I> and underscores the need for one manifestation of "<I>ki li hu</I>", that of total dedication to <I>avodat Hashem</I> unambiguously defined, the link to <I>bikurim</I> perhaps implies a more general theme of "<I>ki li hu</I>", according to which the <I>bekhor</I> constitutes an appropriate representative of the broader population of <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>. Moreover, the obligations to sanctify and redeem appear irreconcilable. Indeed, the Rashbam argues that the formulation in <I>parshat Bo</I> reflects only the status of <I>bekhor</I> before the transition, while the <I>pesukim</I> in Korah refer to the contemporary. The Rambam actually omits reference to human <I>bekhorot</I> when he codifies the <I>mitzvah</I> <I>of "kadesh li kol bekhor</I>" in Sefer ha-Mizvot (aseh no. 89), although the actual source in Bo includes both animal and human <I>bekhorot</I>. However, Seforno projects that the themes of <I>kedushah</I> and <I>pidyon</I> are compatible. The standard <I>pidyon ha-ben</I> ceremony includes the <I>pasuk</I> of "<I>kadesh li</I>" immediately after the <I>pasuk</I> of "<I>u-peduyo mi-ben hodesh tifdeh</I>". In fact, the Rambam in Yad ha-Hazakah does include human <I>bekhorot</I> in the mitzvah of "<I>le-hafrish bekhorot</I>", codified in <I>Hil. Bekhorot </I>(1:1), even as he projects the mitzvah of <I>pidyon bekhorot</I> in <I>Hil. Bikurim</I> (11:1). </P>
<P>An examination of the ceremony of <I>pidyon ha-ben</I> reveals other facets of this mitzvah that require clarification. The great joy that is reflected in the ceremony and accompanying formulae convey that this <I>pidyon</I> is perceived not as an unfortunate derogation of status, or loss of spiritual opportunity, but as an authentic expression of spiritual ambition and an affirmation of <I>kedushat Yisrael</I>. Some formulations conclude the <I>berakahah</I> with "<I>mekadesh yisrael le-pidyonam</I>", though this is not our normative practice. </P>
<P>Perhaps the significance of <I>pidyon ha-ben</I> lies precisely in the very fact that the mitzvah of <I>pidyon</I> does not completely negate the initial <I>mitzvat kedushah</I> or render superfluous (or spiritually insignificant) the prior state of <I>perishah</I>. The fact that the principle of "<I>ki li kol bekhor</I>" persists on the basis of "<I>li yihiyu</I>" despite the transition of the <I>avodah</I> to the <I>Leviim</I> may be responsible for the special joy and singular spiritual meaning associated with <I>pidyon ha-ben</I>. Notwithstanding the subsequent exclusion of <I>bekhorot</I> from the actual <I>avodah</I>, this perspective effectively conveys the ideal that the opportunity to serve in that elite capacity was initially and in some (abstract) respects still remains the potential legacy of every single family of <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>. Furthermore, it accents that <I>shevet</I> Levi continues to serve as the representatives of that original integrated population. Moreover, a joyous <I>pidyon</I> that reflects and affirms initial <I>kedushah</I> even in absence of the actual potential to serve and which anticipates a spiritually rich life of torah and <I>yirat shamayim</I> as conveyed in the accompanying formula ("<I>ve-yikanes zeh ha-ben le-hayyim, le-torah u-leyirat shamayim...she-kesheim she-nikhnas le-pidyon ken yikaness le-torah u-le-hupah, u-le-maasim tovim</I>"), not despite but because of the <I>pidyon</I>, is one that truly reflects a profound theme of <I>kedushat yisrael</I>. It powerfully projects that "<I>ki li kol bekhor</I>" and all that it implies, transcends the <I>avodah</I> and can be channeled, manifested and expressed in ways that are also accessible to all members of <I>kelal yisrael</I>. In this way, the otherwise distinct themes of <I>makat bekhorot</I> and <I>bikurim</I>, of Hil. Bekhorot (<I>kedushah-avodah</I>) and Hil. Bikurim (<I>reishit-pidyon</I>) converge bearing the singular message of "<I>ki li kol bekhor be-yom hakoti kol bekhor be-eretz mizrayim hiqdashti li kol bekhor be-yisrael me-adam ad beheimah li yihiyu Ani Hashem</I>". </P>

		<title><![CDATA[The Contribution of the <I>Ivri</I> Concept to Jewish Nationhood]]></title>

		<content><![CDATA[



<I><P>Sefer Shemot</I> marks an important transition in the development of Jewish history. While <I>Sefer Bereishit </I>focuses on the role of the individual <I>avot</I> in shaping the beginnings of <I>kelal yisrael</I>, it is <I>Sefer Shemot</I> which highlights the fate of the nation itself. Thus, at the very outset of the <I>Sefer</I> (1:1), we read of "<I>benei yisrael</I>" even as the small group of individuals who comprise the entire nation are delineated: "<I>Ve-eileh shemot benei yisrael ha-baim mizraymah, et Yaakov ish u-beito bau</I>". When the Torah chronicles the proliferation of <I>kelal yisrael</I> (1:7) and the harsh reaction it engendered (1:9,12,13) it refers to the nation as "<I>benei yisrael</I>". </P>
<P>Given this context, it is particularly interesting that in relating the counter response of the "<I>meyaldot</I>" the Torah abandons the term "<I>yisrael</I>", opting instead for the name "<I>ivriyot</I>" (1:15-22), previously used in connection with both Avraham and Yosef in Bereishit. Moreover, while the term appears 7 times scattered throughout Bereishit, it appears 8 times just in this concentrated section in the beginning of Shemot, notwithstanding the fact that "<I>yisrael</I>" is now a more obvious alternative, especially as the focus appears to be the total history of the nation! </P>
<P>To appreciate the significance of this phenomenon, we need to examine the context and determine the implications of this term. The Neziv argues that the fledgling nation had seriously mis-stepped by improperly integrating themselves into the broader society of Egypt- "<I>va-temalei ha-aretz otam</I>"-, revealing a serious misconception of their true mission. Even if they were also charged to impact upon the broader civilization, perhaps to be an "<I>or la-goyim</I>" (see Neziv intro. to Shemot), they were to accomplish this goal not by diluting their uniqueness or compromising their standards, but by projecting their principles and ideals in an unambiguous manner. They were challenged to build this particular nation without losing the qualities of courage, faith, and unswerving dedication to principle that normally characterize special individuals. The principled, heroic conduct of a group of remarkable individuals, the <I>meyaldot</I>, reflected this aspiration. By defying the cruel edict of the King of Egypt, the <I>meyaldot</I> exhibited extraordinary courage and exemplified the intense dedication to their fellow Jews and absolute commitment to <I>yirat Hashem</I> that must define Jewish nationhood even in pressured situations. Their response may have seemed stubborn and even irrational to others, but it reflected a critical component in Jewish nationhood, and was precisely the appropriate antidote to counter the excesses of "<I>va-temalei ha-aretz otam</I>", as perceived by the Neziv. </P>
<P>These indispensable qualities, first associated with Avraham, the "<I>av hamon goyim</I>" (father of the nation), are conveyed by the term "<I>ivri</I>" with which he is identified. When Avraham was approached by the "<I>palit</I>" to involve himself in a massive war just to save his nephew Lot, he is addressed as "<I>ivri</I>"(Bereishit 14:13, and see Seforno). The <I>pasuk</I> (Bereishit 14:13) emphasizes that Avraham acted despite the fact that Lot had willingly chosen a different fate- "<I>ve-hu yoshev be-sedom</I>". Avraham's response reflected not irrationality, but a principled and idealistic stance <I>vis a vis</I> his nephew who was in crisis. <I>Hazal</I> explain that the term "<I>ivri</I>" <I>("Avraham be-zad ehad ve-kol ha-olam be-zad aher</I>") connotes Avraham's capacity to resist any pressure and his willingness to stand alone if need be for the sake of principle, notwithstanding his avowed mission to impact upon others. Apparently, the dimension of "<I>ivri</I>" had become somewhat neglected as other important components that contribute to the necessary complex balance of "<I>yisrael</I>" (symbolized by the complex "<I>tiferet</I>") developed. </P>
<P>The term "<I>ivri</I>" surfaces with respect to Yosef, as well, as he faces formidable challenges in a totally hostile and alien environment. His ability to maintain his uniqueness, project his ideals and withstand temptation and the pressures to conform which qualify him for a leadership role have their origin in his "<I>ivri</I>" roots. Ramban (Ber. 40:15) explains that this term always underscores the singular nature of the Jewish people and their unwillingness to conform or assimilate. He adds that this characteristic is an eternal legacy of the Jewish people: <I>" hihziqu shemam ivrim shelo yitarvu be-amei ha-aratzot ha-kenanim ve-huhzaq hashem hazeh bekol zera yisrael leolam. Ve-zehu ha-taam be-Yosef she-amar ivri anokhi, velo sheyahziqu be-kenani</I>." </P>
<P>It is noteworthy that the principled conduct of the <I>meyaldot ha-ivriyot</I> is depicted as a manifestation of "<I>yirat Hashem</I>" (Shemot 1:17, 21, and Onkeles), the ideal standard of which was established by none other than <I>Avraham ha-ivri</I> in the context of the akedah (Ber. 22:12 ), and in the episode with Avimelekh (Ber. 20:11). [The link between the "<I>ivri</I>" theme and <I>yirat Hashem</I> is evident with respect to Yonah, as well (Yonah 1:9): "<I>Vayomer aleihem ivri anokhi ve-et Hashem elokei ha-shamayim ani yarei...</I>"] The capacity of the <I>meyaldot</I> to reinforce the quality of "<I>ivri</I>" in the framework of "<I>benei yisrael</I>" established the "<I>meyaldot ha-ivriyot</I>" as the ideal foundation for future Jewish leadership in the form of <I>keter kehunah</I>, <I>leviyah</I> and <I>keter</I> <I>malkhut</I>- "<I>va-yaas la-hem batim</I>" (Sotah 11b). </P>
<P>The quality of "<I>ivri</I>" is reflected particularly in the early life of Moshe Rabbeinu, the penultimate Jewish leader. As an infant, he is already identified by Paaroh's daughter by this designation (Shemot 2:6-7)- "<I>va-tomer mi-yaldei ha-ivrim zeh</I>". The commentators ask how she was able to determine his background, particularly according to the view that the decree was extended to all male children in the realm. Alternatively, if the law was limited to Jewish males, what is significant about her proclamation? It is possible, however, that it was her recognition of Moshe's innate "<I>ivri</I>" capacity that is meaningful according to both perspectives. <I>Hazal</I> suggest that she discerned Moshe's special status by the fact that the infant was unwilling to nurse from a non-Jewish source, reflecting an innate commitment to Jewish uniqueness. According to some <I>mefarshim</I>, it is also possible that she identified his origins through the <I>tevah</I> in which he was placed, the design of which reflected the qualities of the "<I>ivrim</I>". <I>Hazal</I> explain that the <I>tevah</I> was constructed to insulate Moshe from the harsh realities and influences of the external environment and in a way that reflected special sensitivity to his personal spiritual needs. The contrast to <I>tevat</I> Noah, whose primary purpose was merely survival, is especially noteworthy. Thus, the Torah emphasizes "<I>va-tahmera ba-hemer u-ba-zefet</I>". <I>Hazal</I> interpret that the <I>zefet</I> was on the outside in this <I>tevah</I> "<I>kedai shelo yariah oto zadik reiah ra shel zefet</I>". </P>
<P>"<I>Vayigdal Moshe vayeze el ehav vayare ish mizri makeh ish ivri me-ehav</I>"(2:11). The young Moshe discovers his own link to the Jewish people when his "<I>ivri</I>" perspective is triggered by two incidents in which the fates of individual Jews are put in jeopardy in a hostile environment. His response to the first crisis follows an awareness that Jews have no other recourse but their commitment and loyalty to each other (see Seforno's comment on "<I>ivri")- "vayifen koh va-khoh vayare ki ein ish</I>". In the second occurrence-" <I>ve-hineh shenei anashim ivrim nizim</I>"-, Moshe is shocked that two "<I>ivrim</I>" could interact in such a manner. According to some interpretations, his conclusion -"<I>akhen noda hadavar</I>"- constitutes a begrudging acknowledgement that the "<I>ivri</I>" component, latent in every Jew, is, alas, not always manifest. This recognition is to play an important role in Moshe's approach to his future leadership challenge. </P>
<P>Upon encountering Hashem, Moshe inquires about Hashem's nature and also queries how he should represent Hashem to the nation: "<I>ve-amru li mah shemo...mah omar aleihem</I>"(3:13). Rashi cites <I>Hazal's</I> comment that Hashem emphasized that specifically his quality of empathy (3:14)- "<I>imam anokhi be-zarah</I>" and not a theological statement should form the basis for the renewed relationship with the nation. Moreover, He instructed that Moshe introduce the request to Paaroh by invoking the "<I>ivri</I>" theme (3:18): "<I>va-amartem eilav Hashem elokei ha-ivriiyim niqrah aleinu...</I>" In fact, Moshe and Aharon initially took a different route(5:1<I>):" vayomru el Paaroh koh amar Hashem elokei yisrael shalah et ami.</I>" Indeed, this reference to "<I>elokei yisrael</I>" proved ineffective, as Paaroh immediately responded by dismissing this perspective: "<I>Vayomer Paaroh mi Hashem asher eshma be-kolo leshalah et yisrael; lo yadati et Hashem ve-gam et yisrael lo ashaleiah.</I>" Upon hearing the reformulated demand invoking the initial ivri theme (5:3)"<I>va-yomru elokei ha-ivrim niqra aleinu</I>"-, Paaroh was forced to adopt different tactics in his struggle with <I>benei yisrael</I>. Paaroh's memorable encounter with the "<I>meyaldot ha-ivriyot</I>" and perhaps the reports of Moshe's response to the fate of his fellow "<I>ivrim</I>" ("<I>akhen noda ha-davar</I>") precluded him from simply ignoring this theme. </P>
<P>The names "<I>yisrael</I>" and "<I>benei yisrael</I>" dominate Biblical and post- Biblical Jewish history. Yet, precisely in the formative stages of the development of and as "<I>yisrael</I>" it was critical to reassert the roots of the nation which could be traced to the unyielding idealism of Avraham <I>ha-ivri</I>, as manifest in the conduct of the <I>meyaldot</I> and in the persona of Moshe Rabbenu. </P>

<P>One of the central episodes in <I>Parshat Vayishlah</I> is the story of Dinah's ordeal and the subsequent attack against the family of Schechem by Shimon and Levi that it engendered. The Torah records Yaakov's unequivocal displeasure with the radical solution they promulgated. While they defended their actions with principled conviction(34:7,)- "<I>ki nevalah asah be-yisrael...ve-khen lo yeiaseh</I>", arguing that justice and family honor more than justified their behavior, it appears at first glance that Yaakov's harsh critique(34:30)- " <I>akhartem oti le-havisheini be-yoshev ha-aretz...va-ani metei mispar ve-neasfu alai ve-hikuni ve-nishmadeti ani ubeiti</I>" is rooted primarily in a sense of vulnerability and fear of isolation, purely pragmatic considerations. Shimon and Levi's succinct, yet powerful rejoinder (34:31)- "<I>vayomru ha-kezonah yaaseh et ahoteinu</I>"- suggests that they dismissed Yaakov's objections precisely on the grounds that a commitment to lofty principle justified even jeapordizing the security of the fledgling <I>Klal Yisrael</I>. </P>
<P>However, their interpretation of Yaakov's motivation in this matter appears to be untenable. Yakkov's use of sharp language such as "<I>akhartem oti</I>" and "<I>lehavisheini</I>", which according to a group of commentators (see, for example, Rashi, Seforno) implies an accusation that the brothers were guilty of compromising Yaakov's values and of tarnishing the idealistic image of <I>Klal Yisrael</I>, belies a purely pragmatic orientation. It is noteworthy that the passage of time did not dull the severity of Yaakov's condemnation of their actions notwithstanding the fact that the pragmatic consequences he feared never really materialized. Yaakov's entrenched disappointment in his two sons is reflected in the harsh words he directs to them in his final communication in the context of his parting prophecy to all the <I>shevatim</I> in <I>Parshat Vayechi</I> (49:5-7). The tenor and timing of his final evaluation reflects a profound and idealistic rejection of their values, as reflected primarily in the Shechem incident. Moreover, it is simply inconceivable that Yaakov Avinu, whose unique and ambitious blend of qualities (<I>tiferet</I>) qualified him as the <I>bechir ha-avot</I> and father of the <I>shevatim</I> would compromise idealistic values for the sake of security and condemn those who were willing to sacrifice for justice and loyalty. It was precisely Yaakov's courage and integrity in confronting and overcoming various formidable obstacles, including <I>saro shel eisav</I>, that earned him the title "<I>Yisrael</I>". How, then, are we to comprehend the debate between Yaakov and his two sons. Our understanding of the issues depends, in part, on the distinctive perspectives of the Rambam and Ramban. </P>
<P>According to the Ramban's analysis of this episode, Yaakov condemned the conduct of Shimon and Levi because it contRavened the <I>halachic</I> norm. Ramban (34:13) argues that the obligation of "<I>dinim</I>", one of the seven Noachide laws whose neglect warrants the death penalty (Sanhedrin 56b), constitutes an obligation to establish a comprehensive system of civil law that parallels our own system of <I>Choshen Mishpat</I>. Ramban concludes that neglecting to prosecute individuals who violate the law, such as Shechem, does not constitute a sufficient violation of this comprehensive obligation to justify administering the death penalty. While Shechem and his cohorts had violated Dinah and compromised the dignity of Yaakov's family, the brothers response was not <I>halachically</I> justified. According to this perspective, Yaakov's outrage stemmed from his dedication to <I>halachic</I> principle even in the face of personal humiliation. </P>
<P>Rambam (hil. Melakhim 9:14) limits the Noachide duty of "<I>dinim</I>" to the prosecution of other Noahide offenses. He, thus, concludes that the citizens of Schechem who refused to take action against Schechem were <I>halachically</I> liable to the punishment of death, as Shimon and Levi insisted. Ramban challenges this view precisely because Yaakov's condemnation of his sons' initiative is puzzling if they were compliant with the <I>halachic</I> norm. Yaakov had previously proved himself to be fearless in pursuing his <I>halachic</I>-spiritual obligations. Even if he was personally reticent, why would he castigate his children who were admirably implementing Divine law? Indeed, some of the commentators have struggled to justify Yaakov's stance according to Rambam's scheme (see, for example, Radvaz, ad loc.). </P>
<P>A close reading of the <I>pesukim</I> in both <I>Vayishlah</I> and <I>Vayechi</I> may reveal several clues regarding Yaakov's position. The Torah contrasts the initial reactions of Yaakov and his sons. When Yaakov first confronts the highly disturbing evidence <I>("ki timei et Dinah bito</I>"), we are told that he responds with silence(34:5)-"<I>ve-Yaakov shama...vi-heherish Yaakov ad boam</I>". Given his sense of outrage and of personal violation, his suppression of any external expression of anger or emotion undoubtedly reflects the attribute of "<I>gevurah</I>" (<I>kovesh et yizro</I>). As a matter of principle, Yaakov felt compelled to consult with the <I>shevatim</I> and to consider the long term implications of any action that might affect the destiny of <I>Klal Yisrael</I>, as well as the potential consequences for the reputation of <I>Klal Yisrael</I> and the system of halakhic values it embodies (<I>chillul Hashem</I>). His sons, on the other hand, react immediately, viscerally, and reflexively(34:7)- "<I>u-benei yisrael bau min ha-sadeh ke-shamam, vayitazvu ha-anashim, vayihar lahem meod</I>". It is interesting that Yaakov relates initially to Dinah as the personal victim of this crime and is still able to put the long range interests of <I>Klal Yisrael</I> ahead of personal or family considerations, while his children first perceive the matter in terms of its impact upon "<I>bat Yaakov</I>" and ("<I>nevalah asah be) yisrael</I>", and yet are unable to assimilate the broader potential implications of their actions! Later, when they, too, shift their focus to the personal aspect of this violation (34:14, 25,,27, 31), they are completely oblivious to the broader issues. Yaakov's condemnation of Shimon and Levi projected that the security and reputation of <I>Klal Yisrael</I> are not merely pragmatic matters, but themselves constitute significant values and ideals. The fact that the brothers acted on a matter of such gRavity without more serious deliberation, and without even consulting Yaakov, their father and the ideal mentor of <I>Klal Yisrael</I>, presents a striking contrast with Yaakov's own reticence to even respond "<I>ad boam</I>". The implications of this breach of authority and hierarchy was disturbing, indeed. </P>
<P>Furthermore, the Torah emphasizes that the brothers used the device of "<I>mirmah</I>"(trickery) (34:14), even as Schechem was depicting <I>Klal Yisrael</I> as "<I>sheleimim hem itanu</I>" (34:21), which Rashi and Ramban interpret as a reference to sincerity and magnanimity. According to some commentators, it is this duplicitous methodology that Yaakov refers to when he charges the brothers of having sullied his (and by extension, <I>Klal Yisrael's</I>) reputation for idealism (<I>akhartem oti</I>), generating a <I>chillul Hashem</I> (<I>le-havisheini</I>) whose impact might endure far beyond this particular episode. [Ramban in Vayehi (49:5-6) also notes that <I>chillul Hashem</I> motivated Yaakov's critique.] The ironic fact that <I>brit milah</I>, the unique symbol of <I>Klal Yisrael's</I> special devotion, commitment and sanctity, and the obligation introduced initially to distinguish the Noachide and Israelite codes is the duplicitous mechanism that was used to avenge for the Noachide breach may also have contributed to Yaakov's ire. </P>
<P>Yaakov <I>Avinu</I> rejected Shimon's and Levi's brand of idealism, notwithstanding their sincerity and piety, because he believed that principle had to be pursued with a broader vision, through principled methods, and in a more idealistic manner. Yaakov, according to Rambam's scheme, projects the principle that <I>halachic</I> conformity alone is not always sufficient to justify radical conduct when other <I>halachic</I> principles and values are at risk. [Compare Ramban, beg. of Kedoshim's view <I>of naval be-reshut ha-Torah.</I>] In his final remarks to Shimon and Levi in <I>Vayehi</I>, Yaakov precisely emphasizes his rejection of immediate violent solutions- "<I>Shimon ve-Levi ahim kelei hamas mekheiroteihem</I>" and distances himself from the approach of secrets and plots ("<I>besodam al tavo nafshi</I>"). He refers obliquely (Rashi- 49:5) to the fact that Shimon and Levi's Shechem methodology ultimately led also to the misguided persecution of Yosef <I>ha-Zaddik</I>. It was necessary to channel the concentrated, narrow idealism of Shimon and Levi in a more constructive direction by diffusing it throughout the nation ("<I>ahalkeim be-Yaakov ve-afizeim be-yisrael</I>") so that it could contribute in a more balanced framework. Yaakov's wisdom and balance reflected by his ability to apply a principled approach even to the pragmatic world earned him the name and special stature of Yisrael- "<I>ki sarita im elokim ve-im anashim va-tukhal". </P></I>

<P>Perhaps the most difficult challenge we face as parents and educators is how 
to effectively transmit Torah values and ethics. The Torah ascribes greatness to 
Avraham Avinu because of his ability to communicate these moral teachings. 
"<I>Ki yedativ lemaan asher yetzaveh es banav, ve'es bisso achaRav veshamru 
derech Hashem laasos tzedakah umishpat," (Bereishis</I> 18:19).</P>
<P>Accordingly, the Ran (Derashot HaRan, <I>derashah </I>5) explains Avraham's 
insistance that the wife of Yitzchak be chosen from Charan rather than from 
Canaan. Avraham's rejection of Canaan was not predicated upon their idolatrous 
practices, for his extended family in Charan served idols as well. Rather, as 
the Ran explains, Avraham's objection to the <I>Canaanim</I> was based on his 
familiarity with their flawed moral character. As difficult as it is to 
disseminate Torah knowledge, molding and developing a Torah personality is an 
even more formidable challenge. Hence, the prime concern of Avraham Avinu was 
that his daughter-in-law embody ethical and moral excellence.</P>
<P>The Kil Yakar emphasizes the need to create an encompassing environment 
conducive to Torah life. Citing the pasuk, "<I>Asher lo tikach ishah livni 
mibnos hacanaani asher anochi yoshev bekirbo,</I>" (Bereishis 24:3). The Kli 
Yakar questions Avraham's need to stress "<I>asher anochi yoshev bekirbo</I>," 
-among whom I dwell. The Kli Yakar explains that Avraham's concern was the 
potentially negative impact of an improper environment. Were Yitzchak's wife to 
be chosen from Canaan, the very place where she would continue to live 
throughout her married life, she would constantly be subjected to the pressures 
and influences of her youth. Avraham therefore insisted that her family not live 
in Canaan.</P>
<P>Yet, how can we cultivate and nurture this sense of ethics and morality so 
vital to effective <I>chinuch</I>? The Gemora explains (Sotah 3a) that "R'Chaim, 
son of R'Chaninah further said: What is the meaning of the verse 'You should 
walk after the Lord your God'? Is it possible for a human being to walk after 
the <I>shechinah</I>? </P>
<P>Has it not been said, 'For the Lord your God is a devouring fire'? Rather, 
the meaning is to follow the attributes of Hashem ..the Holy One Blessed be He 
visited the sick, as it is said, 'And Hashem appeared to him at Elonei Mamreh.' 
So shall you visit the sick."</P>
<P>Unlike most <I>mitzvos</I>, which are generally conveyed through imperatives 
and instruction, moral and ethical tenets are taught by example. Instead of 
commanding us directly to visit the sick and comfort those who mourn, the Torah 
records how Hashem performs such deeds and implores His people to do the same - 
<I>acharei Hashem elokeichem teileichu<U>.</P></I></U>
<P>Our mandate <I>v'halachta bidrachav</I> - to follow in His ways - requires of 
each of us to convey and transmit the substance and beauty of Torah in a similar 
way - to teach and impart Torah values by example, not merely through 
instruction.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[The <I>Tochacha</I>: A Foundation of Personal and Communal Responsibility]]></title>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: kitavo]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<P>Each member of <I>Kenesses Yisroel</I> is endowed with an inherent <I>Kedusha</I> which manifests itself both individually and collectively. A true <I>oveid</I> Hashem not only strives for personal piety and religious growth, but also concerns himself and identifies with the aims and needs of others.</P>
<P>The Torah ascribes added significance to a <I>mitzva</I> by virtue of its collective nature. Hence, should an individual loose a close relative during a festival his personal obligation to mourn is suspended until the conclusion of that festival in order to allow him to allow him to fulfill the obligation of <I>simcha</I> (rejoicing) during that <I>yom tov</I>. In explaining the priority given to that <I>simcha</I>, the Talmud (Moed Kattan 14b) states: "<I>Asi ase d'Ravm v'dachy ase d'yachid</I>" ("a positive collective commandment comes and pushes aside a positive individual commandment"). The Rambam maintains that both of these obligations, mourning the loss of a relative and rejoicing on a festival are biblical commandments. Hence, even from a biblical perspective, preference is shown to a collective obligation. Furthermore, basing themselves on an incident involving Rav Eliezer freeing a slave in order to insure <I>tefillah b'tsibur</I>, Tosafos asserts that even a collective Ravnical obligation can override a personal biblical prohibition.</P>
<P>The distinction between individual and collective obligations is often evident in the Torah's formulation of the commandment itself. Whereas individual commandments are often stated in the plural, collective imperatives are formulated in the singular, thus emphasizing the collectivity as a whole. An example of the latter is the obligation of counting the <I>Yovel</I> (Jubilee) cycle. Unlike the <I>mitzva</I> of taking a <I>lulav</I> on Succos which is formulated in the plural, "<I>u'l'kachtem lachem</I>" (Vayikra 23:40) ("and you shall take for yourselves"), here the Torah states, "<I>u'safarta l'cha</I>" (Vayikra 25:8) ("and you shall count for yourself"). For this reason, the Sifrei (ibid) comments, " '<I>u'safarta l'cha'</I> - <I>b'beis din</I>" (" 'and you shall count for yourself' - in a Ravnical court"), limiting the obligation of counting the Yovel years to the highest court which represents the people of Israel as a whole.</P>
<P>Another example is the obligation of counting the <I>omer</I> which, although initially rendered in the plural, "<I>u'safartem lachem</I>" (Vayikra 23:15) ("and you shall count for yourselves"), is later repeated in the singular "<I>tispar lach</I>" (Devarim 16:9) ("count for yourself"). Accordingly, the Torah requires each individual to count the omer, thereby accounting for the initial plural formulation of this commandment. However, basing himself on the second singular formulation, Rav Eliezer argues (Menachos 65b) that the counting must be <I>t'luya b'bais din</I>, dependent on the highest court as well. Hence, this court, the collective representative of Israel, must determine when the counting begins. The Sifre (Devarim 16:9) requires that the omer be counted twice, once individually and a second time collectively, by the highest court.</P>
<P>A further example of a Parsha which contains individual as well as collective elements is the <I>tochacha</I>, the portion of this week's Torah reading which discusses divine retribution. The <I>Tochacha</I>, like the commandment to count the <I>omer</I>, is found twice in the Torah. In Vayikra (26), it is formulated in the plural, addressing each individual member of <I>B'nei Yisroel</I>. In Devarim (28), however, it is repeated in the singular, which the Gaon of Vilna explains is directed to the collective unit of <I>Kenesses Yisroel</I>. The collective quality of this <I>tochacha</I> is emphasized by the verses (Devarim 29:13-14) which follow it:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>"<I>v'lo itchem l'vadchem anochi kores es habris hazos v'es ha'alah hazos, ki es asher yeshno po imanu omeid hayom lifnei Hashem Elokeinu v'es asher ainenu po imanu hayom</I>" ("not only with you do I make this covenant and oath; but with him that stands here with us this day before the Lord our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day").</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
<P>Rashi explains that the phrase "<I>v'lo itchem l'vadchem</I>" includes even "doros ho'asidim l'hiyos" - generations that are destined to yet come into existence. Thus, the collective nature of the tochacha in particular, and <I>Kenesses Yisroel</I> in general, includes any future member of <I>B'nei Yisroel</I> as well. Accordingly, the Gemora in Sotah(16b) and Sanhedrin(43b) derives the concept of <I>arvus</I>, communal responsibility, from the tochacha, which emphasizes the collective unit of <I>B'nei Yisroel</I>. In this sense, Rav Yeruchum Perlow (Sefer HaMitzvos L'Rasag, Chapter 57) explains the view of the Bahag who counts the <I>tochacha</I> and its blessings and curses among the 613 mitzvos. He suggests that he Bahag was not referring to the ceremony and ritual of the <I>tochacha</I>, but rather to the <I>mitzva</I> of <I>arvus</I> which is rooted in the <I>tochacha</I> itself.</P>
<P>The reading of the <I>tochachca</I> this Shabbos is not coincidental, but rather a <I>Takanas</I> (enactment of) Ezra requiring that the <I>tochacha</I> be read before Rosh Hashana. We must approach Rosh Hashana and the <I>yemei hadin</I> (days of judgement) with a heightened appreciation and awareness of the uniqueness of <I>arvus</I> and <I>Kedushas Yisroel</I>. May the reading of the <I>tochacha</I> realize our fervent <I>tefilos</I>, "<I>she tichle hashana u'klaloseha</I>" (the year and its curses come to an end).</P>

<P>In this week's <I>parshah</I> we see that Yaakov was very concerned about leaving <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>. Hashem appears to him and tells him not to worry. He Himself would go down to Egypt with him, and would return the Jewish people to Eretz Yisroel at the proper time. Hashem's gdescending into <I>galus</I> is with <I>klal yisroel </I>is known as "<I>galus haschechina</I>".</P>
<P>This concept of "<I>galus hachechina</I>" has been understood in the classic literature on several different levels: </P>
<P>Firstly, the Torah tells us that when someone kills accidentally, he must run away to stay in one of "the cities of refuge". But it is not necessary that he <U>suffer</U> there. Quite the contrary. The Torah says, "he should live there" (until the death of the high priest.) The connotation of that phrase is that the murderer should have a pleasant stay there. It is for this reason that the Ravs of the Talmud commented that if the murderer is one who enjoys learning Torah, we must provide him with a <I>shiur</I>. His Rav must also visit the "city of refuge" to present Torah lectures for the enjoyment of the murderer. The punishment of going into <I>galus</I> is bad enough, and should not be made worse by having him miss his regular Torah studies.</P>
<P>Similarly, when Hashem punishes the Jewish people and sends them into <I>galus</I> He personally accompanies us into that <I>galus</I> so that we will not suffer more than is necessary, and so that our stay will not be too terrible.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Talmud recalls instances when the Ravs had to place a <I>cherem</I> on a Torah scholar (for having violated sins), and would simultaneously put themselves into <I>cherem</I>. This was in order to remind themselves to be "<I>mattir</I>" the <I>cherem</I> on the Talmid Chochom at the same time they would be "<I>mattir</I>" their own <I>cherem</I>.</P>
<P>So too, <I>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</I> goes into <I>galus</I> along with us, "suffering along with <I>Am Yisroel</I>" so to speak. He will certainly not be able to forget about redeeming us from <I>galus</I>, since He will need to redeem Himself from the <I>galus</I>.</P>
<P>In the Tanya, Kabbalistic sources are quoted where a totally different understanding of the term (<I>galus hasheschina</I>) is presented. When Hashem created the entire world <I>ex nihilo</I>, the basic and fundamental nature of all things was nothingness; that nothing else existed (outside of Him). Even when everything in the world <U>was</U> brought into existence, if not for the <U>continuos</U> will of G-d that all these things <U>continue</U> to exist, everything would revert to the state of non-existence. (Ramban on Parshas Bereishis understands that this is the meaning of the phrase which is oft repeated,  "G-d saw that everything was good", i.e. He willed that everything should <U>continue</U> to exist). This continued will of G-d is referred to as "sparks of sanctity" (<I>nitzotzos of kedusha</I>). These "sparks of sanctity" preserve <U>all</U> things that continue to exist in the world - holy (people and objects), secular, and profane alike. In this sense there is a <I>galus hashechina</I>, because these "sparks of holiness" are "arrested" (so to speak) in unholy things, places, and people. One can truly refer to this state as one of "<I>melech assur borehotim</I>" (as if the King is imprisoned). Everything in the world yearns (so to speak) to have a meaningful existence. This will only came about if and when each created item will serve to heighten the glory of Hashem; i.e., if it will be used in the performance of some <I>mitzvah</I> or another. This is the symbolic meaning of the Talmudic comment as to what positive result was accomplished by sending the Jews into <I>galus</I>? Many non-Jews converted to Judaism, i.e., more of the secular world became involved in the observance of <I>mitzvos</I>, and had thereby attained a meaningful existence.</P>

<P>The <I>Kerias yam suf</I>, receiving of the <I>man</I>, <I>shlav</I>, and<I> mayim</I> in the <I>midbar</I>, and <I>milchemes amalek</I>, are all found in <I>Parshas Beshalach</I>. These incidents occur within the span of a few weeks- but are they related to one another merely by their chronological proximity, or is the Torah trying to teach us a deeper message by juxtaposing these three incidents?</P>
<P>The <I>Kerias yam suf</I>, the epitome of a <I>nes nigleh</I> - a revealed miracle, was the culmination of the miraculous events surrounding <I>yetzias mitzrayim. </I>The Torah addressed the two reactions people might have to such an event. </P>
<P>Most people who experience an open miracle recognize it as being the hand of <I>Hashem</I> but there are always some who are skeptical. How could <I>Amalek</I> attack the Jewish people so soon after <I>krias yam suf</I>? Did <I>Amalek</I> not realize they were trying to destroy a nation that had open miracles performed for them? <I>Amalek</I> closed their eyes to the miraculous events of <I>yetzias mitzrayim</I> by explaining them away as mere natural occurrences. <I>Amalek</I> is described in <I>Parshas Ki Teisei</I> as the nation, "<I>Asher karcha baderech</I>" - their entire philosophy was that everything was a <I>mikreh</I> - a coincidental happening. If one views everything as a coincidence even <I>krias yam suf</I> can be explained away as a bizarre natural even that happened to take place at the right time. If one chooses to deny the obvious hand of <I>Hashem</I> one can deny every miracle by calling it nature.</P>
<P>There is another possible reaction to a miracle. One acknowledges the miracle as being the work of <I>Hashem</I> but views the event as a one-time demonstration of the involvement of <I>Hashem</I> in this world. The <I>Ramban</I> in <I>Parshas Bo</I> explains that the ultimate purpose of a revealed miracle is to enable people to realize that they are surrounded by miracles every day. What the world calls nature is also a miracle. <I>Chazal</I> teach us that to recite <I>Hallel</I> daily is inappropriate whereas to say <I>Ashrei</I> everyday is praiseworthy. The <I>Meshech Chochma</I> explains that the theme of <I>Hallel</I> is praising <I>Hashem</I> for revealed miraculous events. <I>Ashrei</I>, which says, "poseach es yodecha umasbea l'chol chai ratson" ("you [God] open up your hands and satisfy all living creature's needs") is the ultimate praise for <I>parnasa</I>. <I>Hashem</I> takes care of our daily needs through seemingly natural ways. <I>Ashrei</I> teaches us to recognize <I>Hashem</I> even in the "natural" miracles that surround us daily. One who says <I>Hallel</I> daily but neglects the everyday saying of <I>Ashrei</I> demonstrates that he only recognizes <I>Hashem</I>'s "extraordinary" miracles but fails to see the miracles of everyday life.</P>
<P>To combat this reaction to miracles, the story of <I>krias yam suf</I>  is immediately followed by the events of the <I>slav</I>, <I>man</I>, and the finding of water in the desert. <I>Hashem,</I> who performs great miracles, also provides for our daily needs such as food and water. We are required to elevate the world by always seeing our attainment of <I>parnasa, </I>and the natural world in general as miraculous. </P>

<P>The mission of the spies sent to <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> was a simple one involving two tasks. Firstly, the spies were to observe different aspects of <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> including the geography, the agriculture, and the people. Upon returning, they were

 to report their observations. These seemingly simple assignments were not performed correctly and the results were catastrophic. Why were spies unable to observe correctly what they saw in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>?</P>

<P>During the forty days through which the spies tRaveled in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> they witnessed bizarre events. <I>Chazal</I> tell us that wherever they went they saw people burying their dead. The spies observed fruit which was so large that it could ba

rely be brought back with them. Each of these two events could have been interpreted in two opposite ways. From one perspective, the hand of Hashem could have been perceived clearly. Hashem had brought a plague throughout the land to divert the inhabitant

s' attention from the spies in their midst. The tremendous fruit could have been viewed as being representative of the overwhelming physical blessing <I>Eretz Yisroel </I>had been endowed with. Alternatively, these two observations could have been made an

d then interpreted in a completely different way. <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> could be seen as a land that is deadly (hence the wide spread funerals), and just as its fruits are abnormally large, so too must its inhabitants be too powerful for us. Logically, eit

her one of the aforementioned approaches could have been equally employed. That is, the events themselves were neutral, and it was the choice of the spies to interpret what they had seen in such a negative light.</P>

<P>Upon returning, the spies reported that they had appeared as grasshoppers in the eyes of the giants who lived in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>. The Torah relates the dual phrase the spies used to describe the feeling of inferiority. "We were like grasshopp

ers in our own eyes and we appeared as grasshoppers in their eyes"(<I>Bamidbar</I> 13:33). Their negative image of themselves was the source of their tragic mistake; they viewed themselves as "grasshoppers". If in their own eyes they were i

nferior they immediately projected that self image onto the perception others must have of them. A person who is pessimistic about himself will view the whole world as full of potential disasters. Rather than seeing the wonderful protection and blessing f

rom Hashem they saw in the people and the fruit a foreboding of horrible consequences if they would attempt to enter the land.</P>

<P>The downfall of the spies was their inability to observe correctly. <I>Parshas Shlach</I> concludes with the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>tzitzis</I>. The purpose of <I>tzitzis</I> is to teach us how to correctly interept what we see. <I>Tzitzis</I> instructs 
us not to follow the frailties of our hearts when we look at things; <I>tzitzis</I> tells us not to see things with incorrect preconceived notions. Rather, <I>tzitzis </I>teaches us to look at the world searching for the hand of <I>Hashem</I>. Looking at the string 

of blue on the <I>tzitzis</I>, which reminds us of the heavens above, we are instructed to look at the world around us as a blessing from <I>Hashem</I>. Let us constantly look at ourselves, others, and the entire world, in an optimistic light, searching 
to find all of the good that <I>Hashem</I> has given us. May <I>Hashem</I> bless us with the clear vision to find Him.</P>

<I><P>Galus Mitzrayim</I> serves as the prototype for all future exiles. This, the first <I>galus</I> of the Jewish people begins in <I>Parshas Vayigash</I>, as Yaakov and his family descend to <I>Mitzrayim</I>. The lessons we can glean from <I>galus Mitzrayim</I> will enable us to endure our present exile.</P>
<P>The Torah enumerates the descendants of Yaakov who arrived in <I>Mitzrayim</I>. Although the Torah presents the sum total as 70, only 69 people are recorded. This led <I>Chazal</I> to the conclusion that Yocheved, the mother of Moshe <I>Rabbeinu</I> was born at the same time as Yaakov's family entered the borders of <I>Mitzrayim</I>, marking the Jews' entry into <I>galus</I>. What is the divine message to be found in these simultaneous events? The birth of Yocheved represented the very beginning of the redemption from <I>Mitzrayim</I>. Hashem would not send us into <I>galus,</I> without ensuring from the very onset, that a <I>geulah</I> would take place. Although <I>yetzias Mitzrayim</I> was not to take place for many years, the seeds of the <I>geulah</I> had been planted at precisely the moment that <I>galus </I>had begun.</P>
<P>Anticipating  <I>geulah </I>at the onset of <I>galus</I> was taught by Yaakov. <I>Chazal</I> tell us that Yaakov brought cedar wood to <I>Mitzrayim</I> because he knew that eventually his descendants would be commanded to construct a <I>mishkan </I>from this material. Although the <I>mishkan</I> would only be built several generations later, Yaakov could not enter <I>galus</I> without carrying with him the seeds of <I>geulah.</I> This was not the first time that Yaakov had been exiled. He had already been forced to flee from <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> and had lived in Lavan's house for 20 years. Yaakov taught us that as a Jew goes into exile he must prepare the way for his return.</P>
<P>In <I>Parshas Vayigash</I> we learn another critical message concerning <I>galus. </I>Prior to Yaakov's arrival in <I>Mitzrayim</I> he had sent Yehudah ahead to prepare the way. <I>Chazal</I> tell us that Yehudah was instructed to establish a place of learning before Yaakov set foot in <I>Eretz Goshen</I>. Again, Yaakov was instructing us in how to go into <I>galus</I>. The only way to ensure the Jewish people's survival in <I>galus</I> is to immediately build places of learning. The slightest delay exposes the Jewish people to the dangers of <I>galus</I> without the Torah as protection. </P>
<P>The manner in which <I>galus </I> begins sets the tone for its duration. The Jewish people must go into <I>galus</I> knowing from the onset that they will return. They must carry the Torah with them from the very beginning to ensure their survival.</P>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>Now on this matter there is a warning in the scripture which says "Take heed in the plague of <I>tzara'as </I>... remember what the Lord thy God did unto Miriam by the way (Devarim 24:9). That is to say, consider what befell Miriam the prophetess who spoke against her brother, ... Now she did not speak despitefully of him but erred only in that she put him on a level with other prophets; nor was he resentful about all of these things, for it is said, "Now the man Moses was very meek" (Bamidbar 12:3). Nevertheless, she was forthwith punished with <I>tzara'as</I>. How much more then does this apply to wicked and foolish people who are profuse in speaking great and boastful things! ... </P>
<P>... Now the way of the company of the scornful and wicked is this: in the beginning they are profuse in words, as in the matter whereof it is said, "A fool's voice cometh through a multitude of words" (Koheles 5:2). Thence thy go on to speak to the discredit of the righteous, as in the manner whereof it is said, "Let the lying lips be dumb which speak arrogantly against the righteous" (Tehilim 31:19). Thence they become accustomed to speak against the prophets and to discredit their words, as in the manner whereof it is said, "Bu they mocked the messengers of God and despised his words and scoffed at his prophets (Divrei Hayamim 2, 36:16); moreover it is said, "They have set their mouth against heaven and their tongue walketh through the earth" (Tehilim 73:9). What brought it to pass that they set their mouth against Heaven? Their tongue, which first walked through the earth.</P>
<P>Such is the conversation of the wicked, occasioned by their idling at street corners, in the gatherings of the ignorant, and in the feastings of drunkards. But the conversation of the worthy ones in Israel is none other than the words of Torah and wisdom; therefore the Holy One, blessed is he, aids them and bestows wisdom upon them, as it is said, "And they that feared the Lord spoke together every man to his neighbor, and the Lord hearkened and heard. And a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon His name" (Malachi 3:17). (1)</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
<P>The foregoing passage from Rambam's <I>Mishnah Torah</I> is remarkable in many respects - e.g., the analysis of Miriam's error, the symbiotic coupling of Torah and <I>chochmah</I>, and the description of the inexorable progression from <I>lashon hara</I> to heresy. While each of these is obviously worthy of exposition, the constraints of the present forum do not allow for such a lengthy presentation. Let us, therefore, content ourselves by briefly commenting on the theme of progression (2). </P>
<P>The sequence depicted by the Rambam is sobering. The process begins with constant, frivolous, futile chatter - admittedly religiously unworthy conduct, but seemingly not <U>so</U> terrible - and culminates in heresy! How does such an insidious process unfold?</P>
<P>The answer is rooted in a fundamental religious-psychological principle. What a person does or how a person speaks is doubly important. First of all, the action or speech per se is important. <I>Mitzvos</I> are intrinsically meaningful and meritorious; <I>issurim</I> are intrinsically inimical and evil. Moreover, ones actions and speech also impact upon oneself. Through one's actions and speech one fosters attitudes and inculcates character traits, thereby forming one's personality and influencing future behavior.</P>
<P>Case in point: constant idle chatter is not simply a self-contained waste of time. Such mindless prattle lowers a person, making him petty and hungry for gossip. When he habitually indulges these inclinations, he becomes cynical. This is the inevitable result of engaging in <I>lashon hara</I> whereby one focuses on the faults and negatives within a fellow Jew.</P>
<P>Every Jew abounds with <I>mitzvos</I> as a pomegranate with seeds (3). Speaking <I>lashon hara</I> bespeaks a cynical decision to focus on another Jew's faults, and ignore his virtues.</P>
<P>The insidious process continues to inexorably unfold. Initially, one's cynicism may manifest itself only vis-&agRave;-vis one's neighbors or acquaintances. Inevitably, however, the cynical attitude engulfs one's attitude towards <I>tzadikim</I> and prophets, and ultimately even Hashem. Cynicism is the antithesis of faith (4).</P>
<P>The Rambam's poignant description shatters the mythical line of defense which we oft-times present. "Just this once I will sleep late and not <I>daven</I> with a <I>minyan</I>", "It is not such a big deal if I skip the weekly <I>gemorah shiur</I> this Tuesday night" etc. Besides ignoring the fact that every moment is intrinsically invaluable, such rationalizations sre skewed because no action or inaction is self-contained. Skipping <I>minyan</I> or a <I>shiur</I> even once weakens our commitment and makes us even more prone to such lapses in the future.</P>
<P>Our actions and speech reverberate. Whatever we do or say must be calibrated accordingly.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
R' Yoshiya says: Do
not read the word as <I>"matzos"</I>
but rather as <I>"mitzvos"</I>.
Just as people do not allow the matzos to become leavened, so should
they not allow the commandments to become leavened. Rather if [the
opportunity to fulfill a commandment] comes to your hand, do it
immediately. (1)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The hermeneutical
method of "do not read" (<I>al tikrei</I>) is most
puzzling, even disquieting. <I>Chazal</I> are seemingly altering the
text, or, minimally, the vocalization. How is this possible? 
</P>

<P>Careful
consideration of the example cited above suggests one possible
approach (2). Let us reflect upon the <I>peshuto shel mikra</I>. The
<I>pasuk</I> mandates guarding the matzos, i.e., actively preventing
them from becoming leavened. This necessitates that the baking
process be carried out with zeal and alacrity. Any laxity or
procrastination could result in the baking of <I>chometz</I> rather
than matzo.</P>

<P>R' Yoshiya's
comment may thus be paraphrased and amplified as follows. The mode in
which matzo is baked is paradigmatic; all <I>mitzvos</I> should be
pursued with zeal and alacrity.</P>

<P>In other words, the
method of <I>al tikrei</I> simply makes explicit what is already
implicit in the simple traditional reading of the text. Viewed from
this perspective, the method of <I>al tikrei</I> actually provides
penetrating insight into the <I>peshuto shel mikra</I>. This insight
is corroborated by the homophonic kinship
between the simple reading and its <I>al tikerei</I> variant.</P>

<P>The <I>Gemora</I> in <I>Maseches Menachos</I> provides another illustration of the
method of <I>al tikrei</I> being applied in this manner.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
R' Meir used to say, a person is obligated to recite one hundred
blessings daily, as it is written "And now Yisroel what (<I>ma</I>)
does HaShem your God ask of you &#150; only to fear him (3).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The obvious difficulty is that the <I>pasuk </I>cited by R' Meir does not
seem to support his statement. Rashi <I>ad locum</I>
resolves this difficulty by suggesting that the word "what"
(<I>ma</I>) should be read as "hundred" (<I>me'ah),
</I>thus generating the declarative
statement "One hundred [blessings] HaShem your God asks of you".
In other words, R' Meir is applying the hermeneutical method of<I> al
tikrei</I>.</P>

<P>In
this instance the explanation proceeds as follows. The <I>pasuk</I>
cited by R' Meir is problematic. How can the Torah downplay <I>yiras
shomayim</I> and the difficulty
involved in its attainment by saying that HaShem asks only for this
one thing. Clearly then the Torah is instructing us that <I>yiras
shomayim</I> is something natural,
even instinctive. This is the thrust of the Rama's first gloss in
Shulchan Aruch. If only a person will be forever mindful of
<I>Hakadosh Barush Hu</I>, "immediately he will attain fear [of heaven]" (4).</P>

<P>The Torah hints at
this by characterizing <I>yiras shomayim</I> as something easily
attainable &#150; provided, of course, we do not allow ourselves to
be distracted from <I>"Shivisi Hashem L'negdi tamid" </I>("I
have placed God always before me"). (5)</P>

<P>How do we counter
our tendency to be distracted and forget that we are always in the
presence of HaShem? The Rambam explains that one method <I>Chazal </I>
employed was obligating us to recite many <I>berachos</I> "in
order that we should constantly remember HaShem" (6).</P>

<P>In other words, the
<I>pasuk</I> "And now Yisroel" hints to us that <I>yiras
shomayim</I> is natural and thus easily attained if only we will be
forever mindful of HaShem's presence. One way in which this
mindfulness is encouraged is by the recitation of myriad <I>berachos</I>
which <I>inter alia</I> encourages us to recognize the reflections of
His presence and handiwork in the natural world. And thus R' Meir's
<I>al tikrei</I> which proclaims the obligation to recite <I>berachos</I>
simply brings to the fore what is implicit in the <I>pasuk</I>. <I>Yiras
Shomayim</I> is easily attained and naturally experienced if only we
live mindfully, not mindlessly.</P>

<P>_________</P>

<P>1. Rashi to Shemos 12:17, quoting Mechilta</P>
<P>2. Careful study is required to determine if this approach is adequate for all examples of <I>al tikrei</I>.</P>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>R. Yitzchak said: [God] need not have begun the Torah but from "This month shall be for you" because it is the first commandment which Israel was commanded. What is the reason that [God] began with the book of Genesis? Because [He wished to convey the message of the verse] "The power of His acts He told to his people in order to give them the estate of nations." So that if the nations of the world will say to Israel "You are bandits" for you conquered the lands of the seven nations, Israel will say to them "The whole earth belongs to the Holy One Blessed be He. He created it and he gave it to the one found proper in his eyes. By his wish He gave it to them and by His wish He took it from them and gave it to us". (1)</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
<P>R. Yitzchak's comment highlights a most striking and jarring contrast. "Of all lands<I> Eretz Yisroel</I> alone is holy" (2); it is the choicest of lands.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>Rather [the verse means] that Hebron was fertile, with all that was good sevenfold, in comparison to Zoan. [The verse] comes to inform you of the excellence of the Land of Israel, for there is no more rocky terrain in the Land of Israel than Hebron. This is why they set it aside for tombs of the dead. And you have no superior to Egypt among all the lands...and Zoan is the best in the Land of Egypt...yet Hebron was better than it sevenfold. (3)</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
<I><P>Eretz Yisroel</I> is the focal point for divine providence. "A land that Hashem, your God, seeks out; the eyes of Hashem, your God, are always upon it...". (4)</P>
<P>On the other hand, the seven nations were abominable and loathsome. "When Hashem, your God, will cut down the nations ... beware for yourself lest you be attracted after them ... and lest you seek out their gods ... you shall not do so because ... for everything that is an abomination of Hashem, that He hates, have they done to their gods...". (5) "Do not follow the traditions of the nations that I expel from before you, for they did all of these and I was disgusted with them".(6) In fact, these nations were so thoroughly corrupt and singularly wicked that the Torah singles them out for eradication. "But from the cities of these peoples that Hashem, your God, gives you as an inheritance, you shall not allow any person to live". (7)</P>
<P>What are we to glean from the fact that <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> was originally given to the seven nations?</P>
<P>This jarring contrast was intended to foreshadow a fundamental historical pattern - indeed, a veritable law of history - and metaphysical truth. Sanctity arouses violent opposition. Ruminating in an ahistorical context one might have theorized that morally debased and religiously corrupt people would simply ignore sacred sites. Such sites lie beyond their ken and orbit of interests. However, this has never been the case. On the contrary, those people(s) who constitute and represent forces of evil and impurity are perversely drawn to holy sites. They seek to suppress sanctity by gaining sovereignty over such sacred places from those who would safeguard their sanctity. Thus, for example, Titus, from all of his conquests, singled out the conquest of Jerusalem to be celebrated by the construction of the Roman Arch of Triumph.</P>
<P>This historical pattern continues unabated in present times. Current Palestinian nationalism did not exist while East Jerusalem, including <I>Har ha-Bayis</I>, was occupied by Jordan. Palestinian nationalism is a response to <U>Jewish</U> sovereignty over these sacred sites.</P>
<P>The initial giving of <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> to the seven nations foreshadowed this historical pattern and metaphysical reality. Precisely because of its sanctity, <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> would arouse the forces of evil and become the focal point in the struggle between Good and Evil.</P>

<I><P>Chumash</I>, as mandated by the <I>mishna</I> in <I>Pirkei Avos </I> (<I>"ben chamesh lemikra</I>"), is the first course of study for Jewish children. The reason for this is that <I>chumash</I> is the basis for all subsequent study, and on its most basic, exoteric level can be grasped even by young children. Unfortunately, we erroneously conclude that the study of <I>chumash</I> , <I>rachmana letzlan</I>, is a simple, even simplistic endeavor. Accordingly, our study of <I>parshas ha-shavua </I> (<I>shnayim mikra veechad targum) </I> is ofttimes swift and superficial. The inevitable result of our underestimation and neglect of <I>chumash</I> is that we fail to mine countless pearls of wisdom.</P>
<P>Consider the following case in point drawn from this week's <I>parsha</I>. The <I>pasuk</I>, "You will eat and you will be satisfied, and bless <I>Hashem</I>, your God, for the good Land that He gave you," is immediately recognized and subsequently dismissed as merely providing the source for the <I>mitzva d'oraisa</I> of <I>Bircas HaMazon. </I> While this superficial understanding is indubitably correct, it is also woefully inadequate. A careful, thoughtful study of the <I>pasuk </I>and its context, however, yields profound wisdom<I>. </P>
</I><P> The aforementioned <I>pasuk</I>, " You will eat, etc., "is itself highly suggestive. Having eaten and become satiated is surely an occasion for <I>bracha</I>, but why does that <I>bracha</I> focus on <I>Eretz Yisroel </I>? How is <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> relevant to the plentiful repast enjoyed elsewhere?</P>
<P>&#9;The context of the aforementioned <I>pasuk</I> is equally suggestive.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>For Hashem, your G-d, is bringing you to a good land ... a land of wheat, barely, grape, fig, and pomegranate; a land of oil-olives and date-honey; a land where you will eat bread without poverty ... you will eat and you will be satisfied, and bless Hashem, your G-d, for the good land that He gave you.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
<P>Why is the <I>mitzva</I> of <I>Birkas HaMazon</I> (Grace After Meals) framed by a glowing desciption of <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> and its bounty?</P>
<P>&#9;Towards the end of this week's <I>Parsha</I> the Torah again describes <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>, underscoring its uniqueness. "A land that Hashem, your G-d, seeks out". Ramban, citing the Sifrei, explains that Hakadosh Baruch Hu seeks out and blesses <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>; the rest of the world is sustained from the blessing bestowed upon and channeled through <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>. </P>
<P>In light of the above, the Torah's presentation of <I>Mitzvas Birkas Hamazon</I> shines brilliantly. When one has enjoyed Hashem's benefaction - eating to the point of satisfaction, he is required to thank Hashem for the singular gift of <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> in which merit he received and enjoyed this benefaction. Any <I>bracha</I> we enjoy anywhere in the world can be traced back to <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>, "a land of wheat, barely, etc." And thus when, "you will eat and you will be satisfied", it is incumbent upon you to "bless Hashem, your G-d, for the good land that He gave you".</P>
<P>Postscript: The doctrine of the centrality of <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> resonates especially powerfully and poignantly in our day. In addition to the profound existential empathy we should feel with our bretheren in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> who heroically safeguard <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> and suffer for the sake of <I>Kelal Yisroel</I>, we also need to realize that the crisis of these soul-trying times engulfs us all wherever we reside. "A land that Hashem, your G-d, seeks out"; as <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> goes, so go world Jewry and the entire world! [Editor's note: this postscript was written before Thursday's bombing tragedy in Jerusalem.]</P>

<P>The year 5761 is according to our calculations (1), is a <I>Shmitah</I> year. Although the prohibition of agricultural activity is limited to <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>, certain restrictions exist concerning the use of Israeli produce even if exported, so <I>Shmitah</I> is <I>halacha l'ma'aseh</I> for us as well. </P>
<P>In fact, some authorities prohibit all produce which is guarded or worked on in normal fashion by those who grow it (2). However, most authorities seem to reject this view (3). </P>
<P>Grains and vegetables which are both planted and harvested in <I>Shmitah</I> are prohibited (4). This applies to exported soup powders, canned vegetables, and cookies made of Israeli grain, including those on the shelf for up to 15 months after the end of <I>Shmitah</I> (4a). Some authorities permit them after similar products grow from the following year's crop but others disagree (5). When harvested after <I>Shmitah</I>, they are permitted when the next year's crop grows, or on Chanukah at the latest (5a). Fruits which blossom during <I>Shmitah</I>, as well as grains and vegetables which are harvested during <I>Shmitah</I>, are holy. They must be treated accordingly. In fact, they may not be exported, but if they are exported they may be eaten (6). They may not be thrown out unless they become inedible, nor may they be eaten by a non-Jew. Squeezing citrus fruits into juice is permissible (7). Peels and pits which are ordinarily thrown out have no <I>kedusha</I> and may be thrown out (8).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Method of Sale</P>
<I><P>Shmitah</I> fruit may not be marketed in normal fashion. This prohibition applies to the seller, and does not make the fruit forbidden. The buyer violates <I>lifnei iver</I> (causing someone else to sin) on two counts - the sale itself and the giving of the money to the seller. The later problem is due to the fact that money exchanged for <I>shmitah</I> products assumes the holiness of the produce. The money may only be used to buy food, and this assumes the holiness of the money, making the money <I>chullin</I>.</P>
<I><P>Lifnei iver</I> does not apply when the other party (the seller in this case) acts on the basis of a Ravninc ruling (that the land may be sold to a non-Jew and that the produce grown on a non-Jew's land is not holy). Even if the buyer does not abide by these rulings (which are controversial and will be discussed later), he may buy <I>shmitah</I> produce in regular fashion (9). Nevertheless, it is preferable to include the <I>shmitah</I> produce in a larger sale without specifying a price for the produce (10), or to buy the produce by check or on credit (11). One may not keep <I>Shmitah</I> fruit at home ("fruit" in this article, unless stated otherwise, refers to all produce) beyond the time they are no longer available in the field. If one keeps them beyond this time (called "<I>z'man biur</I>") they may no longer be eaten. Rather, one must render them ownerless (be "<I>mafkir</I>" them) and place them outside the home. The owner may then reclaim them and eat them as <I>Shmitah</I> fruit (12). Some maintain that the fruits no longer have the holiness of <I>Shmitah</I> fruit, or their restrictions (13).</P>
<P>If one is in doubt as to the time of <I>biur</I>, he must make the fruits <I>hefker</I> everyday until the "<I>z'man biur</I>" has definitely passed (14).</P>
<P>There is a way to eliminate the problem of <I>biur</I>, as well as the problem of selling <I>Shmitah</I> fruit, by setting up an <I>Otzar Beis Din</I>. This is a system whereby farmers give authority to a Ravnical court to tend to their fields. The court then appoints the farmers its agents to gather the produce. The court sets a price and the customers buy on credit or by check so that the money does not have the laws of <I>Shmitah</I>. The court then pays the farmers and storekeepers for their work (15).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Non-Jewish Produce</P>
<P>There is a great controversy about fruits grown by non-Jews on farms they own in Israel. While all agree that the prohibition against vegetables planted and harvested during <I>Shmitah</I> does not apply (16), the question is whether the produce has the holiness of <I>Shmitah</I> (17). Rav Yosef Karo held that it does not, and therefore must be tithed. He even excommunicated those who did not tithe. Although the majority of authorities differ with Rav Yosef Karo, the magnitude of his authority continues to determine the custom of Jerusalem. In other parts of Israel the custom is to treat the produce as <I>Shmitah</I> fruit, while tithing it in deference to Rav Yosef Karo's decision (18).</P>
<P>Some authorities hold a compromise view. The fruit must be eaten as <I>Shmitah</I> fruit, but the prohibition against marketing and the law of <I>biur</I> do not apply. Tithes need not be taken (19).</P>
<P>The ramifications of this controversy, which are great due to the large amount of Israeli land controlled by Arabs, especially since 1967, have been greatly extended. This is because of the Chief Ravnate's sale of most Jewish owned farms in Israel to Arabs for the duration of <I>Shmitah</I>. This practice, now over one hundred years old, was sanctioned as <I>horo'as sha'ah</I> (a temporary ruling) by many of the great Ravs of the late nineteenth century, including Rav Yitzchok Elchonon of Kovne, probably the most widely respected authority of his time (20).</P>
<P>This sale can allow Jews to work the land during <I>Shmitah</I>, but only if two assumptions are made: a) that the laws of <I>Shmitah</I> are no longer Torah law but only of Ravnic nature and b) that ownership of the land by non-Jews cancels this Ravnic sanctity (21). The laws of <I>Shmitah</I> would now be only Ravnic because the sanctity of Israel with respect to laws of the land is only <I>d'rabonon</I> --either since the destruction of the Second Temple, or even from its very inception. Incidentally, there is a view, rejected by most authorities, that <I>Shmitah</I> is not mandatory at all these days, since we have no <I>yovel</I>, the fiftieth Jubilee year, which applies only when most Jews live in Israel (22).</P>
<P>Since both of the above mentioned assumptions, especially the latter one, are very questionable, the Ravs did not allow a Jew to do work prohibited by the Torah - even after the sale. They further stipulated that the ruling is a temporary one, designed to prevent the collapse of the new settlements (23). Unfortunately, many farmers do not observe the above restrictions, and the sale has become a matter of course, even for settlements that could survive without it. Only the Agudas Israel settlements have consistently refused to rely on the sale, due largely to the ruling of the Chazon Ish.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Sale Forbidden</P>
<P>The Chazon Ish (24) forcefully rejected the second assumption above, and ruled that the sale was not effective to alter the state of the produce or to permit work on the land. In addition, he claimed that the sale violates the Torah injunction against selling the land to non-Jews , and rejected all the efforts to avoid this problem. These include a temporary sale, sale to a non-idol worshipper, sale of only trees and the immediately surrounding area, sale to a non-Jew who already owns land in Israel and sale to benefit the Jewish settlements (25). He further stated that since the sale was prohibited, it has no legal effect if done by proxy (e.g. the Ravnate) (26). Other authorities dispute the prohibition of the sale, and especially the contention that the sale is not valid (27). The lack of an official government bill of sale and/or real intent, which renders the sale invalid according to some authorities (28), does not preclude it according to others (29).</P>
<P>If the sale is valid, the Rav Yosef Karo's ruling becomes even more far-reaching, for even if the sale does not allow for the working of the fields, the produce does not have the laws and restrictions of <I>Shmitah</I>. This would seem to make grains and vegetables permissible - although some disagree (30) - and remove the question of worked or guarded fruit. If one rejects Rav Yosef Karo's ruling than even if the sale is effective to allow the farmers to work, the restrictions on the produce still apply.</P>
<P>Thus, for the American consumer, the main issue is not the effectiveness of the sale (once one assumes its validity), but rather the question of the status of the produce of non-Jews. With respect to fruit, even if one rejects Rav Yosef Karos; ruling and even the validity of the sale, most authorities permit the fruit to be eaten until "<I>z'man biur</I>" as <I>Shmitah</I> fruit, even if it is worked and guarded as usual (31).</P>
<P>This last fact is crucial not only to those who want to buy Israeli citrus fruit next winter but also to those who purchase an <I>esrog</I> grown in Israel. This is because an <I>esrog</I> must be edible <I>Halachikly</I> even if one does not plan to eat it. Rav Moshe Feinstein zt"l has ruled (32) leniently in this matter, while others disagree since many (some say most) authorities prohibit worked and/or guarded fruit (33). Some suggest that an <I>esrog</I> has no laws of <I>Shmitah</I> fruit, since it is grown for the mitzvah and not to be eaten (34). If one rejects this idea, then one may not throw out his <I>esrog</I> after <I>Sukkos</I>. It must be used as jelly (which must be eaten before the "<I>z'man biur</I>" which is in Shvat (35) ) or disposed of after it becomes inedible. Rav Yosef Karos; ruling does not apply because <I>esrog</I> growers do not sell their land through the Chief Ravnate. The seller's problem of marketing and perhaps even that of exporting is often avoided through the <I>Ozar Beis Din</I> system described above (36). The problem of the money assuming laws of <I>Shmitah</I> is best avoided by paying for the four "minim" together (37). (The status of the <I>lulav</I> and <I>haddasim</I>(38) is questionable, but many <I>lulavim</I> and <I>haddasim</I> sold in America are not Israeli.</P>
<P>Obviously, this is only a superficial summary of the laws of <I>Shmitah</I> as they apply to the consumer, for we learn in Tosofos (39) that there is no limit to the laws of restrictions which apply to <I>Shmitah</I> fruit. We all eagerly await the time when all of us will return to Israel and fully observe all the laws of <I>Shmitah</I>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ability of a husband to annul his wife's vows (Bamidbar 30:14) places a great responsibility upon him.  His silence is considered an agreement to the vow.  Therefore, he bears her iniquity, as if he had compelled her or duped her to sin (Sforno 30:15,16).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, all of Israel incurred Hashem's wrath when they did not protest against those who sinned with the moabite women, and especially Zimri who sinned openly.  Hashem's anger abated when they didn't protest when Pinchos killed Zimri either (Sforno 25:4,11).  Apparently, <I>Bnei Yisrael's</I> silence in the face of contradictory events indicates their apathy or timidity rather than their concurrence, and it sufficed to halt the plague.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even Moshe <I>Rabbeinu</I> delayed rebuking <I>Am Yisroel</I> until just before his death, fearing that it would be counterproductive.  Moreover, he began with indirect criticism out of respect (Rashi, Devarim 1:1,3).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These three lessons, gleaned from the three <I>parshiyos</I> read between <I>Shiv'a Asar B'Tamuz</I> and <I>Tish'a B'Av</I> (<I>Bein HaMetzarim</I> - the "three weeks"), highlight a perennial issue which has particular relevance as we mourn the <I>Churban</I>.  After all, Yerushalayim was destroyed because its citizens did not rebuke on another (Shabbos 119b).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Rabbonim</I> are required to protest even if the people may not accept the criticism.  Yet, if it is clear that a rebuke will be ignored, it is better that the people sin unintentionally (Shabbos 55a, see Tosafos).  Clearly, many judgement calls must be made, including, inevitably, mistakes in both directions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A prerequisite for bringing people closer to Torah is love (Avos 1:15).  This love, exhibited by disciples of Aharon <I>Hakohen</I> whose descendants bless us with love, must extend to all creatures (<I>b'riyos</I>), especially those who have strayed and require <I>kiruv</I>.  Indeed, <I>imitatio Dei</I> requires that we rebuke those whom we love, as Hashem does (Mishlei 3:12), out of concern for their welfare.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to succeed, this love must be mutual.  We are advised to love rebuke and the person who offers it.  The existence of <I>tochachah</I> in the world leads to blessing and the elimination of evil in the world (Tamid 28a, see Rosh).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a world full of evil, including the crisis in <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>, and at a time that the <I>Churban</I> is on our minds, we can help by offering and accepting appropriate <I>tochachah</I>, given and received with love.  The reversal of <I>Sin'as Chinom</I> and '<I>Lo Hochichu Ze Es Ze</I>' which caused the <I>Churban</I> will reverse the course of history and bring us the <I>Geula Shleima</I>.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">I</P>
<P>"May Hashem make you like Efraim and Menashe," and he put Efraim before Menashe (48:20). This classical <I>beracha</I> emphasizes Yaakov Avinu's reversal of the chronological order of birth of his grandsons when he blessed them. What does this incident represent?</P>
<P>Earlier (ibid, 14), Yaakov placed his right hand on Efraim's head, and his left hand on Menashe's. Yet Menashe remained on Yaakov's right knee, necessitating the crossing of Yaakov's hands. Why didn't Yaakov simply place Efraim on his right knee?</P>
<P>The Netziv (14) explains that Efraim preceded Menashe only in spiritual matters, symbolized by Yaakov's placing his right hand on Efraim's head. However, in wordly matters Menashe was superior, and was therefore blessed on Yaakov's right knee.</P>
<P>Indeed, the little we know about the lives of Efraim and Menashe supports the description of their respective strengths. Efraim was often in Yaakov's presence learning Torah (Rashi, 1), whereas Menashe served as the official interpreter in Yosef's palace (Rashi 42:43).</P>
<P>When Yaakov defended his actions, he told Yosef (48:19), "I know that the elder will be great, but the younger will be even greater". Rashi explains that this referred to the respective descendants of Menashe and Efraim, namely Gidon and Yehishua. The Netziv added that Gidon was a warrior, succeeding in worldly pursuits, whereas Yehoshua was primarily a Torah scholar and teacher, excelling in spiritual matters.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">II</P>
<P>A fundamental difference between the worldly and spiritual realms is reflected in these biblical personalities. To succeed in worldly affairs - diplomatic, military, technological, and financial - one must always respond to changing realities. Innovation is a prerequisite for overcoming new challenges in physical matters. New strategies, weapons, technologies, and careers are appropriate, and necessary, in order to succeed.</P>
<P>By contrast, spiritual accomplishment demands fealty to ancient tradition. Both in study and practice, the Torah Jew is guided by the law given by Hashem at Sinai thousands of years ago. Even novel interpretations are attempts to understand that revelation, and were initially given at Sinai.</P>
<P>Gidon overcame a more powerful army by devising a new strategy. In making a great noise by sounding <I>shofars</I> and breaking jugs, his small force fooled the enemy into flight and they were defeated (Shoftim 7:19-22). Wars must be fought with new weapons and strategies to confound the foe. This individual innovation was referred to as "this strength of yours" which Hashem gave Gidon to save <I>Am Yisroel</I>(6:14).</P>
<P>Yehoshua was the loyal disciple of Moshe, the one to whom Moshe transmitted the Torah he had received at Sinai. Moshe's face was like the sun, and Yehoshua's like the moon (Baba Basra, 75a). Yehoshua's goal was to reflect the radiance of his master Moshe, as the moon reflects the light of the sun. He was chosen for spiritual leadership because of his dedication to his <I>rebbe</I> and tradition, and his aversion to innovation in the study and practice of Torah.</P>
<P>These ideas resonate not only in the personalities of the great descendants of these shvatim, but in the very name of their forebears as well. The name Menashe is based on "nashani" (41:51), the root of which means to forget (Rashi 32:33), or to move away. In the worldly area in which Menashe excelled, one must forget old ideas and move to deal with new realities.</P>
<P>The name Efraim comes from "hifrani" (41:52), which means He has made me fruitful. Just as a fruit is a replica of the previous ones grown on that tree, so does spiritual greatness and leadership require preserving the immortal tradition of previous generations.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">III</P>
<P>The Medrash Tanchuma (Naso 29) states: A person should not say, "I will not fulfill Ravnic commandments, such as Ner Chanukah, since they are not in the Torah itself." In fact, Hashem agrees with these enactments. The proof is that Yaakov placed Efraim before Menashe, and Hashem confirmed this order by the fact that Efraim's offering preceded Menashe's.</P>
<P>The enigmatic connection between Ravnic mitzvos and the precedence of Efraim can be explained based on the above. <I>Klal Yisroel's</I> healthy aversion to new mitzvos might lead to the rejection of <I>Ner Chanukah</I>. Only if Hashem approves will the new commandment be followed.</P>
<P>Yaakov's reversal of the order was a bold and questionable spiritual decision, and yet Hashem confirmed it. Change for its own sake is objectionable, but when instituted by great leaders who normally abhor innovation, it must be embraced by <I>Am Yisroel</I>, just as it is endorsed by Hashem.</P>
<P>Unusual circumstances led Yaakov to bless Efraim first, and led Chazal to institute <I>Ner Chanukah</I>. But the connection is deeper. The very name Efraim requires loyalty to old tradition and resistance to spiritual change. Only one whose conservative bias to preserve ancient laws and customs is fully developed can be trusted to make the occasional change warranted by a new situation.</P>
<P>By placing Efraim first, Yaakov demonstrated not only the priority of spirituality, but also the need to adhere to the traditional Torah way, changing only when necessary. When Hashem confirmed the reordering, He provided guidelines for Halachic leadership and innovation for all generations, and the basis for the acceptance of <I>Ner Chanukah</I>. Hopefully, those loyal to Torah will find and follow Ravnic leaders who will strike the proper balance between tradition and innovation.</P>

<P>Yaakov Avinu's vow to give a tenth of his wealth to Hashem (28:20-22) is a model for all of us in times of crisis (Medrash Rabbah 70:1). The Rambam (<I>Taaniyos</I> 1:1) records a Torah commandment to pray and sound trumpets when the community faces a crisis. If the community recognizes that the difficult situation results from their misdeeds and do <I>teshuvah</I>, the crisis will be lifted. But, if they do not pray, and attribute their plight to chance, their troubles will increase. </P>
<P>The <I>mitzvah</I> of sounding trumpets applies in times of crisis, as well as in days of joy and festivals when offerings are brought (<I>Bamidbar</I> 10:9-10). The Magid Mishnah asks why the Rambam did not count the two seemingly unrelated instances when we are obligated to blow trumpets as two separate <I>mitzvos.</P></I>
<P>Perhaps Rambam's reason for the <I>mitzva </I>provides the answer.  The purpose of sounding the trumpets is to proclaim our belief in Hashem's providence. Just as we declare that crisis is not a chance event, but something decreed by Hashem, so too must we demonstrate our recognition that joy and festivals are blessings bestowed by Hashem. It is this common theme which is the essence of the single <I>mitzva </I>of the trumpets<I>. </P></I>
<P>A similar idea can explain the view of the Rambam concerning prayer. In the Sefer Hamitzvos (<I>Aseh </I>5) he states that the Torah commands us to pray in a time of crisis. The Rambam interprets "<I>mikra kodesh"</I> (<I>Vayikra</I> 23:2) as a communal <I>mitzva</I> to pray on holidays with joy and <I>hallel</I>. Prayer, like trumpets, in situations of extreme crisis and celebration reflects the realization that both are decreed by Hashem.</P>
<P>In America, <I>Am Yisroel</I> has been blessed with security and great prosperity. As the nation expresses thanksgiving, we certainly must thank Hashem for protecting and blessing us. Yet, America faces an unprecedented crisis of terrorism which threatens both our security and prosperity. For us, the terrorism in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> is a source of perennial concern. </P>
<P>In times of crisis we should give <I>tzedakah, </I>as Yaakov Avinu did, do <I>teshuvah</I> as the Rambam rules, and <I>daven</I> with greater intensity, as the Rambam states. <I>Uteshuvah, utefilla, utzedaka maavirin es roah hagezeira." </I> </P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: korach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The <I>Medrash</I> (<I>Bamidbar Rabbah</I> 18:2) understands the opening phrase of <I>Parshas Korach</I>, "Vayikach Korach" as not only to mean take or separate, but rather to persuade. </P>
<P>In <I>Bereishis</I> (2:15) where <I>Hashem</I> "takes" Adam and places him in <I>Gan Eden</I>, Rashi understands the He persusades Adam to enter the garden. Adam, a man who was created outside of <I>Gan Eden</I> resists change until <I>Hashem</I> convinces him. Similarly when Sarai "takes" Hagar as a wife for Avraham (<I>Bereishis</I> 16:3), Rashi again informs us that Sarai has convinced her maidservant, who was clearly afraid of becoming Avraham's wife, of the great privilege and opportunity that the position would afford. Finally, when <I>Avraham</I> "takes" Yishmael  (<I>Bereishis </I> 17:23) to be circumcised, the Ohr HaChaim understands the phrase to mean that Avraham<I> </I>convinced him to undergo the significant operation. In <I>Parshas Korach</I>, Korach also "takes", i.e. persuades, many individuals to rebel against the establishment and leadership of Moshe and Aaron.</P>
<P>What was it that Korach used to draw the 250, "Leaders of the Assembly, those summoned for meeting, men of renown?" The Gemora (<I>Sotah</I> 13b) commenting on the phrase, "Rav lachem benei levi," (<I>Bamidbar</I> 16:7)- It is too much for you what you are asking- states that as Moshe responds to Korach's group "Rav lachem" Hashem says to Moshe, "Rav lach." Moshe, we know, wanted more <I>mitzvos</I> to fulfill, which is why he yearned to enter <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>. Similarly, those who joined Korach wanted an even closer personal relationship with <I>Hashem</I>. The Eben Ezra maintains that this position was in reaction to the loss of sanctity and privilege that was taken from the <I>Bechorim</I> - first born of all the tribes- and given to the <I>Leviim</I>. That these 250 men wanted more spirituality may be seen by the fact that whereas the <I>korban</I> offering of a wicked person is rejected, "<I>Zevach reshaim toevah</I>" - the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination-  (Proverbs 21:27), here the 250 pans used for offering the <I>ketores</I> - incense- was treated with sanctity and used as a cover for the <I>mizbeach</I>. </P>
<P>Why then did Korach and his group fail? The answer we are taught in the <I>medrash</I> is that Korach was motivated and prompted by jealousy. Feeling personally slighted by the fact that his cousin, the son of his uncle Uziel, was chosen as the head of the head of the family of Kehas , when Korach believed himself to be the more eligible and natural candidate, led Korach to rebel. However, once Korach's motivation was for personal gain and honor, though cloaked in a quest for holiness, his mission could not succeed.</P>
<P>The very significant lesson that emerges from the Korach story is that one must examine his mitzvos. The Gemora (<I>Eruvin </I>13b<I>)</I> teaches that for two and a half years the schools of Shammai and Hillel disputed and finally concluded, "it were better for man not ot have been created, but now that he has been created, let him be <I>yifashfaish b'maasav</I> (investigate his deeds) and <I>yimashmaish b'maasav</I> (examine his deeds)". In Chapter three of <I>Mesilas Yesharim</I> Rav Moshe Chaim Luzatto zt"l explaisn the former, <I>yifashfaish</I>, to be to investigate one's wrongdoings and transgressions, and the latter, <I>yimashmaish</I>, to scrutinize one's <I>mitzvos</I> and good deeds to make sure they are as perfect and wholesome as possible without personal <I>negias</I> (agendas).</P>
<P>It is interesting to note that the Gemora (<I>Sukah</I> 49b) understands the passage in Micha (6:8) which states, "What Hashem seeks from you: only you performance of justice, the love of kindness, and walking humbly with G-d" to refer to one's conduct at a funeral and wedding. Both the one eulogizing the dead and making merry before the <I>chosson</I> and <I>kallah</I> (groom and bride) need to be cautioned that their motives must be pure, and personal attention not be a conscious aspect of the performance of the <I>mitzvah</I>.</P>
<P>One has to scrutinize one's <I>mitzvos</I> - they are good, but are they good enough? The <I>Medrash Rus Rabba</I> notes that the Torah (<I>Bereishis</I> 37:22) informs us of Reuven's positive motivation for suggesting that Yosef be thrown into the pit, i.e., that Reuven was "intending to rescue him from their hand, to return him to his father". Had Reuven known that scripture would record this incident, he would have personally carried Yosef on his back in order to return him to Yaakov. Had Aaron known that the Torah would record his selfless acceptance of his brother Moshe's position of leadership, instead of  "Behold he is going out to meet you," (<I>Shmos</I> 4:14) he would have orchestrated a brass band. And, had Boaz only known that his lunch of bread dipped in vinegar would be inscribed in <I>Megillas Rus</I> he would have served a steak dinner. All of the above were involved with <I>mitzvos</I>, but there is room for improvement. </P>
<P>Finally, just as "<I>mitzvos</I> require <I>kavannah</I>" - intent and awareness - is understood in the realm of <I>mitzvos</I> between man and <I>Hashem, </I>such as prayer, <I>lulav</I> or <I>shofar</I>, (as recorded in <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> <I>Orach Chaim</I>, Ch. 60:4), similarly, in performing a <I>mitzva</I> towards another man, prior to the action one should focus on the fact that they are about to perform a <I>mitzva</I>. The Rav miBartenura, in his opening commentary to <I>Avos,</I> asks why it is that <I>Pirkei Avos </I>begins with "Moshe received the Torah at Sinai and transmitted it to Johua." He explains that lest one think that only the legal aspects of Torah are Divine, but the character ethics and morals of the Jew are human in origin, <I>Avos </I>teaches us that <I>nichum aveilim</I> is not simply a social obligation known as a "<I>shiva</I> call," and <I>bikkur cholim</I> is not only a good thing to do. Prior to entering a <I>shiva</I> house or hospital, we should say to ourselves, "I am about to perform a <I>mitzva</I>." Every morning Jews recite, "we are fortunate (<I>ashreinu</I>), how good is our position, how pleasant is our lot." Things are good, let us make them better! We are surrounded by <I>mitzvos</I>, and <I>Parshas Korach </I>beckons our scrutiny thereof. </P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P><I>Parshas Lech Lecha</I> presents us with the unfolding of Jewish history. Avraham is the first Jew, not the first monotheist. The greatness of Avraham as told to us in <I>Bereishis</I> (18:19) is his capacity to transmit his values and beliefs to subsequent generations, something that his great predecessors including Chanoch, Noach, Shem, and Ever were not able to do.</P>
<P>The <I>Mishna</I> in <I>Avos</I> (5:4) teaches that, "<I>Asarah nisyonos nisnasa avraham avinu veamad bekulam, lehodiya kamah chibaso shel avraham avinu.</I>" Our forefather Avraham was tested with ten trials and he withstood them all, to show the degree of our forefather Avraham's love for God. Although there are different ways to reckon the exact nature of the ten tests, according to the Bartenura, seven of these tests are found in <I>Parshas Lech Lecha</I>.</P>
<P>What is the purpose of a test? It is clearly for man, as Hashem knows if man will pass the test or not. The Ohr HaChaim in his commentary on <I>Bereishis</I> (3:4,5) asks why Hashem tested the first couple with the snake? The Ohr HaChaim posits the thesis that ultimately it is in man's best interest to be challenged, and pass the test. Moreover, the reward received is commensurate with the energies expended in passing the test, as we are taught in <I>Avos</I> (5:23) "<I>Lefum tzaara agra </I>"- commensurate with the pain/difficulty and struggle is the gain and personal reward. The very term "<I>nisayon</I>" (test or trial) comes from "<I>ness</I>" (banner). Each triumph over a test elevates the individual. Without the test there is no personal advancement or growth.</P>
<P>Avraham was not born "Avraham <I>Avinu</I>"- our father, rather he developed and matured his relationship with Hashem by successfully overcoming his natural instincts and living a life dedicated to higher ideals. The Torah teaches us in <I>Bereishis </I>(15:5) that Hashem took Avraham outside to count the stars and say to him "<I>koh yehiye zaracha"</I> - Thus shall be your seed. In addition to the literal interpretation that his offspring would be as numerous as the stars, Rashi cites the <I>medrash</I> which teaches that Hashem removed Avraham from the natural circumstances of this world and informed him that Avram would not have a son but <U>Avraham</U> would; Hashem would change his name and his destiny. Rashi (17:1) explains the significance of adding the letter <I>hey</I> to Avram's name as signifying Avraham's ability to control and master morally five organs (eyes, ears, and procreation).  Avram grows into Avraham. Rav Chaim Yaakov Goldwicht zt"l, founding Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivas Kerem B'yavne, explains that the <I>pasuk</I> "<I>koh yehiye zaracha"</I> - "Thus shall be your seed" - can be interpreted as saying that so to will your children possess the ability to rise above their challenges and pass their tests. This may be seen from the Medrash Braishis Rabbah (87:8) that attributes Yosef's ability to "flee and run <U>outside</U>" (Braishis 39:15) and pass his test to the merit of his great-grandfather Avraham, regarding whom we are told similarly, "<I>vayotse oso ha'chutsa</I>" - "Hashem brought him <U>outside"</U>.</P>
<P>The Gemara Sanhedrin (107a) teaches in the name of R. Yehuda in the name of Rav, "a person should never bring himself to a test", i.e., should not intentionally place himself into a situation in which he will be tested to sin, for King David brought himself to a test and stumbled and succumbed to temptation. David asked Hashem why could he not be included in the opening blessing of the Shemoneh Esray, and amend the blessing to read, "God of Avraham, God of Issac, God of Jacob, and God of David". Hashem answered that the three patriarchs were tested by Him and withstood the tests, whereas David had not been tested. David then asked to be tested. Hashem agreed and even told him that the test would be in the area of physical temptation. Though forewarned, that night David sinned with Bat-Sheva.</P>
<P>It is true that every morning we pray "do not bring us into the power of error, nor into the power of transgression and sin, nor into the power of challenge", as we are fearful that we will not pass the test. Rav Chaim Shmulevitz zt"l in his Sichos Mussar (5733:6) explains that when Hashem tests an individual, He provides them as well with the ability to withstand the test. Hashem only tests those that can pass. However, when one brings a test upon himself, he is not necessarily awarded the divine assistance needed to pass the test.</P>
<P>We conclude the <I>Hallel</I> with "<I>o'dcha ki anisani</I>" - "I thank you Hashem for answering me". The Malbim understands this to mean, I thank you for the challenges and difficulties you have placed before me, cognizant, as the Ohr Hachayim teaches, that "the greater the physical and spiritual effort to overcome potential impediments to our faith, the greater the reward stored up in Heaven for such acts of faith".</P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The laws of <I>kashrus</I> and forbidden foods constitute much more than 13 out of 17 <I>mitzvos</I> found in <I>Parshas Shemini</I>. Rashi, in his commentary (<I>Vayikra</I> 11:45) notes that throughout the Torah, the term used to describe the exodus from Egypt is "<I>hotzeticha</I>" - "who brought you out from the land of Egypt." Here, in summarizing the laws of forbidden foods, the Torah uses the language of "<I>hamaaleh</I>"- "For I am <I>Hashem </I>who has elevated you up out of the land of Egypt." Dbei Rabi Yishmael taught, as cited in <I>Bava Metzia</I> (61b), that <I>Hashem</I> said, "Had I not brought the people of Israel up from Egypt except to observe this law of not consuming creeping creatures, '<I>Dai' </I>- I would have been satisfied." Thus the expression, "brought you up" is most appropriate, as Rashi further comments that it is "<I>ma'alyusa hi gabaihu"</I>, an uplifting and elevating phenomenon. </P>
<P>We are all familiar with the teaching of the Rambam (<I>Vayikra</I> 11:13) that the Torah forbids the consumption of those species whose characters and natures are cruel. One absorbs the characteristics of that which they eat, and <I>Hashem </I>wished that his nation be possessed of a kind and sterling character. He ordained that we ingest only non-carnivorous animals, and birds that do not prey on other creatures.</P>
<P>The Rambam in his <I>Egeres</I> (letter- cited in <I>Degel Machene Efraim</I>, <I>Parshas</I> <I>Eikev</I>) to a community that denied the biblical concept of <I>techiyas hamaisim</I> (resurrection of the dead) writes that the effect of the dietary laws of the Torah is that they purify man's thought process. This enables mortal man, entrenched in the physical world, to comprehend and absorb the highest level of spirituality- <I>Hashem</I>'s Torah. Commensurate with ones scrupulous attention to the details and laws of <I>kashrus</I> is one's ability to grasp greater and deeper lessons from the Torah. A significant factor contributing to the success of the <I>Ta'naim</I> and <I>Amoraim </I>(the scholars of the Talmud) was the observance of these laws. The converse, continues the Rambam, is that if one disregards the dietary laws of the Torah, you will be faced with a lack of clarity and comprehension of Torah principles. This in no small measure contributed to a community's denial of <I>techiyas hamaysim</I> in Rambam's day.</P>
<P>The phrase "you are what you eat" is then understood as not only regarding one's character, but your intellectual ability to understand <I>Hashem</I>'s Torah. This may be further clarified by the classification of the Kuzari (Part 5) of all physical entities into four categories: minimal, plant life, animals, and man. To this he adds the Jew as a fifth phenomenon. Just as there is a marked difference between the highest form of plant life (the cedar tree) and the lowest form of animal life (the ant), similarly there is a distinction between the Jew and the rest of mankind. The soul of the Jew differs qualitatively from that of mankind, as we recite in the blessings after the Torah portion has been read, "who has given us the Torah of truth, and implanted eternal life within us". <I>Kashrus</I> in no small measure helps us attain this eternal life.</P>
<P>Finally it is interesting to note the blessing of <I>Borei Nefashos,</I> which is recited after eating any food for which neither <I>Birchas Hamazon</I> (Grace After Meals) nor the Three Faceted Blessing applies, such as fruits, vegetables, and beverages other than wine. This blessing thanks <I>Hashem</I> for creating Man, and indeed all species, lacking. All living organisms need nourishment. We continue to thank <I>Hashem</I> for providing this life-sustaining nourishment. The blessing concludes,  "blessed is He the life of the worlds". The word "worlds" is in the plural because His sustenance provides us with this world, and the realization thereof that He sustains us, and with our <U>kosher</U> diet, provides us with our worthiness of and entry into the next world.</P>
<P>This is Rashi's theme at the end of <I>Parshas Shmini</I> (11:44) "just as I am holy, for I am the Lord your God, make yourselves holy, for I will sanctify you above and in the world to come." There is much more to <I>kashrus</I> than do's and don'ts!</P>

<P>The Torah prescribes (mitzva 526 in the
Sefer Hachinuch) that prior to going to war (<I>milchemes r&#146;shus</I>
&#150; an &#147;optional&#148; war. For example, a war to expand the

<P>The Talmud (Sotah 44a) has a dispute
regarding the last exemption. Rav Akiva believes it is to be taken
literally, and this is how the Rambam in the Laws of Kings (7:15)
rules. Rav Yosi Haglili, however, understands the verse to be a
fantastic cover-up. The fearful person is one who is afraid of sins
he as committed. While the Torah earlier (Dvarim 20:4) assures the
Jewish people, &#147;for Hashem your god is the one who goes with
you, to fight for you with your enemies, to save you&#148;, the
sinner is nervous that this refers only to those worthy of special
divine protection. The Torah lists three circumstances so that when
the solider leaves the battleground people will attribute his
departure to one of the listed circumstances. The Torah is especially
sensitive to the feelings and character of the sinner. Rather than
leave to our imagination what type of sin would exempt the Jewish
solider, the Talmud (Sotah 44b) informs us. The transgression is
having spoken and interrupted between the hand and head <I>T&#146;filin</I>.</P>

<P>The Talmud (Menachos 36a) teaches that
one is forbidden to speak or interrupt between he donning of the hand
and head <I>T&#146;filin</I>. In the Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim
25:9,10) this is codified, and moreover, if one hears even a <I>davar
Shebikedusha</I> (<I>kadish</I>, <I>kedusha</I>, <I>borcho</I>)
between his hand and head <I>T&#146;filin</I> he is to listen but not
respond. AT first glance this seems most strange. This is the sin he
is afraid of? It appears to be but a misdemeanor!</P>

<P>I&#146;d like to suggest that the
severity of his act can be understood if we examine the purpose of
the the two <I>T&#146;filin</I>. The Chinuch in mitzvah 421 and
similarly this is reflected in the <I>L&#146;shaim yichud</I>
(declaration of intent) before putting on <I>T&#146;filin</I> which
states that the hand <I>T&#146;filin</I> is to train the Jew to
channel his actions to Hashem, while the head <I>T&#146;fillin</I>
reflects the intellect and beliefs of the Jew. Ideally there is no
gap and separation between the two. If however one pauses between the
hand and head <I>T&#146;filin</I> believing that it his his actions
that bring victory and success on the battlefield, such an individual
is not to represent or fight on behalf of <I>Klal Yisroel</I>.</P>

<P>It is interesting to note that the Tur
(Orach Chaim 51) cites a Yerushalmi that if one interrupts between
<I>Yishtabach</I> (closing blessing of <I>Pesukei D&#146;zimra</I>)
and <I>Yotser Ohr</I> (the first blessing of the next section which
is comprised of the Shema and its blessings), that individual returns
from the battlefield. Perhaps this may be explained similarly in
light of the following: the Menoras HaMeor suggests that the term
&#147;<I>Pesukei D&#146;zimra</I>&#148; might have an additional
meaning other than &#147;Verses of Song and Praise&#148;. The Hebrew
word <I>&#145;zmr&#146;</I> can also be a verb which means to prune.
Thus the introduction to the <I>shacharis</I> prayer is designated as
&#147;verses of pruning or cutting&#148;. Just as a gardener prunes
his vines, removing the unhealthy branches in order to improve the
fruit-bearing ability of the superior ones, so too recitation of
<I>Pesukei D&#146;zimra</I> removes all spiritual and metaphysical
obstructions and hindrances from our prayers, enabling our prayers to
enter before the divine throne. <I>Pesukei D&#146;zimra</I> may thus
be seen as man&#146;s struggle to break through the many layers of
impurity in his environment and enable him to connect with the Holy.
Here too, there cannot be success with <I>&#145;zmr&#146;</I> without
the <I>shema yisroel</I>. If one believes he can rid society of its
immorality and problems without <I>shema yisroel</I>, he is &#147;to
return from the battlefield&#148; or, more succinctly, cannot
represent <I>Klal Yisroel</I>.</P>

<P>The strong connection between one&#146;s
military initiatives and a spiritual base may be demonstrated from
the following two historical events. In parshash Matos. Moshe
assembles a force to fight against Midyan. &#147;A thousand from a
tribe, a thousand from a tribe&#148; (Bamidbar 31:4). The Midrash
Tanchuma understands that the repetition in the <I>pasuk</I>
indicates that each tribe provided a thousand warriors to fight as
well as a thousand warriors to pray. Those who prayed were the real
warriors, as explained in Rashi (Bamidbar 31:8), &#147;Israel is
victorious by virtue of its prayers&#148;.</P>

<P>In addition, the Talmud (Berachos 54a)
teaches that if one sees a place where a miracle occurred to the
Jewish nation, he recites a blessing, &#147;blessed is the one who
performed miracles for our ancestors at this location&#148;. The
Talmud states that if one sees the stone upon which Moshe sat when
the Jewish nation fought successfully against Amalek he is to recite
the above blessing. The Maharsha (Berachos 54b) asks: did not the
military victory take place in the valley, while Moshe sat high on
the mountain? The Maharsha answers the question by explaining that
the real miracle was the acceptance of Moshe&#146;s prayer.</P>

<P>The Baal Hatanya explains the name
Amalek to be a derivative of &#147;<I>m&#146;lika&#148;</I>, which is
a severing or separation. Amalek separated between recognizing and
knowing God, which they did, and acting on that knowledge, which they
did not.</P>

<P>We are living in most difficult times,
<I>Eretz Yisroel</I>, and indeed the Jewish nation, is at war. The
timely message of Parshas Shoftim is most critical: we need <I>Tzahal</I>
&#150; a Jewish army &#150; but our success will only come when we
recognize that victory comes from Hashem. We cannot interrupt between
the hand and head <I>T&#146;filin</I>, nor between <I>Yishtabach</I>
and <I>Birchas Krias Shema</I>.</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vayechi]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<I><P>Parshas Vayechi</I> contains a fascinating concept, that of <I>zechus avos, </I>merit of our fathers,  which is worth consideration. <I>Zechus Avos</I> teaches us to draw from the account of our ancestors, so that even if we are not worthy of a particular divine response, we can invoke their righteousness and pray that in their merit we will be awarded our requests. It is for this reason that we begin every <I>Shemonah Esrei</I> with the <I>bracha</I> of <I>Avos</I>, and invoke the <I>akeidah</I> as a central theme on Rosh Hashana.</P>
<P>The Yitav Panim notes that upon reflection the converse of the above is also true. Hashem looks to the future, to the positive actions that will take place, and can influence the present. At the burning bush, Moshe asks Hashem, "Who am I that I should go to Paroh, and that I should take the Children of Israel out of Egypt (<I>Shmos</I> 3:11)." Rashi understands this question to mean, "How have the Jews merited their redemption?" Hashem responds in the next verse, "There is a great happening in store for them, they rwill serve God on this mountain and receive the Torah there." The future receiving of the Torah enabled them to leave Egypt. </P>
<P>Similarly, the commentary Maasei Hashem explains the verse in <I>Parshas Noach</I>, "And Hashem smelled the fragrant odor [of the offerings Noach brought] "and said, I shall not again curse the land for the sake of man (8:21)." The use of the term "<I>raiach ha-nichoach</I>", fragrant odor, both here and the many times it occurs in the book of <I>Vayikra</I>, indicates that Hashem looked to the future. Just as one can smell an object from a considerable distance prior to either seeing or touching it, similarly, when one brings an offering, one is saying that they wish to change and correct either a particular act or character flaw. Thus, it is understandable that in the merit of future good deeds that a person will do, Hashem, who 'smells' them now, will pardon the individual. The Medrash Braishis Rabbah (34:9) interprets the smelling of Noach's offering to refer to the scent of Avraham emerging from the furnace in which Nimrod attempted to kill him. In addition, Hashem 'smelled' Chananyah, Mishael, and Azarya emerging from the furnace of Nevuchadnezar. Finally, the Medrash teaches that Hashem 'smelled' the generations of <I>shmad</I> (religious persecution) where Jews would be prepared to give their lives and resources to honor Hashem. Future generations are clearly saving the present.</P>
<P>The closing paragraph of Medrash Rabbah on Parshas Braishis (29:5) teaches in the name of Rav Simone, "it is known that Hashem will do kindness with later generations in the merit of earlier ones", as we find in Vayikra (26:45) "Hashem promises to remember the covenant of the first ones" referring to the tribes He took out of Egypt. Rav Simone then presents the source from which we know that Hashem will provide for those in need now in the merit of future generations, i.e.,  the juxtaposition of the closing verse of Bereishis with the opening verse of Noach. </P>
<P>Why did "Noach found favor in the eyes of Hashem"? Because of "these are the progeny of Noach". His children and their descendants saved him!</P>
<P>On the opening verse of <I>Parshas</I> Toldos, the Medrash (63:2) cites the verse from Mishle (17:6) "Fathers are a crown and protection (for) their sons, and sons are a crown and protection for their fathers". Moreover, Avraham, who saved Noach, was himself saved from the furnace in the merit of his grandson Ya'akov, as it says in Isaiah (29:22), "therefore says the Lord concerning the house of Jacob, who redeemed Abraham".</P>
<P>This startling concept is one that we participate in daily. The <U>Siduro Shel Shabbos</U> discusses the verse (Shmos 14:30), "and the Lord saved Israel on that day".  He explains that Hashem performed the great miracle of splitting of the Red Sea, though both the Egyptians and the fleeing Jewish nation were idolators, because the Jewish nation would praise Hashem for their  salvation daily ("<I>az Yashir</I>" in the daily morning prayers). This daily recitation at the end of <I>pesukei d'zimar</I> substantiates the historical acts.</P>
<P>This fascinating idea is highlighted in this week's <I>parsha</I> of Vayechi. When Yaakov insists on giving preference to Ephraim, though he was younger than Menasheh, he insists "I know, my son, I know (that he is the first born). He, too, will be a people, and he too will be great, Gideon for whom Hashem will perform a miracle is destined to come from him. But his younger brother will be greater than he, Joshua being destined to descend from Ephraim, will inherit the land and teach Torah to Israel" ( Bereishis  48:19 according to Rashi). "And he placed Ephraim before Menashe." Though Menashe was the firstborn and perhaps superior to his brother, Ephraim took precedence because of the future.</P>
<P>If this is true based upon Yaakov's prophetic abilities, than certainly Hashem, who knows the future, operates with this principle. Hashem substantiates Yaakov's preference of Ephraim over Menashe when arranging the order of the princes bringing their gift offerings at the dedication of the <I>mishkan</I> (sanctuary). On the seventh day of the dedication ceremonies an offering was brought by the Prince of Ephraim and on the eighth day, by the Prince of Menashe (<I>Bamidbar </I>7:48).</P>
<P>The Yitav Panim explains that this provides further incite into the blessing we recite prior to lighting the Chanukah menorah. In the blessing, we thank Hashem for the miracles performed on behalf of our ancestors, in those days at this time. The final phrase, "<I>bazman hazeh</I>", is understood by the Yitav Panim as not only clarifying the date, but that it is in the merit of nowadays. Hashem performed the miracle of Chanukah then, though they were not fully deserving of it, because of "<I>bazman hazeh</I>", His seeing that in the future generations would sing His praises, thanking Hashem for this miracle and salvation from our enemies. Once again the future saved the past!</P>
<P>The powerful, insightful lesson that emerges is the phenomenal worth of each individual. Every action is important and significant, not only for the individual and future generations, but to vindicate the kindness that Hashem did for our ancestors, after all Hashem puts his trust in us!</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: yisro]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>There is a dispute in the <I>Gemora Zevachim</I> (116A) whether Yisro came together with Moshe's wife and sons prior to <I>matan Torah</I>, as is written in the Torah, or did he come after <I>matan Torah.</I> (The Ramban if of the opinion that Yisro came, as it is presented in the text, before <I>mattan Torah</I>, while Even Ezra is of the opinion that Yisro came a year later, after the <I>Mishkan</I> was built). One of the main points of dispute in the <I>Gemora</I> is whether <I>B'nai Noach</I> offered the <I>korban shelamim</I>. Since we are taught that <I>B'nai Noach</I> did not offer <I>shelamim</I>, and Yisro offered <I>helamim</I>, as it says in <I>Shemos</I> (18:12), "And Yisro, the father-in-law of Moshe, took and <I>olah</I> and <I>zevachim</I>". The term <I>zevachim</I> following the term <I>olah</I>, explains the Maharsha, means <I>Shelamim</I>. Thus Yisro's offering the <I>korban shelamim</I> demonstrates his joining <I>B'nai Yisroel </I>(who, as taught in <I>Shemos</I> (24:5), offer <I>shelamim</I> at Sinai) after <I>kabalas hatorah</I>.</P>
<P>The notion that a <I>Ben Noach</I> can not bring a <I>shelamim</I> is discused further by the <I>Seforno</I> who cites Naaman, the captain of Aram, who, when cured from his <I>tzoraas</I> by the prophet Elisha, proclaimed his intention for <I>geirus</I> by saying (Kings II 5:17), "For your servant will never again offer a burnt <I>olah</I> offering or any <I>zevach</I> sacrifice to other Gods, but only to Hashem". Here too the "<I>zevach" </I>following the <I>olah</I> refers to <I>shelamim</I>, and the opportunity that he would first now himself thereof.</P>
<P>Why might it be that prior to Sinai, only <I>olos</I> (burnt offerings) were brought, and after Sinai, <I>B'nai Yisroel</I> were given the opportunity to bring <I>shelamim</I>?</P>
<P>Rav Hirsch <I>zt"l</I> in his commentary on the Torah explains that a <I>shelamim</I>, of which the greater part of the animal has first been sacrificed to Hashem, is also enjoyed by the one who brought the <I>Korban</I> himself. This establishes the truism that worthwhile material enjoyment can itself become a divine service. Moreover, the Torah is a <I>Toras Chaim</I>, and as such can be <I>mekadesh</I> (sanctify and elevate) all of life. It is therefore understandable that there is a mitzvah to eat three meals on Shabbos, for the very act of eating is not looked upon as an end in itself, but rather a type of, "<I>M'shulchan gavoa ka-zachu</I>" (one is benefiting from the table of G-d). Those partaking of the meals can experience the presence of Hashem, through <I>b'rachos, divrei Torah, </I>and <I>zemiros</I>.</P>
<P>It is interesting to note that the <I>Gemora</I> in <I>Pesachim</I> (68b) which presents a dispute between R' Eliezer and R' Yehsoshua. R' Eliezer holds that on <I>Yom Tov</I> an individual has a choice of either  eating and drinking or studying Torah. R' Yehoshua is of the opinion that the day is to be divided, half of the day should be devoted to eating and drinking, and half of it to Torah study. While they argue regarding <I>Pesach</I> and <I>Sukkos</I>, the Talmud teaches, "both agree that <I>Shavuos</I> (<I>Atzeres</I>) requires the component of food, as it the day that the Torah was given." (Similarly, on Purim one of the reasons for Purim <I>Seuda</I> (festive meal) is that on Purim there was a re-acceptance of Torah on the part of the Jewish Nation.) Torah provides us with the know-how and ability to sanctify the mundane and hence the offerings of <I>shelamim</I> commenced with with <I>matan Torah</I>. The notion of sanctifying the mundane is unique to <I>Am Yisroel</I>, and foreign to the <I>Ben-Noach</I>.</P>
<P>I would like to suggest another reason for Yisro's bringing of <I>shelamim</I> after Sinai. The <I>Meshech Chochma</I> (<I>Shemos</I> 18:12) suggests that the <I>korban shelamim</I> that Yisro brought was that of a <I>korban todah</I>, a thanksgiving offering. This offering was in appreciation for his being accepted as a convert into the Jewish nation. It is for this reason that the Torah identifies the menu, that Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat bread with the father-in-law of Moshe before Hashem." The <I>Meshech Chochmah</I> says that the bread  represents the 40 loaves (30 <I>matzoh</I> and 10 <I>chametz</I>) that the Torah prescribes (<I>Vayikra </I>7:12) as an accompaniment to the <I>korban todah</I>. Moreover, perhaps Aaron's presence is noted to teach us that he came in the official capacity of <I>kohain </I>to receive his share of the four loaves that had a status of <I>terumah</I> and were forbidden to the non-<I>kohain</I>. </P>
<P>Regarding the <I>korban todah</I>, the Netziv, in his commentary on <I>Parshas Tzav</I>, suggests an explanation as to why it is that on the one hand this <I>korban </I> is like <I>kodshim</I> <I>kalim</I> (the lesser sanctified offerings) in that it could be eaten throughout <I>Yerushalayim</I> , and yet, like the <I>kodshei kodshim</I> (more sacred offerings) could only be eaten for one day and one night. (<I>Kodshim kalim</I> can be eaten for two days and one night.) He suggests that the Torah realized that an individual offering a thanksgiving offering could not consume it in its entirety  in one day. Therefore, by necessity, he would have to invite others to share his offering with him. </P>
<P>Perhaps this is another unique characteristic of <I>shelamim</I>. It is a vehicle through which one may reach out to others to share a religious experience. At Sinai, when the Jewish nation recited "<I>Naaseh</I>" (<I>Shemos 19:8</I>) it was a communal commitment to Torah. The <I>Meshech Chochmah</I> notes that it was impossible for any single individual to observe all 613 commandments. Some apply only to a <I>kohain</I>, king, or the body of Sanhedrin. It is only together that we can keep all of Torah. To the <I>Ben Noach</I>, <I>olos</I> represent mans' absolute devotion to God. This they can understand. However, that idea of a religion incorporating <I>bein adam lechavero</I>, a direct responsibility between fellow men, was something initiated at Sinai.</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: hagadol]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>&#9;The <I>Haftorah</I> of <I>Shabbos HaGadol </I>ends with one of the last passages from <I>Malachi </I>which speaks of Hashem's sending Eliyahu before the coming of the <I>"yom Hashem <U>haGadol</U> v'haNorah,"  </I>"the great and awesome day," a reference to the coming of the <I>Mashiach</I>, the redeemer. (Some even suggest that it is from this passage that <I>Shabbos <U>HaGadol</I></U> received its title.)  The obvious connection to the holiday of <I>Pesach</I> is Chazal's tradition that <I>"b'nissan nig'alu uv'nissan asidin lhiga'el," </I> "in <I>Nissan</I> they were redeemed, and in <I>Nissan</I> they will be redeemed" (see <I>L'vush </I>430).</P>
<P>&#9;This statement appears puzzling since we believe that the <I>Ge'ula </I>could arrive at any time, suddenly, without warning. This is highlighted in the <I>"Ani Ma'amin"</I> which many recite daily. There, we state <I>"achakke lo b'chol yom sheyavo,"  </I>"I await his [the <I>Mashiach's</I>]<I> </I>coming every day."  Clearly, then, the time of <I>ge'ula </I>is not limited to the month of <I>Nissan</I>!</P>
<P>&#9;The Talmud in <I>Sanhedrin </I>(98a) poses a contradiction between two phrases in <I>Yeshaya </I>(60:22). There, the prophet states: <I>"Ani Hashem b'ita achishena," </I>"I am Hashem, I will hurry it [the Redemption] in its time."  Whereas "in its time" implies a predetermined, set time for redemption, "I will hurry it" implies an earlier salvation. The <I>Gemara</I> resolves this contradiction by noting that there are two possibilities for <I>ge'ula.  </I>If we merit, it will arrive early; if not, it will be in its time. Consequently, we can suggest that the tradition of the <I>Ge'ula</I> occurring in <I>Nissan </I>refers to the Redemption in its prescheduled time.  The hurried salvation can arrive at any time, without notice.</P>
<P>&#9;Indeed, the Brisker Rav, Rav Yitzchak Ze'ev Soloveitchik, uses this principle to resolve a seeming anomaly in the <I>"Ani Ma'amin."</I>  Of the 13 principles of faith delineated in this list, the belief in the Messiah and Redemption is the only one that includes an implicit question and answer.  There we say: <I>"v'af  'al pi sheyisma'mei'ah im kol zeh achakke lo b'chol yom sheyavo," </I>"and even though he [the <I>Mashiach</I>] tarries, with all this, I still await his arrival every day." At first glance, we are merely reaffirming our faith in the ultimate Redemption, teaching ourselves not to lose hope even after we have experienced so many years of Exile. However, we do not use a similar formulation in any of the other statements of our creed.  For example, we do not state: "I believe that G-d rewards the righteous and punishes the wicked, and even though we find sometimes that the righteous suffer and the wicked prosper, nonetheless we still believe that these events do not alter the truth of this principle." The same could apply to all the other principles. Why, then, the unique formulation concerning redemption?  The <I>Rambam</I> (<I>Hilchos M'lachim </I>11:1) writes that one who does not believe in the <I>Mashiach</I> or <U>does not await [<I>m'chakke</I>] his arrival</U>, denies the words of the prophets as well as <I>Toras Moshe.</I>  Apparently, a crucial part of the belief in the redemption is the belief in his imminent arrival.  This is explicitly mentioned in the "Ani Ma'amin" because it is <U>part</U> of the belief. It is not just a reaffirmation of our belief; it is a separate, but integral, component of the belief in the Redemption. The existence of the possibility of a hurried <I>ge'ula,</I> then, is not just a truth, but a component of the very belief in the Redemption.<I>  </I>(See <I>Otzros Acharis Hayamim </I>Chapter 1, footnote 3, and <I>Kovetz R'shimos Shiurim 'al Maseches Bava Me'tsia, Kuntres b'Rambam Hilchos M'lachim, </I>by Rav Y. Y. Kalmenson, Chapter 1).</P>
<P>&#9;There is a fascinating parallel between these two possibilities of the Redemption and the times given for the Exodus from Egypt. Hashem informs Avraham <I>Avinu</I> that the Exile in Egypt would last 400 years (<I>B'raishis </I>15:13). Yet, tradition maintains that the actual stay was 210 years!  Rashi (<I>ibid.</I>) explains that G-d counted the 400 years from the birth of Yitzchak, "a stranger in a land not his" in a certain sense, since <I>Eretz Yisrael </I>was not conquered yet.  However, the simple understanding of Hashem's words is that the actual Exile was to be 400 years.  Apparently, then, the original period was shortened to allow the Jews to leave earlier. In the very first Exodus, then, we have these two possibilities of redemption spelled out: the set time of 400 years and the hurried redemption which took place after 210 years. Commentaries suggest that the workload in <I>Mitzrayim</I> was increased immediately after Moshe's first communication to Pharaoh to "squeeze in" all of the required servitude in only 210 years so that the Jews could leave earlier. (Also see Rav Sa'adia Gaon in his <I>Emunos V'Dei'os, </I>Chapter 8, for a slightly different approach to these different dates for the Exodus.)</P>
<P>&#9;Several methods and approaches exist in order to hasten the redemption. <I>T'shuva </I>(<I>D'varim </I>30:2-3)<I>, T'fila (Yeshaya </I>21:11)<I>, </I>and longing for the Redemption (<I>Yalkut Shimoni T'hillim </I>736) can bring the <I>Ge'ula </I>more quickly. A generation wholly undeserving can also cause an earlier redemption (<I>Sanhedrin </I>98a)  presumably based on Hashem acting <I>"lma'an sh'mo,"  </I>for the sake of His own Name (see <I>Yechezkel </I>36:22-24).  Increased <I>yissurin</I> or suffering can also rush the <I>ge'ula </I>as it did in <I>Mitzrayim </I>(see <I>Sanhedrin ibid. </I>and <I>Ohr HaChayim </I>to <I>VaYikra </I>25:25-28).</P>
<P>&#9;The <I>Chafetz Chayim</I> gives an inspiring <I>mashal</I>, analogy, showing how we can hasten the <I>ge'ula </I>in our time and not despair by comparing ourselves to earlier, greater generations who did not merit redemption in their period.  The Torah rules that inherited land sold in <I>Eretz Yisrael </I>can be bought back, "redeemed," from the purchaser according to the number of years left to <I>Yovel </I>(<I>Vayikra </I>25)<I>.  </I>If the field is not redeemed by then, the field automatically goes back, for free, at the <I>Yovel.  </I>So it is with the our Redemption.  When the set time of redemption comes, we are saved automatically even without the merit necessary for a hurried <I>ge'ula</I>.  However, we can "redeem" ourselves earlier through payment, this being <I>T'shuva, Torah </I>and <I>Mitzvos , </I>or <I>Yissurin. </I>The amount and degree depend on how close we are to the set time of <I>Ge'ula.  </I>Earlier generations did not merit a rushed redemption because the "debt" was greater. As we get closer and closer, the debt gets less and less.</P>
<P>&#9;Many of the great Torah sages of the past century through modern times (the Chafetz Chayim, R. Elchanan Wasserman, <I>zt"l, </I>and <I>lbchl"ch </I>R. Ovadia Yosef <I>Shlita </I>and others) have declared our age to be the era of <I>Ik'v'sa DiM'shichah,</I> the period of the "footsteps of the Messiah," based on the fulfillment of the signs of this era outlined in the last <I>Mishna</I> in <I>Maseches Sota</I>.  Some have even labeled our times as <I>"Aschalta D'Ge'ula" </I>(see <I>HaTekufa HaGedola </I>by Rav M. M. Kasher <I>zt"l</I>, and <I>Journal of Contemporary Halacha, </I>Vol. 16<I>, </I>"Land for Peace: A Halachic Perspective,"<I> </I>by <I>Mori V'Rabi</I> Rav H. Schachter <I>Shlita</I>).   Clearly, the words of the Chafetz Chayim ring louder than ever. In our post-Holocaust era and with the current wave of tragedy after tragedy in our Holy Land, we are reminded of the words of R. Yochanan (<I>Sanhedrin </I>98a), "if you see a generation with troubles befalling it like a river [constantly], await him [the Messiah]."  Let us increase our devotion to Hashem's Torah, let us pour out our hearts to Him in our prayers, let us concentrate on <I>"ki lishuas'cha kivinu kol hayom" -- </I>"for your salvation we have awaited every day" -- in our <I>Shemone 'Esrei </I>to reawaken our longing for redemption, let us better ourselves with  <I>T'shuva, </I>whether in small or large ways. May Hashem look at the suffering of His people and allow this to hurry our Redemption as well.  May we have the merit of bringing about the <I>Ge'ula </I>of <I>"Achishena" </I>immediately! <I>"V'nochal sham min ha'Z'vachim v'ha'Psachim!"</P></I>

		<title><![CDATA[<EM><P>Shevii Shel Pesach</EM>: The <EM>Yom Tov</EM> of <EM>Shirah</EM>]]></title>

<EM><P>Shevii Shel Pesach</EM> (the seventh day of Passover) is an unusual <EM>yom tov</EM> (Jewish religious holiday). Though it commemorates the extraordinary miracle of <EM>Keriat Yam Suf</EM> (splitting of the Red Sea), this theme is omitted in <EM>Emor</EM> and the other relevant <EM>parshiot</EM> in the Torah. Notwithstanding the significance of the miracle, this is the only <EM>yom tov</EM> in which the complete <EM>hallel</EM> is not recited, as it does not differ from the days of <EM>chol ha-moed</EM> with respect to its <EM>korbonot</EM> (sacrifices in the Holy Temple) (<EM>Arachin</EM> 10b). Indeed, this <EM>yom tov</EM> is completely subsumed under the broad rubric of <EM>Chag ha-Matzot</EM> (Holiday of Matzot, i.e. Passover) in <EM>parshiot Bo, Mishpatim, Emor, Pinhas,</EM> and <EM>Re'eh</EM>. While the <EM>Drishah</EM> (Tur, O.C. no. 490) cites the Maharil's view that one should formulate this <EM>yom tov</EM> in <EM>tefillah</EM> (prayer), <EM>kidush</EM> (sanctifying the day over wine), and <EM>birkat ha-mazon</EM> (grace after meals) as "<EM>yom simchatenu</EM>" ("the day of our joy") due to <EM>keriat yam suf</EM>, this position is almost uniformly rejected in favor of the continued emphasis of the exodus from Egypt and "<EM>zeman cherutenu</EM>" ("the time of our freedom").</P>
<P>There are also some indications that the <EM>shirah</EM> (song of praise) that followed the miracle may be as central to this <EM>yom tov</EM> as the event that inspired it. Indeed, the selection of a <EM>haftorah</EM> reading for this <EM>yom tov</EM> entirely ignores the specific occurrence of this day. Instead, the portion (Samuel II, 22) reflects the broader theme of <EM>shirah</EM>, faith, and gratitude. Perhaps, a brief examination of the phenomenon of <EM>shirat ha-yam</EM> (praise sung to God by the Jews after the splitting of the Red Sea) may further illuminate these emphases. </P>
<EM><P>Shirat ha-Yam</EM> is written in a special formation in the Torah, underscoring its uniqueness. At the same time, its relevance is attested to by its inclusion in the daily prayers. While it seeks to commemorate a singular event, there are indications that its significance transcends its origins. The fact that a <EM>shirah</EM> did not follow immediately in the aftermath of the <EM>makkot</EM> (plagues) or even of <EM>yeziat mizrayim</EM> (exodus from Egypt) seems to underscore that it was not just a response to a supernatural experience. Moreover, the double introduction to the <EM>shirah</EM>- "<EM>va-yiru ha-am...va-yaminu</EM>" ("and the people feared...and they believed") requires clarification. The mention of Moshe Rabbenu in conjunction with Hashem is puzzling, as well. Having articulated their faith in Hashem, is it not superfluous or even inappropriate to affirm their belief in Moshe? The term "<EM>az</EM>" ("then") - implying a transition from, as well as a connection to, what preceded it suggests that the inspiration to express <EM>shirah</EM> constitutes an important juncture in the fledgling development of <EM>Klal Yisrael</EM>. Commenting on the future tense of "<EM>yashir</EM>" ("will sing"), <EM>Chazal</EM> view this moment also as a foundation for faith in the future destiny of the nation: "<EM>'shar' lo ne'emar ela 'yashir'...mikan le-techiyat ha-meitim min ha-Torah</EM>" ("it did not state 'sang', rather 'will sing'...from here we have a source in the Torah for the future resurrection of the dead") Furthermore, there is an interesting debate as to when the <EM>shirah</EM> begins: Tosafot in <EM>Sotah</EM> sees "<EM>az yashir</EM>" as an introductory sentence, while Rambam, hil. <EM>Sefer Torah</EM>, perceives it as first verse of the shirah itself. Rambam's intriguing perspective implies that <EM>Klal Yisrael's</EM> state of awareness is an integral aspect of the <EM>shirah</EM> itself! </P>
<P>Perhaps what differentiates this miracle and the response of <EM>shirah</EM> that it engendered was precisely the timing, as well as the order and emphasis delineated in the Torah that reflected a moment of spiritual clarity for <EM>Am Yisrael</EM>. The fact that the nation did not previously respond with <EM>shirah</EM> although they had frequently encountered supernatural manifestations, demonstrates that the <EM>shirah</EM> was more than a reaction to a superficial stimulus. The double introduction in which the theme of <EM>yirah</EM> (fear) preceded that of <EM>emunah</EM> (faith),&nbsp;after a period of deliberation and reflection implied by this series of <EM>pesukim</EM>, projects, at least momentarily, the spiritual maturity of <EM>Klal Yisrael</EM> It was indeed, "<EM>az</EM>", a moment of import, with implications for the application of the concept of <EM>emunah</EM> for the future- "<EM>shar lo neemar</EM>". Thus, according to the Rambam, the verse of "<EM>az yashir</EM>" constitutes not only the introduction but the beginning of the <EM>shirah</EM>! Moreover, it is consistent with this newly discovered broader perspective that at that moment, the nation finally fully comprehended the subtle critical role of Moshe Rabbenu. An understanding of the relationship between observing the <EM>mizvot</EM>- "<EM>zeh keili ve-anveihu</EM>" ("this is my Lord and shall glorify him"), especially as expressed in Chazal's doctrine of <EM>hidur miztvah</EM> (adorning the <EM>miztvah</EM>),- and acknowledging Divine intervention- "<EM>ashirah la-Hashem ki gaoh gaah</EM>" was critical at that special moment of <EM>keriat yam suf</EM> , but is no less pivotal in daily prayer. </P>
<P>The Torah chose not to formulate a separate <EM>yom tov</EM> commemorating <EM>keriat yam suf</EM> since the primary significance of this miracle was its impact on the concept of <EM>emunah</EM> and <EM>yirat Hashem</EM> that well transcended the event. The <EM>shirah</EM> that it engendered was possibly not less important than the physical salvation of <EM>Klal Yisrael</EM>. It is appropriate, indeed, that the last day of <EM>Chag ha-matzot</EM>, the anniversary of <EM>keriat ha-yam</EM> and the <EM>shirah</EM>, be fully integrated into the celebration of <EM>yeziat mitzrayim</EM> and "<EM>zeman cherutenu</EM>", as both the miracle of <EM>keriat ha-yam</EM> and the <EM>shirah</EM> that it inspired magnificently highlight the theme of <EM>emunah</EM> and <EM>hashgahah</EM> (Divine providence) that stand at the core of the significance of the exodus from Egypt (see Ramban, end of parshat Bo) and the integrated holiday of <EM>Chag ha-mazot</EM>.</P>

		<content><![CDATA[




<P>We find ourselves in an intense period awaiting <I>zman matan Toraseinu</I>. The days of the <I>omer</I> in general, and the <I>shloshes yemei hagbola</I> in particular, challenge us to appreciate and internalize the profound significance of <I>kabolas haTorah</I>. The Ramban explains that the very purpose of <I>sefiras haOmer</I> is to connect the experience of <I>yetsias Mitzrayim</I> (the exodus from Egypt) with that of <I>ma'amad Har Sinai</I> (standing at Mt. Sinai). This linkage emphasizes the need to view our freedom from the bondage of <I>Mitzrayim</I> as a means toward heightened <I>Avodas Hashem</I>.</P>
<P>How do we prepare ourselves for the Shavuos experience? Which aspects of our <I>avodas Hashem</I> require the most considerable emphasis?</P>
<P>Unquestionably, we must approach our <I>limud haTorah</I> with a profound sense of passion, diligence, and commitment. We must perceive Torah study as an act of <I>kabolas penei haShecinah</I>, Divine revelation.</P>
<P>Rabbeinu Yonah, however, underscores <I>tikkun hamiddos</I>, perfection of character, as a necessary condition for <I>kabolas haTorah</I>. Commenting on the teaching of Rav Elazar ben Azaria, "<I>im ein derech eretz, ein Torah</I>" (Avos 3:17), Rabbeinu Yonah explains, "<I>Torah einena shochenes l'olam b'guf she'eino ba'al middos tovos</I>"; Torah can only reside in a <I>ba'al middos tovos</I>, one who posses a refined or exemplary character.</P>
<P>Interestingly, the Avudraham cites a <I>minhag</I> limiting the recitation of Pirkei Avos to the weeks between Pesach and Shavuos, highlighting <I>tikkun hamiddos</I> as a prerequisite for <I>kabolas haTorah</I>.</P>
<P>The Avnei Nezer explains that the students of R' Akiva who, <I>l'fi madreigasam</I> (at their level), failed to exhibit proper <I>kavod</I> for each other, died specifically during <I>yemei haSefira</I>, a time designated for <I>tikkun hamiddos</I>.</P>
<P>Both <I>limud haTorah</I> and <I>tikkun hamiddos</I> require our constant attention and concern. Just as the Torah characterizes the weeks of Sefira as "<I>temimos</I>" (whole; perfect), so too our commitment to <I>limud haTorah</I> and <I>tikkun hamiddos</I> must be incessant and continual. May we merit a meaningful and profoundly significant <I>kabolas haTorah.</P></I>

		<title><![CDATA[<I>Sukkos</I> and <I>Hakhail</I>: The Challenge of Integration]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Yonason Sacks]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2002]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: sukkos]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<P>Once every seven years, on the second day of <I>Sukkos</I> following the <I>shemitah</I> year, all of <I>Klal Yisrael</I> would assemble to hear the <I>melech</I> read from <I>Sefer Devarim</I>. The Rambam explains (<I>Hilchos Chagigah</I>, 3:1) that the very purpose of this <I>mitzvah</I> known as <I>hakhail</I> is to inspire the nation and to instill in each individual a passionate commitment to Torah.</P>
<P>The timing of the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>hakhail</I>, however, is somewhat surprising. During the <I>shemitah</I> year, one must refrain from guarding and working his fields. In an agricultural society, the <I>shemitah</I> year is an opportunity to put aside the daily routine and devote oneself to spiritual growth. Hopefully, as the year concludes, one emerges spiritually rejuvenated and energized, well equipped to face the challenges of the coming year. Yet, as the new year begins the Torah commands us to ascend to the <I>Beis Hamikdosh</I> to experience <I>hakhail</I>. Why is it so crucial to hear the inspiring message of the <I>melech</I> particularly at this time?</P>
<P>The <I>Meshech Chochma</I> explains the lesson of <I>hakhail</I>: "<I>L'maan yeidun derech Hashem ba'asosam m'leches sodeh v'kerem</I>" - to recognize the ways of Hashem as one works in his field and vineyard. <I>Hakhail</I> challenges each individual to integrate the experience of <I>shemitah</I> into his daily routine. Therefore, as the farmer returns to his field, he is called upon to ascend to <I>Yerushalayim</I>.</P>
<P>The message and challenge of integration and synthesis is not limited to <I>hakhail</I>, but extends to <I>Chag HaSukkos</I>. If the very purpose of <I>Sukkos</I> is to commemorate the manner in which <I>Bnai Yisrael</I> tRaveled as they left <I>Mitzrayim</I>, why do we celebrate <I>Sukkos</I>at this time of year instead of during <I>Chidesh Nissan</I>?</P>
<P>The Midrash and the Maharal underscore the apparent connection between <I>Yom HaKippurim </I>and <I>Sukkos</I>. Perhaps this link can be understood based on the lesson of <I>hakhail</I>.</P>
<I><P>Yom HaKippurim </I>is a day of <I>taharah</I>, during which we devote ourselves to spiritual growth and perfection. We strive to meet the challenge of <I>"Lifnei hashem titaharu.</I>" Unfortunately, when the day comes to an end, and we return to our daily routine, the impact of <I>Yom HaKippurim </I>diminishes. We find ourselves preoccupied with the challenges of daily life without realizing the need to integrate <I>Yom HaKippurim</I> into the other days of the year. Perhaps for this very reason, the Torah insists that soon after <I>Yom HaKippurim</I> we leave our home, our <I>diras kevah</I>, and dwell in the <I>succah</I>. Both <I>succos </I>and <I>hakhail</I> underscore the need to incorporate true <I>kedushah</I> into each day of our life.</P>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Yonason Sacks]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2002]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: tishabav]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<P>The unique character of <I>Tisha B'av</I> manifests itself in two distinct ways. Modeled after Yom Kippur, <I>Tisha B'av</I> is essentially a <I>ta'anis tsibbur</I> (a public fast). The Talmud in Pesachim (54b) explains<I>: "Ein bein Tisha B'av l'yom hakippurim ela shezeh sfeiko assur v'ze sfeiko muttar</I>" - the only difference between <I>Tisha B'av</I> and <I>Yom Kippur</I> is that whereas situations of doubt are forbidden on <I>Yom Kippur</I>, they are permitted on <I>Tisha B'av</I>. Accordingly, the <I>chamisha enuyim</I>, the five afflictions that are forbidden on <I>Yom Kippur</I> are prohibited on <I>Tisha B'av</I> as well.</P>
<I><P>Teshuva</I> (repentance), essential to <I>Yom Kippur</I>, is a central theme of the <I>krias haTorah</I> (Torah reading) on <I>Tisha B'av</I>. "<I>B'tsar l'cha u'mtsaucha kol hadevarim ha'eileh b'acharis hayomim, v'shavta ad Hashem elohecha v'shomata b'kolo</I>" (<I>Devarim</I> 4) "When you are in distress and all these things have befallen you, at the end of days, you will return unto Hashem your God and hearken to His voice."</P>
<I><P>Tisha B'av</I> however, is not merely a <I>ta'anis tsibbur</I>. The Talmud in <I>Taanis</I> (30a) teaches, "<I>Kol mitsvos hanohagos b'aveil nohagos b' Tisha B'av</I>". In addition to <I>ta'anis tsibbur</I>, <I>Tisha B'av</I> is characterized as a <I>yom aveilus</I> - a day of mourning. This aspect of the day is emphasized in the <I>haftorah</I>, "<I>asof asifem"</I>, "I shall utterly destroy them", which underscores the despair, suffering, and <I>aveilus</I> of <I>Keneses Yisrael</I>.</P>
<P>The Meiri (<I>Yoma</I> 78a) explains that because of this additional element of <I>aveilus</I>, Rav Yehoshua Ben Levi refrained on Tisha B'av from wiping his face, hands, and feet with a towel - a practice that is permitted on <I>Yom Kippur</I>!</P>
<P>Emphasizing the nature of <I>Tisha B'av</I> as a day of mourning, the Chassam Sofer <I>(Ohr Hachaim siman</I> 157) maintains that even individuals who must eat on Tisha B'av can be called to the Torah and receive an <I>aliyah</I>. He suggests that the obligation of <I>krias haTorah</I> on <I>Tisha B'av</I> is not merely a function of <I>ta'anis tsibbur</I>, but reflects the character of the day as a <I>yom aveilus</I>.</P>
<P>Although we often associate <I>tefilas neilah</I> with <I>Yom Kippur</I>, the <I>Mishna</I> in <I>Taanis</I> (26a) explains that this <I>tefilah</I> is recited on fast days decreed in times of calamity. If so, why is <I>tefilas neilah</I> not recited on <I>Tisha B'av</I>? Rav Solovietchik <I>zt"l</I> explains that unlike <I>shacharis</I>, <I>mincha</I>, and <I>ma'ariv</I> which are independent <I>tefilot</I>, <I>neilah</I> is an encompassing <I>tefilah</I> through which we beseech <I>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</I> to accept all of our <I>tefilot</I> of the day. If an individual failed to <I>daven shacharis</I>, he can nevertheless fully fulfill his obligation to <I>daven mincha</I>. Failure, however to <I>daven</I> any of the <I>tefilot</I> of <I>Yom Kippur</I>, renders <I>tefilas neilah</I> incomplete.</P>
<I><P>Ta'anis tsibbur</I> in general, and <I>Yom Kippur</I> in particular, are times of <I>kabolas tefilah</I> and we are therefore obligated to recite <I>neilah</I>. <I>Tisha B'av</I> however is characterized as "<I>sosam tefilasi</I>" (<I>Eicah</I> 3:8) - a time of <I>aveilus</I> when our <I>tefilot</I> are silenced, and hence we omit <I>tefilas neilah</I>.</P>
<P>May our <I>taanis</I> and <I>aveilus</I> elicit <I>rachamei shomayim</I> on behalf of <I>Keneses Yisrael</I>.</P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The juxtaposition of Purim and Pesach
is a <I>halachic</I> requirement. In a leap year, Purim is celebrated
in the second Adar, the one closest to Nissan, so that the two
redemptions, from Pharaoh and from Haman, will be celebrated in
consecutive months (Megila 6b). 
</P>
<P>This <I>halacha</I> reflects a
fundamental article of faith articulated by the Ramban (<I>Shmos</I>
13:16). From the great and obvious miracles, a person should deduce
and recognize the hidden miracles, which are the basis of the entire
Torah. Pesach, the anniversary of overt miracles, must be connected
to Purim, the holiday of hidden miracles. 
</P>
<P>The Ramban adds that the <I>nissim
nistarim</I> are revealed when <I>Am Yisroel</I> is punished for
abandoning the Torah and rewarded for observing it. Even the nations
of the world recognize this (Devarim 29:13, 24 and 28:10). Moreover,
Hashem's only desire is that man recognize this truth and publicize
it by communal prayer in a loud voice, as the people of Ninveh did
(Yona 3:8). 
</P>
<P>&#147;Just as when Av begins we
decrease joy, so too when Adar begins we increase joy&#148; (Taanis
29a). Rashi explains that the increased level of joy continues
through the days of Purim and includes Pesach, further underscoring
the close connection between the two holidays. 
</P>
<P>The contrast between Av and Adar
requires further analysis. The phrase "just as" (<I>k'shem</I>)
implies a logical relationship. We must, therefore, delve into the
root causes of Tisha B'Av on one hand, and Purim and Pesach on the
other. 
</P>
<P>The earliest tragedy of Tisha B'Av was
the sin of the spies (Ta'anis 29a). What was their mistake? The
<I>meraglim</I> saw the punishment of Miriam, but failed to learn a
lesson from it. For this reason, the story of the <I>meraglim</I> is
found right after the story of Miriam (Rashi, Bamidbar 13:1). What
lesson should the <I>meraglim</I> have learned from Miriam; their sin
was not <I>lashon hara</I>, but <I>motze shem ra</I> on an inanimate
object, Eretz Yisroel (13:32, see Onkelos)? 
</P>
<P>Miriam had discovered that Moshe
abstained from relations with his wife, and related this fact to
Aharon (Rashi 12:1). They said, "Hashem spoke to us too, yet, we
have not abstained from marital relations (Rashi 12:2).&#148; For
this, Miriam was punished, even though she did not intend to speak
badly of Moshe (Rashi 12:1). Hashem tells Miriam and Aharon that He
had told Moshe to abstain (Rashi 12:8). He becomes angry and afflicts
Miriam with <I>tzara'as</I>. 
</P>
<P>Miriam's basic mistake was the
misinterpretation of the facts. She thought that Moshe had decided on
his own to abstain, and she questioned his decision. In reality,
however, Moshe was commanded to do so by Hashem. Miriam's <I>lashon
hara</I> was caused by her incorrect understanding of Moshe's
situation. 
</P>
<P>The <I>meraglim</I> made a similar
mistake. They described Eretz Yisroel as a land that devours its
inhabitants (13:32). Wherever they went, they saw burials, so they
assumed that it is extremely dangerous to live there (Rashi). In
reality, Hashem arranged for numerous deaths and burials for the
forty days the <I>meraglim</I> were in Eretz Yisroel in order to
preoccupy the natives of the land with their mourning so that they
should not detect the spies. At all other times, Eretz Yisroel was
not dangerous at all. 
</P>
<P>The lesson that the <I>meraglim</I>
should have learned from Miriam was the need to be certain about the
facts before criticizing a person or a land. Miriam could have asked
Moshe, or perhaps even Hashem, why he abstained. Similarly, the
<I>meraglim</I> could have asked Moshe, or perhaps even Hashem, why
so many people died in Eretz Yisroel. Instead, based on their
misinterpretation, they criticized Moshe and Eretz Yisroel,
respectively. 
</P>
<P>Likewise, the tragedy which sealed the
fate of the first Beis Hamikdosh was based on a misinterpretation of
the facts. King Yoshiyahu did not allow Pharoh Neco to pass through
Eretz Yisroel on a military campaign. He thought that idolatry was
eliminated, and that the Jews were worthy of the <I>bracha</I>, &#147;and
a sword will not cross your land, even to pass through,&#148; (Rashi
<I>Vayikra</I> 26:6). In reality, many Jews hid their idols by
splitting them between the doors and the doorposts, thus evading
Yoshiyahu&#146;s inspectors. Yirmiyahu warned the king to let Pharoh
Neco pass through. Yoshiyahu ignored the prophet and was killed by
the Egyptians, ending the last chance to avoid the <I>churban</I> and
<I>Galus Bavel</I> (Midrash Eichah 1:53). 
</P>
<P>Contrast the causes of Tisha B'av with
the story of Purim. The exiled Jews were threatened with extinction
by Haman. Enraged by Mordechai's refusal to bow to him, Haman
persuaded Achashverosh to exterminate all the Jews (Esther 3:5-13).
The basic facts indicated that Mordechai was to blame for the
terrible death threat. In reality, however, the Jews were doomed
because they enjoyed the banquet of Achashverosh (Megilla 12a), which
had taken place nine years earlier (1:3). When told of this by
Mordechai, the Jews accepted this improbable cause, and repented by
fasting and reaccepting the Torah (9:27). Hashem, through a <I>nes
nistar</I>, reversed their fate, allowing the Jews to prevail over
their enemies, leading to the joy of Adar and Purim. (See Michtav
MeEliyahu p.76.) 
</P>
<P>Similarly, when Am Yisroel left Egypt,
the logical strategy was to flee. Yet when Moshe told them to move
closer to their pursuers, they said: we rely only on the words of
Moshe (Rashi Shmos 14:4). This led to the <I>nes nigleh</I> of <I>Kriyas
Yam Suf</I>. Thus, the increase in joy during Purim and Pesach
reflects the correction of our mistake of Tisha B'Av, which led to
the decrease in joy. 
</P>
<P>This timeless lesson has direct
relevance today. The press analyzes the military and political crisis
in Eretz Yisroel ad nauseum. The relative strength of armies and
terrorists, the attitudes of presidents, prime ministers, and
chairmen are scrutinized and constantly reevaluated. As believing
Jews, we must recall the words of the Ramban. Am Yisroel is punished
for its failure to observe the Torah properly, and the appropriate
response to crisis is loud communal prayer, accompanied, as in
Ninveh, by fasting and repentance. 
</P>
<P>Of course, political and military
leaders must pursue solutions, however elusive they seem. But Am
Yisroel must <I>daven</I>, fast and do <I>teshuva</I>. We dare not
repeat the mistakes of Tisha B'Av, by accepting situations in Eretz
Yisroel at face value, which led to incorrect despair and unwarranted
confidence, respectively. We must think of Purim, when we fasted and
repented on Mordechai's instruction that our sins, not kings, or
adherence to principle, caused the gRave threat. And of Pesach, when
we followed Moshe and not conventional military strategy. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, today we have no
prophets to tell us what to do and for what to repent. However, we
should be guided by our Torah leaders in our response to the crises
in Eretz Yisroel, and should do <I>teshuva</I> to the best of our
ability. 
</P>
<P>As we moved from Adar to Nissan,
thousands of Jews worldwide fasted and gathered to pray aloud.
Hopefully, Hashem will respond and save us naturally, as on Purim,
or, even better, supernaturally, as on Pesach. May Nissan 5762 be the
one about which it is written (Rosh Hashana 11a), in Nissan we will
be redeemed, Amen.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blowing the <I>shofar</I>, which is the primary <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>Rosh HaShana</I>, is a form of prayer. It is interesting to note that often the setting of a particular <I>mitzvah </I>contributes to its fulfillment, thus the ideal synagogue structure places the <I>chazan</I> in a low position, thereby actualizing "<I>mimaamakim</I>", "From the depths I have called You," (Psalms 130:1). Similarly, the Rosh in <I>Gemara Rosh HaShana</I> (3:4) cites the <I>Yerushalmi</I> that teaches that we are to blow the <I>shofar</I> from the narrower end as we are taught in Psalms, "<I>Min hamatzer</I>", "From the straits I called God," (118:5). The <I>shofar</I> itself is to reflect the urgent need and total dependence of man on <I>Hashem</I>. Moreover, the Talmud in <I>Rosh HaShana</I> (26b) concerns itself with the shape of the <I>shofar</I>. R' Yehudah is of the opinion that a bent <I>shofar</I> is to be used, as "On <I>Rosh Hashana</I> the more a person bows his mind," reflecting an attitude of submission and humility, the better it is.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We dare not overlook the obvious. No one would entertain the idea of eating <I>matzah</I> in the <I>Shemoneh Esrei</I>. Nor would we even consider it proper to hold our <I>lulav</I> during <I>Shemoneh Esrei</I>. Yet, the natural home of the <I>shofar</I> is the <I>Shemoneh Esrei</I>. This is seen with great clarity from the Baal Hamoer (R.H. Chapter 4) that originally the <I>shofar</I> was <U>only</U> blown in conjunction with the <I>Shemoneh Esrei, </I> a<I> </I>nd the blessings of the <I>Shemoneh Esrei</I> served as the blessings for the <I>mitzvah</I> of the <I>shofar</I> as well. However, in time, responding to the needs of the elderly, sick, and those who could not stay for the entire service, the Ravs instituted a set of <I>shofar</I> sounds prior to the <I>Shemoneh Esrei. Shofar</I> is naturally home in the <I>Shemoneh Esrei </I> as it is a form of prayer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That <I>shofar</I> is prayer may be seen from the concluding blessing of the <I>shofros</I> section of the <I>mussaf shmoneh eserei</I>, "blessed are you who hears the <I>shofar</I> sound of his people with mercy". If <I>shofar</I> is a <I>mitzvah</I> like <I>mezuzah</I> or lulav, the request that our blowing be received with mercy is most incomprehensible. However, as we are accustomed to ask thrice daily for Hashem to accept our <U>prayers</U> with mercy, it is understandable that we do likewise in regard to <I>shofar</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bais Halevi (<I>Drush</I> 15) notes a startling understanding of <I>shofar</I> as prayer. A prayer is as effective as the source from which it emanates. Indeed, the spoken word is the distinctive mark of man. The Torah (Braishis 2:7) states that Hashem blew into man's nostrils the soul of life, which the Targum translates as "<I>ruach mi-mal'lah</I>" (a spirit of intelligent speech). However, over the course of time, man sullies and misuses his divine gift of speech. <I>Lashon Harah, r'chilus, </I>and <I>nivul peh</I> are not only forbidden forms of speech, but they limit the effectiveness and proficiency of the mouth. And thus the quality of the spoken prayer is often significantly diminished. Therefore, Hashem in His kindness allows us to communicate with a region that is deeper than the spoken words, namely the <I>ruach</I> - the spirit of man. When Hashem blew of His existence into man, it meant that part of the divine is present in man. It is from this holy and pure source that the sounds of the <I>shofar</I> emanate. As this part of man is more holy, the prayer that issues forth is holier, and thus the concluding blessing asking G-d to accept the <I>shofar</I> sound of His people Israel with mercy is most understandable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blowing from the narrow edge of the <I>shofar</I> is not only for the practical convenience of the <I>baal tokeyah</I> (the one blowing the <I>shofar</I>), but is to communicate the profound urgency of the moment. I blow the <I>shofar </I>because I recognize that I am in dire difficult straits, and have no other place to turn for help. In Devarim (31:17) the Torah teaches that a time will come that the Jewish people will abrogate their covenant with Hashem and turn to other deities. At that time many troubles and afflictions will befall them, and Israel will say on that day, "is it not because my G-d is not in my midst that these ills have befallen me". Surprisingly the next verse teaches that Hashem will respond, "I shall utterly hide my face in that day". The Sforno explains that when the troubles befell the people, instead of realizing that they were sent as a punishment from Hashem, they attempted to solve their crises by turning to other venues and addresses, not realizing that they were to turn to Hashem in prayer and repentance. The <I>shofar</I> itself, which is blown from the narrow, reminds the Jew how precarious life is and how dependent he is on Hashem.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, an incredible Medrash (Devarim Rabbah - <I>Zos Habracha</I> 11:10): R. Yochanan taught in no less than ten places the Torah speaks of Moshe's pending passing. Initially, this was "<I>kal b'einav shel Moshe</I>", Moshe was not immediately overwhelmed, as he reasoned, if the Jewish people sinned major sins, yet upon my praying on their behalf Hashem forgave them, I who did not sin from my youth, certainly when I will pray on my own behalf He will forgive me. When Hashem saw Moshe's complacent attitude and his failure to burst forth in <U>immediate</U> prayer, at that time Hashem swore that Moshe would not enter the promised land. Moshe failed to see the urgency and immediacy of the crisis.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This past year has been a most difficult one for <I>Am Yisael</I>. Too often one trouble after another has the effect of de-sensitizing us to the urgency of the moment. May we learn from Moshe Rabbeinu, and truly seize the moment of <I>shofar</I> to realize the narrow and difficult straits we find ourselves, both individually and collectively, and thus realize that "<I>ein lanu l'hishaein elah al Avinu Shebashamayim</I>".</P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<I><P>"Vayechezu es ha'elokim vayoch'lu vayishtu"</I> -- "And they [the great men of Israel] saw [the presence] of G-d, and they ate and drank" (<I>Mishpatim </I>24:11).  Midrashim and commentaries interpret these verses in diametrically opposite ways.  Rashi, quoting from Midrash Tanchuma, explains that they viewed the <I>Shechina </I>in an inappropriate, haughty manner.  However, many others (see Ramban, Sforno, Rashbam, and Targum Onkelos) explain that after witnessing the Divine Presence (or after their sacrifices were accepted), they rejoiced with food and drink (or as if they partook of food and drink).</P>
<P>The component of joy that accompanies an encounter with the <I>Shechina</I> appears frequently throughout the Torah as a central element in <I>'avodat Hashem</I>.  Rav Yosef Dov Halevi Soloveitchik, <I>zt"l, </I>explained that the very definition of true <I>simcha </I>is <I>"lifnei Hashem"</I> -- when one is in the presence of the <I>Shechina. </I> Hence, the Torah on numerous occasions, states "<I>u'smachtem lifnei Hashem" </I>-- "and you shall rejoice in the presence of G-d."</P>
<P>The component of <I>simcha, </I>although important in the performance of all <I>mitzvos</I> (e.g. see Rabbeinu B'chaye in his introduction to <I>Parshas B'ha'alos'cha</I>), is especially significant concerning the <I>mitzva</I> of <I>talmud Torah.   </I>Rambam, in his Seifer HaMitzvot (<I>Mitzvas 'Asei</I> 3), describes how one can fulfill the commandment to love G-d. <I>"shenachshov v'nisbonein b'mitzvosav ... ad shenasigaihu v'nehene b'hasagaso b'tachlis ha'hana'ah</I>" --- "that we should think and analyze his <I>mitzvos </I>(a reference to <I>talmud torah) </I>... until we understand it and <U>enjoy</U>  its attainment with an extreme degree of pleasure."   Here, as opposed to other <I>mitzvos, </I> we find the component of pleasure and joy in the very description of the <I>mitzva</I> itself.  The words of R. Avraham of Sochatchov in his introduction to Eglei Tal are well known.  One should not think that the joy experienced through <I>talmud Torah</I> demotes the mitzva to a state of <I>shelo lishma</I>, not for the sake of heaven.  The opposite is true. The <U>purpose</U> of the mitzva is to experience joy. </P>
<P>An even more striking statement appears in the commentary of R. Avraham min Hahar to <I>Maseches N'darim</I> (36b). The <I>Mishna</I> there states that a <I>mudar hana'a mei'chaveiro </I>-- one who is proscribed from receiving benefit from his fellow by dint of a <I>neder </I>--  may not use his <I>sifrei kodesh</I>.  Now, <I>mitzvos lav leihanos nit'nu </I>-- generally, we don't view the pleasure received through <I>mitzva</I> performance as benefit vis-a-vis the prohibition of<I> n'darim</I>.  Why, then, can he not use his <I>s'farim</I>?  Whereas other <I>Rishonim</I> offer different answers, R. Avraham min Hahar resolves the difficulty with the above principle.  Unlike other <I>mitzvot</I>, the <I>mitzva</I> of <I>talmud Torah</I> <U>was</U> given precisely so that the student of Torah should be "<I>mishtashei'a bid'var Hashem"</I>  --  delight in the word of G-d.  He proceeds to quote <I>T'hillim (19)</I>. <I>"Pikudei Hashem y'sharim, m'sam'chei leiv" -- "</I>the commandments of Hashem are upright, they gladden the heart!" </P>
<P>The author of <I>Mesillas Y'sharim </I>opens his classic <I>mussar </I>work with the statement that man was created <I>"l'his'aneig 'al Hashem" --</I> to enjoy Divine pleasure in <I>'Olam HaBa. </I>Midrash Tanchuma (<I>Ki Savo </I>4<I>) </I> notes that the Torah really should have not been given in <I>'Olam HaZeh </I>since Hashem will teach Torah to all in <I>'Olam HaBa</I>.<I> </I>However, it was given to <I>B'nei Yisrael </I>in this world so that we should understand the Torah in <I>'Olam HaBa.  </I>Now, the World to Come is the world of <I>"nehenin miziv ha'shechina" (Brachos 17b)</I> -- enjoying the Divine radiance (which interestingly is derived from the above-qouted verse in our <I>parasha</I>).  The direct implication is that <I>limud haTorah </I> is equivalent to <I>"nehenin miziv ha'shechina."  </I>This Midrash, too, highlights for us the great pleasure and joy inherent in Torah study.  It is no less than a slice of <I>'Olam HaBa </I>right here in this world.</P>
<P>The centrality of pleasure and joy relating to <I>talmud Torah </I>and <I>Hakbalas P'nei HaShechina </I>in the <I>Mikdash </I>would appear to be related for  <I>talmud Torah </I> is also an encounter with the <I>Shechina</I> (see,  for example, Nefesh Hachayim 4:6). In the temporary absence of a <I>Beis HaMikdash</I> where the <I>Shechina </I>dwelt, only the Torah can serve as the vehicle for the encounter with the Divine.   Thus, it is not surprising that joy is so crucial regarding both of these commandments.</P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The prophet Hoshea was told by Hashem to marry a woman of ill repute, begin a family with her, and then to let her go. However, the pain of breaching the relationship, dubious in its very nature, would be too great for him to bear. Thus, Hashem gives Hoshea a glimpse into the depth of Hashem's covenant with us, one that will survive any disappointment, no matter how profound. The <I>Haftorah</I> of <I>Parshas Bamidbar</I> records this prophecy and concludes with the words, "<I>v'airastich li l'olam, viairastich li b'tzedek u'v'mishpat u'v'chessed u'v'rachamim, v'airastich li b'emunah</I>" ("and I will marry you forever, and I will marry you with righteousness and with justice and with kidness and with mercy, and I will marry you with trust") (Hoshea 2:21-22).</P>
<P>At first blush, I have often considered, we would rearrange these expressions of love. Would we not leave "forever" for a climactic conclusion, presented only after the relationship has been tested, and its substance clarified? Nevertheless, Hashem puts it first, before explaining that this relationship is about kindness, righteousness, mercy, and justice. Furthermore, we would probably believe that every bond starts with trust, as ambiguous as trust may be, rather than building up to it. However, it seems to me that the order of ideas here communicates to us an insight crucial to founding enduring and meaningful personal relationships. Indeed, if a marriage is to be successful, it must be viewed by both parties as "forever". Presumably it is only after the appropriate criteria of each party have been met that marriage is contemplated, and when the marriage is formulated, nothing short of "life long" should be envisioned. Thus, the marriage's context is created free of tests and judgements, void of places to run, and replete with sharing and realizing shared blessings. It is in that context that Hashem reminds us of the justice, righteousness, kindness, and mercy that he invests into us. Similarly, it is in an enduring marriage that spouses will generously contribute whatever is required. After all, there is precious little in life that would justify limiting efforts that can impact that which is life-long.</P>
<P>Finally, Hashem reminds us how we benefit, time and time again, from His confidence and trust in us, allowing that to override many faults and debacles.  The comfort that we have from that inviolable faith gives joy and meaning in one's most frightening and lonely moments. That this indeed describes the utmost in any relationship, I am sure will resonate well with those who enjoy trusting family bonds built on years of willingness to share all of one's blessings. May we all be blessed to understand this profoundly and personally.</P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>It was Moshe <I>Rabbeinu</I> himself beginning his final charge to the generation whom he nurtured and he correctly suspected that his children were not quite ready to listen. According to the <I>medrash</I>, as Moshe recalls debacles and setbacks his people openly question that perhaps his advanced age was finally catching up with their leader.  Sadly enough it is expecting their skepticism that Moshe, according to Rashi, had waited saving these words for the end.  Thus Moshe would be spared the aggRavation of seeing himself ignored and avoid the attendant embarrassment.  Rashi further tells us that Moshe wants all his people gathered together to eliminate any "if only I had been there" challengers, that he is sure there would be.</P>
<P>As disappointing as this may sound, especially of our fathers who merited to see the miracles of Yehoshua, I can understand them quite well.  After all, they may have honestly felt that Moshe's litany of failures did not speak to them at all.  Why should this generation, eager to enter Israel and too young to have a significant role in the sin of the <I>meraglim</I> or the <I>chet ha'egel</I> or even <I>ba'al peor</I>, have to hear about the sins of the past?  </P>
<p>It is precisely this sentiment that Yirmiyahu apparently fears and therefore addresses in one of the closing <I>pesukim</I> of Eicha (5,7):  "Our fathers sinned and are no longer and we suffer their sins. (see Targum)". Yirmiyahu has the "next" generation understanding that they are not suffering the punishment thrust upon them, rather they are suffering i.e. tolerating the elders' failures and flaws.  In contemporary terms, we and those before us may not have created the divisiveness that brought down the second <I>Beis Hamikdash</I> but we certainly have not found the formula for national harmony.  </P>
<p>Similarly Moshe realized that later generations would fall prey to the same lapses and errors and thus found it appropriate to recall these difficult events.  Unfortunately we learn that the energies to conquer all of our G-d given land did peter out during Yehushua's time.  Ultimately they did make peace with sharing the land with the native pagans and are censured for that.  True they were too young to shoulder any responsibility for the <I>chet hameraglim</I>, yet they - as we too - must be wary that our love for our land never lose its depth or the profound passion that it deserves.  Furthermore, those gathered to listen to Moshe may have never complained about the manna, yet all future generations should be concerned to be fully appreciative of Hashem's blessings and the obligations that they entail.  Finally, Moshe refers to the sin of the golden calf as the sin of "enough gold" to raise in our minds that though we did not smelt golden images we may at times suffer from the complacency that comes with comfort. </P>
<p>In Moshe's words as well, I think we can find how he responds to his children who would rather not hear him out.  Looking carefully at the <I>parsha</I> we note that Moshe closes his critical description of the sin of the spies with a seeming incomplete <I>pasuk</I>:  "(2,16) And it was when all the men of military age died from amongst the nation."  Why does the Torah give this thought an entire <I>pasuk</I> and thus close an episode whereas we would expect it as an introduction to a new <I>parsha</I>? </P>
<p>It would seem to me that the point of this <I>pasuk</I> is simply to put that moment into historical perspective.  That the nation fated to die in the desert had passed on was well known, and yet keeping it in mind creates an attitude that gives singular direction.  Moshe in this one <I>pasuk</I> gives the most disturbing and energizing <I>tochecha</I> possible. How can one not be inspired knowing that one is being granted opportunities that eluded those who came before? Clearly a generation that approaches the conquest of Israel understanding that this opportunity has been denied to their parents will focus on Israel with unprecedented strength. Thus Moshe <I>Rabbeinu</I> begs his children to study the foibles of the past so that they will internalize the opportunities and responsibilities that lay ahead. </P>
<p>Thus this unfinished <I>pasuk</I> is not a hanging thought, but rather a pregnant phrase waiting for the next generation to write its conclusion.  </P>

<P>Perhaps we have grown accustomed to having current events vividly bring alive the phrases of our age old Torah.  Nevertheless I don't think it wise to lose the opportunity to appreciate the depth and prescience of every nuance in Hashem's word.</P>
<P>This has come to mind unfortunately in the last few years as we read <I>Parshas Ha'azinu</I>, almost always as we find ourselves in introspection of the <I>Yamim Noraim</I>.   While expressing profound disappointment in us, Hashem reminds of  "<I>hester panim</I>", the times where we will feel Hashem hiding his face from us.  It is then that He lays out for us (32:21),"They have caused me to seem jealous [as they pursue] non-gods, they have angered me with their nonsense, and I will make them jealous with a non-people, I will make them angry with a foolish nation."</P>
<P>Our sages as quoted by Rashi and Ramban found in the destruction of the first <I>Beis Hamikdash</I> and the subsequent Diaspora the realization of this prophecy.  The culture of the times introduced pagan and obviously powerless and unresponsive deities into our midst.  As promised, our fling with non-gods delivered us not too long after, into the hands of the <I>kasdim</I>, a "non-people".  What gave them the <I>kasdim</I> this distinction?  <I>Chazal</I> submit that they had no land or language of their own and as testimony to their rootless-ness, they borrowed the name of the land in which they were found.  </P>
<P>My father-in-law, HaRav Zevulun Charlop shlit"a, is wont to point out that once again we are living with this verse as we are incessantly aggRavated by a non-people.  They do not have a distinctive language or culture and their history is a tapestry of myth and propaganda.  Indeed their rootless-ness is bringing them to destroy the concrete historic bonds that we do have to Yerushalayim and its holiest places.</P>
<P>How did the <I>kasdim</I> come about if they in fact come from no where?  <I>Chazal</I> explain that Hashem composed them simply to bring us into line.  Frightening as it is, it would certainly explain how an organization that began in the seventies and that has terrorized the civilized world has had such a rapid rise, a rarity in world history.  </P>
<P> To be sure, this leaves us to speculate what is the "non-god" of our own time. What are the cultural influences that we allow to fill our lives often leaving little room for that which will genuinely resonate within us.  This certainly should give us pause as welcome 5763 praying that it is replete with good news for all of us and genuine peace for us all. </P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<I><P>And it was on the way, in an inn, and Hashem met [Moshe] and sought to kill him (Shemos 4:24) </P>
</I><P>In unRaveling the story behind this story, the <I>Talmud </I>relates that a second son was born to <I>Moshe </I>and <I>Tzippora </I>as they were preparing to leave <I>Midyan </I>for <I>Mitzraim</I>.  No doubt their dedication to fulfilling <I>Hashem</I>'s command coupled with the unrelenting suffering of their brothers gave the newborn's parents no time to delay their departure.  Thus they journeyed without performing their son's <I>bris</I>, careful not to expose him neither to the threatening elements of the desert nor the discomfort of tRaveling while nursing a fresh wound.  Arriving close to <I>Mitzrayim</I>, they found lodging and could now arrange for the <I>bris</I> without slowing down the work of redemption or compromising the infant's health.  It is at this moment, their first opportunity to circumcise their baby, that <I>Moshe </I>finds himself under the deadly censure of <I>Hashem</I>.  <I>Rashi </I>explains that G-d's sudden impatience erupted when Moshe chose to first settle in to the hotel and only then to tend to the uncircumcised child. </P>
<I><P>Rashi</I>'s interpretation and its inference are almost as troubling as the very event he wishes to resolve.  It seems that though <I>Moshe </I>would have momentarily performed the <I>mitzvah</I> for which he had waited some time, <I>Hashem </I>considered killing him and squashing the nascent redemption, almost before it started.</P>
<P>Perhaps we can understand this <I>medrash<B> </B></I>through introspection into our own lives.  We are so often besieged with obligations and commitments robbing from us the feeling that we are designing our own days and our own schedules.   Over time, daily <I>minyan </I>and daily learning, community involvement and <I>chesed </I>commitments may give way to what we need to do to establish a <I>parnosoh</I>, run a home and tend to its members.  Some get accustomed to the change while for others it is a source of agony.  Some don't look back, and settle in to new expectations and adjust or limit their earlier visions.  Their lives are full of accomplishments and much reason to be comfortable and satisfied.  Others are always looking back, always wondering, always comparing, harboring a nagging frustration that demands constant assuaging in order to move on with contentment and direction. To be sure, their measure of discomfort is the motivation to move and to grow, which does carry with it its own source of happiness.  </P>
<P>One's aspirations become apparent in those few moments, when the pressure lets up, the holiday, the vacation, the Sunday morning.  If at those moments we find ourselves simply moving along pushed only by inertia, then we may have lost something along the way and our standards may indeed have slipped.  However, if when those moments roll around, even if only infrequently, we jump at he opportunity to open a <I>sefer </I>or catch a <I>minyan</I> or visit an aunt, then indeed our schedules have not altered our priorities, and can feel that we will be transmitting our ideals to another generation. </P>
<P>Perhaps the <I>medrash, </I>that <I>Rashi</I> cited, conjures up the image of a family tRaveling with the uncircumcised baby in tow, taking every step with heavy anxiety, wondering at once when they will see their brethren in <I>Mitzrayim</I> and when they will welcome their son into the covenant of <I>Avrohom</I>.  Those parents, be it on the way, even at an inn, would be found sharpening a rock long before unpacking their bags.  <I>Hashem </I>demanded that the one to be entrusted to teach Torah, its practice and its preciousness, must be entirely consumed by being in a situation that came short of his own expectations. This, it would seem, is the standard set for us, to be ever mindful of our aspirations, seize the moments in which we can realize them, and even find happiness in the knowledge that these moments can be the context for all else that transpires.</P>

<P>It certainly was a rare moment in the annals of fund raising when if 
not for the intervention of <I>Hashem </I>Himself, <I>Moshe </I>would 
have refused quite a substantial donation.  In response to <I>Moshe</I>'s 
request to bring <I>Mishkan </I>construction materials from their homes, 
many women did just that and enthusiastically removed the mirrors off their 
walls. Nevertheless <I>Moshe </I>could not find room within the Mishkan 
the place where <I>Hashem</I>'s presence is to be palpable, for that 
which serves human narcissism and vanity?  </P>
<P></P>
<P>In order to relate to <I>Moshe </I>that these mirrors were in fact 
different, <I>Hashem </I>revealed to <I>Moshe </I>their history 
and the story they would tell to later generations.  Indeed these mirrors 
would forever be seen as responsible for the very generations to whom they 
would talk.  The mirrors would take us back to  Egypt, to a time when our 
spirits were broken and we did not dare dream of ever arising above the 
severe and daily pain of oppression.   At that time Jewish men caved in 
and decided against bringing any more children into the horrors of their 
slavery.  Jewish women, however, would not succumb and coupling the mirrors 
with female prowess, they overcame their husbands' despair and brought 
about a new generation that would participate in <I>Har Sinai</I> and 
the entry into the <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>.  Surely these mirrors did 
not reflect self absorption, but unwavering faith in <I>Hashem</I>'s 
word and uncompromising commitment to His direction.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Furthermore the <I>Meshech Chochma</I> submits that accepting the 
mirrors did not simply validate or reward the actions of our blessed matriarchs, 
rather it served to incorporate their story into the <I>Mikdash</I> 
 <I>Rav Meir Simcha</I> comes to this conclusion upon noting, as only 
he could, that the <I>Torah </I>mentions the purpose of the <I>kiyor 
</I>twice and omits it in a third context.  In <I>parshas Ki Sisa</I> 
(30,18) <I>Moshe </I>is told to construct and place the "<I>kiyor lerochtozo
</I>" - a cistern that would contain the water to be used in the washing 
of the hands and feet of the <I>kohanim </I>as they entered to do their 
service in <I>Mikdash</I>  Again in (40,30) Moshe places the "kiyor 
lerochtzo" in front of the <I>Mishkan</I>  However in <I>parshas Vayakhel 
</I>(38,8) we read that "And he made the <I>kiyor</I> of brass 
and its base of brass out of the mirrors of the women who came in large 
crowds to the opening of the <I>ohel moed</I>",omitting any mention 
of "lerochtozo" - for the purposes of washing.  <I> Rav Meir Simcha </I>thus 
posits that incorporating the mirrors into the <I>kiyor</I> expanded 
its purpose.  It was no longer a simple container storing water and making 
it available to prepare a <I>kohen</I> for service.  Rather it reminded 
people of hope borne through pain and despair and would forever encourage 
those who viewed it to follow the example of one's forebearers. </P>
<P></P>
<P>It has been noted that the message is directed towards the couple whose 
deep distrust of each other has brought them to be tested by the <I>sotah 
</I>waters which were drawn from the <I>kiyor</I>. It should 
not be hard for us to understand the importance of the mirrors' message 
to that couple.  The family comes to the Mikdash convinced that 
the relationship will never be repaired.  After all they harbor accusations 
of faithlessness and actions which make them credible.  Nevertheless Torah 
insists otherwise.  The couple, should they continue their family, is encouraged 
to share in the optimism that the mirrors represent, to look beyond their 
present painful anguish and attempt to envision what kind of future may 
be available to them. </P>
<P></P>
<P>It would seem to me that these mirrors standing in front of <I>Opel 
moed </I>serve to remind everyone of the hope that we must harness 
even as the hiddeness of <I>Hashem </I>challenges our <I>emunah </I>and 
thrusts great ambiguity over our future.  Would it be possible to bring 
a sacrifice to effect raproshmenet or have the strength to plead on behalf 
of oneself and family without  taking strength from the relationship to 
which one looks forward and the redemption that can come "<I>ceheref ayin</i>" 
- as the blink of an eye.  May we all merit to see it soon.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finding herself in what seemed to her as a loveless marriage, Leah hopes to capture her husband's heart as she delivers to him the baby boys that would ultimately establish his legacy. Indeed the names of Leah's first children chronicle a relationship that, in her perception, slowly grew from hate to begrudging companionship.  With her first born, Reuven, she marked that Hashem had seen (<I>ro'oh</I>) her suffering, "and now my husband would love me".  Unfortunately with the next baby, Shimon, she speaks pessimistically as she remarks that Hashem has heard (<I>shoma</I>) that she is hated and perhaps, merely as consolation, granted her another son. However with the birth of Levi, Leah is now surprisingly convinced that "now Ya'akov will accompany (<I>yilaveh</I>) me as I have given birth for him three sons". </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why does Levi's birth nurture this renewed optimism?  Explains Rashi, that blessed with prophecy Leah foresaw a family of four wives and twelve sons and she figured Ya'akov would do the math.  She clearly had been privileged to bear her share and she is quite sure that Ya'akov will finally be fully accepting of her.  I remember my Rebbe HaRav Shimon Romm tz"l vividly portraying the comment of some Ravs that is less generous.  They suggested that with three infants, Leah's arms, already carrying Reuven and Shimon, will need Ya'akov's help and he will no doubt leave Rachel's side to accompany her.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The precise interpretation of the source of Leah's joy not withstanding, it is clear that the arrival of Levi finally convinces Leah that she will enjoy Ya'akov's support in an unprecedented fashion. It is for this reason, opines HaRav Chaim Shmuelevitz tz"l, the <I>rosh yeshiva</I> of the Mir in Yerushalyim till his passing in the seventies, that Levi is destined for eternal distinction.  After all, we find that already in Mitzrayim, long before their noted dedication throughout the golden calf episode, that they had been set apart and freed from working.  This is often noted as Moshe's ticket to the liberty he enjoyed to come and go.  It seems that they were accorded the respect of clergy, a position that they would earn in the years to come.  So great is the feat of bringing greater tranquility to a home, even if done inadvertently and effortlessly, that through it Levi merited a unique position in our nation.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interestingly in our parsha as well, the birth of Yosef is greeted by Rachel with a not so dissimilar reaction to that of Leah at Levi's birth.  At first, Rachel, upon absorbing the news of Yosef's birth, comments "Now Hashem has ended my shame".  Presumably she felt inadequate for so many years and now she can take her place among Ya'akov's fertile wives.    Nevertheless, Rashi quotes a medrash explaining that Rachel was focused on the shame she had felt when she would shoulder the blame for the daily mishaps that are a part of every home.  Now finally, when the dishes dropped and the milk spilled there would Yosef by her side and she could point the finger at him!!  What a strange response from a women who finally gives birth after suffering infertility for so long in the most trying circumstances.  Is it imaginable that after so many years of pining for a child that she would allow the moment for which she had dreamt fizzle into focus on the mundane.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suggests HaRav Shmuelevittz that our surprise is that of those who just don't get it; of a person who does not get how hurtful the small daily barbs really are and they over time can wear down the strongest of mates.  Only those who appreciate how important tranquility at home is can understand that with all that must have been going through Rachel's mind, the additional peace at home impressed her most. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the manner in which the Torah describes the Yaakov-Leah-Rachel triangle reveals an instructive insight into <I>shalom bayis</I>.  Clearly Leah felt that she was hated as her remark in naming Shimon indicates.  Hashem concurred (29,31), "And Hashem saw that Leah was hated and she opened up her womb."  Yet the preceding <I>pasuk</I> does state that Ya'akov loved Rachel more than Leah, inferring that Leah was not number one but she was not at all hated.  How do we reconcile these descriptions?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ramban quoting the Radak points out that marriage differs from other relationships.  Whereas other relationships can weather orbits of varying strengths and closeness, marriage is a center or nothing matter.  Either spouses are central to each other or they will feel distanced.  Would Leah be a friend she certainly would have felt the love Ya'akov poured over her, but as one who aspires to be the mainstay of one's home she deservedly belongs to be the point about which all life revolves.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[<I>Parshas Noach</I>: A New Creation?]]></title>

<P>In the aftermath of the <I>mabul</I> that refashioned the world, the Torah (<I>Bereshis</I> 9:1) records that Hashem blessed Noah and his children in a manner that is reminiscent of his original charge to man: " <I>peru u-revu u-milu et ha-aretz</I>". In fact, the Radak (9:1) is troubled by the apparent repetition, and is forced to conclude that the <I>mabul</I> was not merely a catastrophic historical event, but constituted a second act of creation, as it left the world again in a state <I>of "tohu va-vohu</I>". Hence, the need to reiterate the initial <I>berakhah</I>. Notwithstanding this radical conclusion, Radak (9:2) views this <I>berakhah</I> and the <I>pesukim</I> that follow it as a reaffirmation of the basic principles established at the time of the original creation that govern man's conduct, regulate his interaction with the world around him, and define his very purpose. Even the most salient change brought about by the <I>mabul</I>, the license for man to eat meat (9:3), is not perceived by the Radak as a fundamental shift in the natural order. He (9:4) asserts that while man was prevented from consuming meat until Noah invested effort in securing the future of animal life, the original scheme of creation already incorporated the notion that animals would serve man both in his work and as a source of food. </P>
<P>An examination of these <I>pesukim</I>, however, reveals that another perspective is possible. The strong parallels between the aftermath of the <I>mabul</I> and the creation of the world also serve to accent the subtle differences in the Torah's formulation of the new series of <I>berakhot</I> and commandments. </P>
<P>In <I>Bereshis</I> (1:26), when man's creation is contemplated, he is presented with a challenge and charge not only to procreate and populate the world, but to master his environment and assert his authority in the hierarchy of living things<I>- "ve-yirdu be-degat ha-yam u-beof ha-shamayim u-bekol remes haromes al ha-aretz</I>". Upon man's actual creation, Hashem bestows a <I>berakhah</I> upon him which again emphasizes his intended mastery(1:28):"<I>peru u-revu u-milu et ha-aretz ve-kivshuhah, u-redu be-degat ha-yam u-beof hashamayim u-bekol hayah ha-romeset al ha-aretz</I>". This <I>berakah</I> contrasts sharply with that given to the birds and fish (1:22)- <I>" peru u-revu u-milu et ha-mayim ba-yamim ve-haof yirev ba-aretz</I>"- which focuses exclusively on populating their respective environments. It is noteworthy, that the <I>pesukim</I> that immediately follow the articulation of man's destiny (1:29-30) are devoted to man's and animals' diet. Perhaps this indicates that the different roles and respective destinies in the creation hierarchy are reflected in this issue. The Ramban and other <I>mefarshim</I> (1:29. see, also, Rashi, Ibn Ezra etc.) conclude from a close reading of the text that not only could man not eat meat, but that the Torah also intended to differentiate between the vegetarian diets of man and animal. Man was to <I>consume "esev zorea zera</I>" and "<I>eitz asher bo peri eitz zorea zera</I>" products, while animals were restricted to "<I>kol yerek esev</I>". </P>
<P>After the <I>mabul</I>, man's aspirations appear to have been significantly scaled back. Here, too, his destiny is twice addressed. While the first formulation is certainly just a <I>berakah</I>, it is possible that the second expression is intended as a command. [ Rashi and Ramban (9:7) briefly address the issue of the relationship between these two <I>pesukim</I> and the <I>pesukim</I> in <I>Bereshis</I>.] In any event, even if both components register in the post-<I>mabul</I> era, the change in order relative to the <I>Bereishis</I> account is intriguing. Of greater significance is the nature and scope of the <I>berakhah</I>/challenge/<I>zivui</I>. Man's post-<I>mabul</I> agenda does not include any reference to mastery of his environment or the hierarchy of created beings. Indeed, Noah's <I>berakhah/zivui</I> really parallels the initial <I>berakhah</I> to the birds and fish, articulated in <I>Bereishis</I>! Noah is given instructions regarding man's interaction with other species, but these, too, reflect a change at least in tone. The focus is no longer on the ambition of conquest and domination, but on a mechanism for survival and self-defense- <I>" u-morakhem ve-hitkhem yihiyeh al kol hayat ha-aretz ve'al kol of ha-shamayim...</I>" Perhaps for this reason, the initial focus is on wild animals, as they pose the greatest security threat. The world of the sea, which constitutes a completely distinct domain and poses no real hazard if man remains in his own environment is treated differently in this context- "<I>u-bekol degai ha-yam be-yedkhem nitanu."</I> This order and emphasis contrasts sharply with the <I>Bereishis</I> parallel (1:26,28) in which the more distant and challenging domains- the sea and air- are underscored first. </P>
<P>Moreover, the Ramban(9:5) and others perceive that the post-<I>mabul</I> allowance to consume meat constitutes a fundamental change in man's very nature, and perhaps in the whole dynamic of creature interaction. The Ramban argues that it was necessary to reiterate the prohibition against murder in this context precisely because significant changes had occurred. The Abudraham explains that the proper <I>berakah</I> for eating meat is <I>birkhat she-hakol</I> and <I>not "boreih hayat ha-aretz</I>" precisely because the original creation scheme did not entail the consumption of animals. Evidently, a significant transformation took place in Noah's time. The link between destiny and diet in both contexts certainly points to a broad refashioning of the world order in the aftermath of the <I>mabul</I>. </P>
<P>While some <I>mefarshim</I> (Akedat Yitzhak) see this watershed transition as an evolution in man's status, a symbol of his progress in distancing himself from the animal kingdom, justifying the eating of meat, the cumulative evidence makes a compelling case for the view that this second creation reflects man's limitations and Hashem's disappointment. Coming on the heals of the need for such a radical restructuring and the Divine assessment- (8:21<I>)" ki yezer lev ha-adam ra mi-neuRav</I>"-, it is likely that the new world order constituted a concession to man's inability to sufficiently distinguish himself from the rest of creation. According to Abarbanel, he was permitted meat as a concession to ensure his survival. According to other perspectives, man's lower ambitions and aspirations no longer justified such dietary restrictions. The world was, indeed, reconstituted, but on a different basis. The need to reiterate the theme of <I>zelem elokim</I> and the prohibitions against murder in this context of lowered expectations is paramount. </P>
<P>This perspective is consistent with the view that we have developed elsewhere (TorahWeb, <I>parshas</I> Noah, <a href="http://www.torahweb.org/torah/1999/parsha/rros_noach.html">5760</a>,
<A href="http://www.torahweb.org/torah/2000/parsha/rros_noach2000.html">5761</a>) according to which Noah, himself, especially in contrast to both Avraham and Moshe, personifies the values of compromise and survival, not those of spiritual excellence and idealism. His association with the 7 Noachide commands, and especially his personal link with every <I>min hachai</I>, which simultaneously accents the allowance of meat and its restriction, contrast dramatically with the loftier spiritual idealism embodied by <I>taryag mizvot</I> and the total corpus of Torah and <I>halakhah</I>. </P>
<P>The impact of the <I>mabul</I> on human nature and world order may have been profound. However, the ideal challenges presented to Adam continue to inspire mankind in general, and especially A<I>m Yisrael</I>. Notwithstanding the second act of creation following the "<I>tohu vavohoo</I>" after the <I>mabul</I>, it is the initial creation of <I>Bereishis</I> that we continue to commemorate on Rosh Hashanah ("<I>hayom harat olam</I>") and every <I>Shabbat</I>. As the Ramban notes the fact that we designate days of the week by their distance from <I>Shabbat</I> conveys a powerful message that the entire week revolves around <I>Shabbat</I>. In this way, Jews continue to underscore their ideal commitment to Hashem in the post-<I>mabul</I> world. </P>

<P>In <I>Parshat Vayigash</I>, the Torah dramatically records how Yakkov received the startling news that Yosef had survived and ascended to the leadership of Egypt. At first, Yaakov, told of the facts alone, was skeptical- "<I>va-yafeg libo ki lo heemin lahem</I>"(45:26). However, upon further elaboration that included "<I>divrei Yosef asher diber aleihem</I>", as well as viewing the <I>"agalot asher shalah Yosef laseit oto</I>"(45:27), Yaakov became convinced that the information was authentic. His response reflects a spiritual revival - "<I>va-techi ruach Yaakov avihem</I>". Moreover, the Torah registers a return of Yaakov to his "Yisrael" persona -<I> "Vayomer Yisrael Rav od Yosef beni chay</I>"(45:28)- which had apparently been suppressed during almost the entire period during which he had mistakenly mourned for Yosef. [The lone exception, which reinforces this insight, is found in the verse that conveys Yaakov's heroic determination to overcome his personal misgivings about separating from Binyamin when faced with the prospect that his entire family, and by extension, the legacy of all "<I>benei yisrael</I>", would be jeopardized (43:11).]. Chazal (Rashi, 45:27) suggest that Yaakov's total change of heart resulted from a signal sent by Yosef through the "<I>agalot</I>", signifying the last <I>halachic</I> topic that the father and son had studied together, <I>eglah arufah</I>. Considering the radical transformation accomplished by Yosef's method of communication, it behooves us to try to better understand the significance of the message from son to father. </P>
<P>On a basic level, it is possible that the very fact that the pragmatic and powerful ruler of Egypt still identified himself as the young, idealistic dreamer-child who had studied with his father duly impressed Yaakov. That Yosef still communicated with and through Torah categories after having been absent from the environment of Yaakov's home for so long, was even more striking. Yaakov could not have assumed until this communication that his own impact upon his favorite son had endured. By accenting the sense of continuity with the past notwithstanding the tremendous changes that had befallen him, Yosef was able to convey something of the overriding sense of "<I>demut deyukno shel abba</I>" (the impact of his father's image) that had sustained him throughout his exile from his family (Rashi, 39:11). In the episode in which he was tempted by the wife of Potiphar, Yosef was fortified by his father's image not only in his ability to face the challenge but also in his ability to place the issues in proper perspective by accenting the interface between <I>bein adam lamakom</I> and <I>bein adam la-haveiro</I> elements: <I>"eineno gadol babayit hazeh mimeni...vehatati le-Elokim</I>." Later, Yosef again establishes his unequivocal religious commitment: "<I>zot asu ve-cheyu, et ha-Elokim ani yarei</I>"(42:18) </P>
<P>Perhaps Yosef's subtle message to his father was even more specific and profound. The theme of <I>eglah arufah</I> projects an idealistic theme that projects the concept of brotherhood and an extraordinary commitment to collective responsibility among Jews. When an anonymous body is discovered, the elders are obligated to <I>declare "yadeinu lo shafchu ha-dam ha-zeh, ve-eineinu lo rau</I>".(Devarim 21:7) Chazal (Sotah 45b) explain that although the elders are certainly not direct suspects in the crime, they are also not necessarily completely beyond reproach in a more indirect sense, as they might have provided shelter or sustenance that might have prevented the victim from becoming a vulnerable target. It is reasonable to assume that Chazal also intended to impose responsibility on the religious leadership for the total moral and spiritual climate that prevails in their sphere of influence, and that may have indirectly contributed to the crime. </P>
<P>Yosef had been rebuked by Yaakov for the apparently insensitive way in which he had conveyed his dreams to his brothers (Bereishit 37:10). He had been blamed, at least partially, for the poisoned atmosphere between them (Rashi, 37:10). It may have been no coincidence that, according to Chazal, the last <I>halachic</I> topic that he studied with his father focused on the extraordinary obligation of brotherhood that defined moral responsibility in much broader and ambitious terms. He was then sent to seek out and reconcile with his brothers<I>- "lech na reeh et shelom achechah...et achai anochi mevakesh</I>"(37:14,16), undoubtedly also with the goal of implementing this ideal <I>halachic</I> vision. In response, Yosef was subject to brutal and vicious treatment by the brothers with whom he sought to reconcile. Whatever their self-justification, their unacceptable tactics constituted a "<I>bechiyah le-dorot</I>", reflecting the polar opposite of the <I>eglah arufah</I> theme. Was it possible that Yosef, having experienced all of this in the context of "<I>et achai anochi mevakesh</I>", could still be faithful, even sensitive to the extraordinary values of empathy and responsibility exemplified by the theme of <I>eglah arufah</I>? </P>
<P>According to Chazal, Yosef was, indeed, held to an exalted standard of empathy. The midrash notes the link between the description of Yosef as "<I>yefeh toar ve-yefeh mareh</I>"(39:6, Rashi) and the episode of the wife of Potiphar- " <I>va-yehi achar ha-devarim ha-eileh</I>..."(39:7). The suggestion is advanced that because Yosef momentarily allowed himself the luxury of focusing on himself and on his own good turn of fortune, losing sight of his father's suffering, he brought upon himself further challenges and misfortune. This perspective is all the more remarkable considering that Yakkov's despair was merely a byproduct of Yosef's victimization. </P>
<P>This extraordinary standard was ultimately evident in his actual encounter with his brothers. "<I>Vayaker Yosef et echav ve-hem lo hikiruhu</I>"(42:8). Rashi cites the midrash on this verse that indicates that he was able to relate to them with compassion when he exercised power over them notwithstanding the fact that they had gratuitously behaved viciously to him when they were in control. </P>
<P>Chazal argue that Yosef manipulated his brothers specifically so that they would come to grips with the enormity of their betrayal and so that they would become cognizant of this concept of empathy and responsibility. Thus, they were ultimately motivated to declare: <I>"ashemim anachnu...rainu tsarat nafsho be-hitchaneno eileinu ve-lo shamanu.</I>"(42:21) Ramban and other commentators explain that the expression "<I>asheimim</I>" and the broader focus on their insensitivity reflects their guilt about their inhumane tactics beyond even their decision to treat Yosef as a <I>rodef</I>. </P>
<P>When Yehudah was able to forcefully articulate the theme of <I>arevut</I> and express total empathy with his father(44:31-34)-"<I>ki avdechah aRav et hanaar mei-im avi...ki eich aaleh el avi...pen ereh ba-ra asher yimatsei et avi...</I> "- the process that Yosef had put into place had come to fruition. </P>
<P>When the reunion between the brothers finally takes place, Yosef is overcome with emotion that flows from his sense of brotherhood and empathy (45:1-4). He proceeds to protect his brothers from any hint of embarrassment, notwithstanding their previous attitude toward him and although he has little evidence that they will reciprocate his sensitivity or responsibility (Rashi, 45:1). </P>
<P>When he sends them to Yaakov, he admonishes them: "<I>al tirgazu ba-derech</I>"(45:24), which according to one view in Chazal (which Rashi also cites) is designed to secure the atmosphere between them by ensuring that they will not engage in recriminations regarding their crime against Yosef. Even in this context, Yosef is ever sensitive that the environment be conducive to harmony and brotherhood. </P>
<P>The message of <I>eglah arufah</I> allowed Yaakov to overcome his skepticism not only regarding Yosef's physical survival, but with respect to his spiritual persona, as well. The hint to their last study session conveyed to Yaakov that the memory of that lesson had endured and continued to impact upon the adult Yosef notwithstanding all of the trauma and adversity that he had undoubtedly experienced and encountered. Apparently the naive, dreaming idealist torn from his family had not evolved into merely a seasoned and hardened political survivor capable of expert manipulation (as exercised on his brothers previously). Yosef had in fact, despite his ordeal and perhaps also because of his ordeal, evolved into an extraordinarily idealistic religious personality fully committed to the teachings of <I>eglah arufah</I>. Yaakov was spiritually uplifted by this realization- "<I>vatechi ruach Yaakov</I>". Of even greater significance, this discovery returned "Yisrael" to <I>Klal Yisrael</I>. This was only fitting as these values truely embody the unique religious ambition of <I>Klal Yisrael</I>. </P>
<P>With a sense of greater confidence that the basic, yet ambitious themes embodied by <I>eglah arufah</I> could thrive even outside of <I>eretz yisrael</I> with the proper kind of commitment and education (though the actual institution of <I>eglah arufah</I> is restricted to the ideal setting of <I>eretz yisrael</I>. see Rambam, Hil. Rotseach 10:1), Yaakov was better able to acquiesce to the Divine plan and to proceed to Egypt. The initial plan of a visit- "<I>eilchah ve-erenu be-terem amut</I>"(45:28), was replaced by a longer blueprint that was sanctioned by Hashem but that invoked Yosef's role: "<I>anochi eireid imchah mizraymah ve-anochi aalechah gam aloh ve-Yosef yashit yado al einechah</I>" (46:4). Yaakov undertakes the trip, a new and difficult odyssey for <I>Klal Yisrael</I>, precisely by mounting the physical symbols of Yosef's critical self-<I>revelation "bagalot asher shalach Paroh lasait oto</I>". </P>

<P>The centerpiece of <I>Parshat Yitro</I> is the <I>Asseret ha-Dibrot</I>. The special significance of these ten themes, the content of the direct Divine Revelation, is axiomatic. The unique stature of the <I>Asseret ha-Dibrot</I> is further highlighted by the perspective articulated by R. Saadiah Gaon, Ramban and others who argue that these ten commandments succinctly encapsulate the totality of the 613 <I>mitzvot</I>! This view might also justify the controversial custom to stand during the reading of this section. Rambam (Teshuvot, no. 60) vehemently opposed this practice, arguing that it implied an unacceptable axiological hierarchy in the text or <I>mitzvot</I> of the Torah. If the <I>Asseret ha-Dibrot</I> embody the totality of the <I>mitzvot</I>, rising for its recitation is hardly problematic. (For another approach to this issue, see Mesorah I, 17-18 ) </P>
<P>At first glance, however, the fact that this crucial series of <I>mitzvot</I> concludes with the prohibition of <I>Lo Tachmod</I> is puzzling. One would anticipate that a list of this magnitude would begin with a <I>mitzvah</I> that would set the tone for the entire unit, and culminate with a theme that powerfully conveys the spiritually ambitious agenda of Torah life. The inaugural <I>mitzvah</I> fits this expectation, as it focuses on belief in Hashem, the "foundation of foundations (<I>yesod ha-yesodot</I>"- Rambam, Hil. Yesodei Ha-Torah 1:1). Indeed, Ramban (Sefer Ha-Mizvot, Aseh 1) explains that <I>Behag</I> omitted this principle from the list of 613 <I>mitzvot</I> because it transcends the status of a <I>mitzvah</I>, as it is the foundation of all <I>mitzvot</I>. The conclusion of <I>Lo Tachmod</I>, on the other hand, does not seem to conform with the anticipated pattern. The prohibition against coveting one's neighbors belongings, focusing also on homes, slaves, various animals, and finally "<I>kol asher le-reiechah</I>" hardly seems inspirational or climactic. </P>
<P>There are other difficulties associated with this final <I>dibrah</I>. The term "<I>chimud</I>", as Ibn Ezra (Devarim 5:17) notes, is ambiguous. In some contexts, it signifies the action of theft, while in other circumstances it refers to thought alone. Why would the Torah utilize such confusing terminology in such a crucial context? The relationship between <I>Lo Tachmod</I> and robbery is examined by Ramban, R. Behai and other commentators. Although they suggest that <I>Lo Tachmod</I> represents <I>gezel</I> in the <I>Asseret ha-Dibrot</I>, they do not fully explain why this more ambiguous concept is preferable to the more concrete <I>gezel</I>! </P>
<P>However, upon further examination, we can perhaps appreciate more fully the Torah's choice, and the symmetry between the beginning and end of this transcendent list of <I>mitzvot</I>. Both the first and concluding <I>mitzvot</I> of the <I>Asseret ha-Dibrot</I> engender significant discussion among the commentators inasmuch as each is inherently an attitudinal demand, constituting legislation in the realm of emotions/belief. Herein precisely lies the unique ambition of the Torah as a value system that seeks to transform and define the human personality. The Torah insists that man's perspective can and must be shaped by the spiritual-<I>halachic</I> values that give life its purpose. This is true not only with respect to belief in Hashem, without which life would cease to have meaning, but is also true with regard to the equally indispensable value of a proper approach to material goods. </P>
<P>The Torah intentionally bypasses "<I>gezel</I>" for "<I>chimud</I>" precisely because the term "<I>chimud</I>" refers also to planning for or obsessing about attaining someone else's property. There is much evidence to indicate that the improper focus upon another's property constitutes the root of this prohibition even according to those authorities who demand that the planning be implemented, as well. Rambam (Hil. Gezeilah 1:9), for example, insists that this violation cannot occur without the attainment of the object in question, yet he characterizes the prohibition as one lacking in action - "<I>lav she-ein bo masseh</I>"- with respect to the absence of <I>malkot</I>! (See Raavad's gloss on this point!) R. Yonah and Ibn Ezra, in their Torah commentaries, explain that this prohibition seeks to inculcate the <I>halachic</I> approach to the material world by projecting the ideal of "<I>sameach be-chelko</I>" (satisfaction with one's material lot in life), thereby also guaranteeing mutual respect and limiting friction between individuals. Ramban (Kedoshim) posits that <I>Lo Tachmod</I> is the analogue to the obligation to love one's neighbor <I>("ve-ahavta le-reiachah ka-mochah</I>"), perceived by <I>Chazal</I> as a major tenet (<I>kelal gadol</I>) of the Torah. The fact that such apparently mundane items as slaves, animals and "<I>kol asher le-reiechah</I>" round out the list of <I>Lo Tachmod</I> objects actually reinforces the ambition and pervasiveness of this ideal. </P>
<P>Ibn Ezra (Shemot 20:13) explains that one can condition his thoughts and desires in accordance with <I>halachic</I> principles and ideals as long as one perceives <I>halachic</I> norms as absolute values. He argues that one who is truly committed to Torah observance cannot conceive of violating its principles any more than a simple commoner can realistically dream of marrying into the royal family. Just as a sane individual does not seriously entertain the possibility that he will sprout wings and ascend to the heavens, a committed <I>halachic</I> observer is incapable of becoming seriously obsessed with the inappropriate attainment of his fellow's belonging. Thus, <I>Lo Tachmod</I> constitutes an extraordinarily ambitious agenda that is rooted in a pervasive commitment to the notion of a "<I> halachic</I> reality". </P>
<P>R. Samson Raphael Hirsch notes that while the first group of the <I>Asseret ha-Dibrot</I> begins with theological commitment and then shifts to obligations of actions, the second half of the <I>Dibrot</I> commence with a focus on actions but conclude with values that are critical to an ideological commitment. Values and a commitment to principle is the foundation of the Torah, but the Torah's special approach to life demands that these be concretized in activities and norms. At the same time, the focus on actions and norms would be insufficient if it did not, in turn, produce and generate a more intricate <I>halachic</I> value system to govern the spiritual life of the committed Torah Jew. The process that begins with a commitment to faith- "<I>Anochi Hashem Elokechah</I>"- culminates with the profound impact of <I>halachic</I> reality manifested in <I>Lo Tachmod</I>, as the reciprocal interaction of thought and deed shape and define the <I>halachic</I> personality. Properly understood, <I>Lo Tachmod</I> is indeed the appropriate culmination and climax for the ambitious program of <I>avodat Hashem</I> outlined in the <I>Asseret ha-Dibrot</I> and elaborated in <I>Taryag Mizvot</I>. </P>

<P>The opening <I>parshios</I> of <I>Sefer Shmos</I> provide keen insight into the significance of <I>hakoras hatov</I>, thankfulness and appreciation. The Torah emphasizes the failure of Paroh to recognize the goodness of Yosef Hatzaddik, "<I>Vayakam melech chadash al mitzrayim asher lo yadah es yosef."</P>
</I><P>Later, the very same Paroh would deny Hashem. The <I>medrash</I> links these two acts of denial, teaching us that one who fails to recognize and appreciate the kindness and graciousness of others will ultimately deny the goodness of Hashem.</P>
<P>Similarly, the Chinuch (<I>Mitzvah </I>33) emphasizes <I>hakoras hatov</I> as the foundation of the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>kibbud av voem</I>. The Chinuch further connects honoring one's parents with appreciating Hakadosh Baruch Hu. "<I>Ukesheyikba zos hamitzva benafsho yaaleh mimenahlehakir tovas Hakel Baruch Hu.</I>"</P>
<P>The Medrash Rabbah (<I>Perek 10</I>) explains that the proper expression of gratitude and thankfulness required that the first three <I>makos </I>be performed by Aharon instead of Moshe Rabbeinu. Moshe, who had been saved by water and dirt was unable to actively participate in these plagues.</P>
<P>How are we to understand this sense of <I>hakoras hatov</I>? Surely, the water and dirt did not go out of their way to aid Moshe Rabbeinu. Inanimate objects do not need, and cannot appreciate our gratitude.</P>
<P>We often measure our obligation of <I>hakoras hatov</I> from the perspective of the one who performed the act of <I>chessed</I>. We ask ourselves, how far did he go out of his way to help me? Will he appreciate my thankfulness? </P>
<P>The inability of Moshe Rabbeinu to participate in the initial <I>makos</I>&nbsp;teaches us that we must also view <I>hakoras hatov</I> from the viewpoint of the beneficiary. The mere fact that Moshe Rabbeinu benefitted from the water and dirt elicited an overwhelming sense of gratitude.</P>
<P>In this sense, <I>Gemora Brachos</I> (58b) contrasts the <I>Oreach Tov</I> and the <I>Oreach Ra</I>. Wheras the ungrateful guest minimizes his need to express gratitude, claiming, "<I>kol toreach shetorach baal habayis zeh, lo tarach elah bishvil ishto uvanav," </I>that the <I>baal habayis</I> exerted little additional effort on the guests behalf, the appreciative guest views any benefit that he received as though it was exclusively for him. </P>
<P>The Gra explains that each of us is an <I>oreach</I> in this world which Hashem created. One could selfishly feel that Hashem created little exclusively for him. How difficult was it for Hashem to provide me with a measure of good. True <I>hakoras hatov, </I>however, demands that each of us, as an <I>oreach tov</I>, view all <I>chasdei</I>  Hashem as though <I>bishvili nivra haolam</I>, they were performed exclusively for me. </P>
<P>If the Torah insists that we acknowledge benefit from water and dirt, how much more so must we be constantly mindful of the gratitude our fellow man and ultimately that of Hakadosh Baruch Hu. </P>

		<content><![CDATA[




<P>At the beginning of <I>Parshas Vayishlach</I>, the Torah recounts the meeting between Yaakov <I>Avinu</I> and Eisav <I>Harasha</I>. The Torah tells us that Yaakov's initial response to the impending meeting was (32:7), "<I>vayira Yaakov meod vayetzer lo</I>", Yaakov experienced great fear and anguish. Under normal circumstances, this reaction would be understandable. However, in last week's <I>parsha</I>, Hashem promised Yaakov, "<I>unshmarticha bechol asher telech</I>" ("I will guard you wherever you go"). How could Yaakov <I>Avinu</I> be so fearful if Hashem had promised him he would emerge victorious? The <I>Gemara</I> in <I>Berachos</I> (4b) tells us that Yaakov was concerned "<I>shema yigrom hacheit</I>", perhaps sin would cause Hashem's promise to be rescinded. </P>
<P>The Rambam, in his introduction to his commentary on the <I>Mishna</I>, points out the following difficulty. Later, the <I>Gemara</I> <I>Berachos</I> (7a) tells us that any promise Hashem makes for that which is good, even if it is conditional, will never be rescinded. Hashem's promise that he would protect Yaakov was one for the good, and therefore could never be retracted; why then was Yaakov fearful that his sins would cancel the promise? The Rambam answers that this comment in the <I>Berachos</I> depends on whether the communication took place between Hashem and a prophet privately or whether the prophecy was meant to be relayed to others. If the prophecy is private, there is no guarantee that Hashem will not retract it. If, however, it is to be relayed to others, it will not be rescinded. As such, Yaakov was justified in his fear - Hashem's communication was to him alone, and could therefore be rescinded.</P>
<P>The Meshech Chochma in <I>Parshas Vayera</I> points out that Avraham and Sara had seemingly similar reactions to the news that they would soon be blessed with a child. The Torah describes Avraham's reaction as "<I>vayitzchak</I>", and Sara's as "<I>vatitzchak</I>". Why, then was Sara criticized for laughing and Avraham not criticized? The Targum translates the two terms quite differently. Avraham's laughter is translated as "<I>vechadi</I>", he rejoiced. Sara's laughter is translated as "<I>vecheichas</I>", she laughed. The Meshech Chochma suggests that since Hashem told Avraham the news in private, there was no guarantee it would actually happen. However, once he was commanded to tell Sara, this prophecy had the status of a promise that would not be retracted, and hence Sara's laughter was inappropriate.</P>
<P>The Rambam in the seventh of the <I>Shemona Perakim</I> and in the <I>Moreh Nevuchim</I> discusses the concept of <I>nevuah</I> in general, and specifically one who receives it. The Rambam quotes three possible understandings of the qualifications of a <I>navi</I>. The philosophers who do not follow the Torah assume that anyone can receive <I>nevuah</I> if they perfect themselves. This is incorrect.  The general populace assumes that Hashem picks random people to be <I>nevi'im</I>, regardless of their character. This understanding is also incorrect. The correct understanding is that preparation is necessary, but insufficient. Certainly, one cannot receive <I>nevuah</I> without being spiritually fit. However, even once a person has perfected himself, there is no guarantee he will receive <I>nevuah</I>. What does perfection mean? Can a <I>navi</I> never make a mistake in his personal life, lest he lose his <I>nevuah</I>? The Rambam brings several examples of neviim who sinned yet retained their ability to receive prophecy that prove that this is not the case. One of these examples is Yaakov <I>Avinu</I> who received <I>nevuah</I> despite his sin - his trepidation of the encounter with Esav.</P>
<P>There seems to be a contradiction within the Rambam. In the introduction to the commentary on the <I>Mishna</I>, he says that Yaakov <I>Avinu</I> was justified in his fear. Yet here he says that Yaakov <I>Avinu</I> sinned relative to his stature. How can one resolve this contradiction? </P>
<P>Rav Elchanan Wasserman hy"d, in his explanation of <I>aggadeta</I> (5) at the end of his <I>Kovetz Ha'aros</I>, quotes a comment of the Vilna Gaon in Chapter 14 of <I>Mishlei</I>. The Gaon quotes the verse in Tehillim (118:9) "<I>Tov lachasos bahAshem, mivtoach bindivim</I>" ("it is better to trust in Hashem than in nobles"). The Gaon is bothered by the seemingly obvious nature of this verse - of course our <I>bitachon</I> is in Hashem! The Gaon understands the two similar, but distinct, terms used in the verse: <I>bitachon</I> and <I>chisayon</I>. What is the difference between the two, between belief and reliance? <I>Bitachon</I>, says the Gaon, is when someone gives you an absolute promise and you believe that the promise will come true. <I>Chisayon</I> is when you believe something will happen even if there was never any promise to that effect. Placing one's trust in Hashem, even when there is no guarantee He will grant that which one wants, is far superior than placing one's trust in the absolute promises of a human being. Rav Elchanan writes that this is the way to resolve the contradiction within the Rambam. Yaakov <I>Avinu</I> had legitimate cause for concern - his sins could have caused Hashem's promise to be rescinded because the promise was given in private. Nevertheless, even if there was no explicit promise, he should have relied on Hashem. A person must trust in Hashem even without guarantees as to the outcome.</P>
<P>This lesson of Yaakov <I>Avinu</I> serves as a model for our behavior and character. The Meshech Chochma points out that Yaakov <I>Avinu</I> led a life filled with much suffering. The way Hashem appeared to Yaakov was different than the way He appeared to Avraham and Yitzchak; he appeared to Yaakov at night, outside of <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>. Even in the heart of darkness and despair, in the dire straits of <I>galus</I>, one can still experience the presence of the <I>shechina</I>.</P>
<P>The <I>Gemara</I> in <I>Berachos</I> tells us that each forefather instituted a different prayer - Avraham instituted <I>Shacharis</I>, Yitzchak instituted <I>Mincha</I>, and Yaakov instituted <I>Maariv</I>. The <I>tefilla</I> at night was the one instituted by Yaakov, because his life was one of trials, fears, and anguish, yet he still had trust in Hashem.</P>
<P>How can a person experience <I>nevuah</I> even in <I>chutz laaretz</I>? On the verse at the beginning of <I>sefer</I> Yechezkel, "<I>hayo haya d'var Hashem el Yechezkel ben Buzi HaKohen</I>", Rashi, commenting on the double language of "<I>hayo haya</I>", says that although he was now in <I>chutz laaretz</I>, Yechezkel was already a <I>navi</I> when he was in <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>, and therefore could also be a <I>navi</I> in <I>chutz laaretz</I>. One can not initially become a <I>navi</I> in <I>chutz laaretz</I>, but the experience of <I>nevuah</I> in <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> serves to sustain <I>nevuah</I>, even in <I>chutz laaretz</I>.</P>
<P>The Meshech Chochma explains that a person can survive in <I>galus</I> by retaining a connection with the Torah and values of <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>. Yaakov <I>Avinu</I> instituted the <I>tefilla</I> of <I>Maariv</I>, which the <I>Gemara</I> says commemorates the sacrifice of the fats and limbs in the <I>Beis HaMikdash</I>. These are unique in that they can be brought at night, but only if their original sacrifice was brought during the day. This is the experience of <I>galus</I> - one can still experience the <I>shechina</I> if one links oneself to <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>, much like one can bring the fats and limbs if they are linked to a daytime sacrifice.</P>
<P>We now are experiencing, in  a dire way, the darkness of <I>galus</I>, especially in light of the recent events in <I>Eretz Yisrael</I>. May our <I>bitachon</I> and <I>chisayon</I> in Hashem serve as our source of strength as we await the <I>geula sheleima bimeheira biyameinu</I>.</P>

<P>The uniqueness of Moshe Rabbeinu's vision is described, "<I>Peh el peh adaber bo u'mareh v'lo b'chidos,</I>" (Bamidbar 12:8) ("Mouth to mouth I speak to him, in a clear vision and not in riddles"), while in reference to other prophets we are told, "<I>Bamarra eilav esvada bachalom adaber bo,</I>" (12:6) ("See only in reflections or in dreams").</P>
<P>Rav Chaim Volozhin (Ruach Chaim 1:1) links this distinction to Moshe's unique humility, "<I>V'haish Moshe anav m'od mikol adam</I>" - "And the man Moshe was more modest than any other person," (Bamidbar 12:3). This quality of self-negation enabled him to see directly and clearly (Yevamos 49b), to the point that Hashem spoke <U>through</U> him ("<I>bo</I>" Bamidbar 12:8), not just to him.</P>
<P>Moshe's siblings mistakenly thought that other prophets were also on this level ("<I>gam banu </I>12:2) but in reality they only communicated with Hashem via mirrors, dreams and riddles. Their sense of self, however small, distorted the picture that they saw through the lens of their personal bias. Only Moshe, who had absolutely no sense of self, and was the uniquely humble servant of Hashem, saw clearly and directly in a wakened state.</P>
<P>Therefore, only Moshe could receive the Torah and say <U>this</U> is what Hashem commanded. All other prophets merely approximated, i.e. "So said Hashem," (Rashi 30:2). Only Moshe received the Torah at Sinai in its entirety. Thereafter the Torah was given to Yehoshua, elders, prophets, and sages but no recipient captured it in its entirety (Avos 1:1).</P>
<P>Moshe's humility exceeded that of Avraham (Chulin 89a). Avraham said, "<I>v'anochi affar v'eiffer</I>" -"and I am dust and ash" (Braishis 18:27), whereas Moshe said "I am nothing" (see Shmos 16:8 - "<I>v'nachnu ma</I>" - "who are we", referring to himself and Aharon).</P>
<P>When Hashem called, "Avraham, Avraham" (Braishis 2:11), in the Torah a line separates between the two words. The call "Moshe Moshe" (Shmos 3:4) has no such separation (Shmos Rabba 2:6). The line signifies a gap between the soul and the reality which the body creates. Only Moshe, who negated his body, i.e. his sense of self, completely, reached his full potential, so that the Divine presence would speak, as it were, through his throat.</P>
<P>This lofty description of the greatest prophet carries an important lesson for all people in all times. Our understanding of Torah is affected by who we are. In many cases, a personal agenda, explicit or implicit, leads to a distorted interpretation of Torah laws and values. Even a sincere effort to comprehend and apply <I>halachah</I> is affected by every person's tendency to see matters through his own "glasses".</P>
<P>It is nearly impossible to totally remove personal bias in <I>halachic</I> analysis and decision. Yet this is the challenge imposed upon all recipients of <I>Toras Moshe</I>. If we cannot be "<I>mikabel</I>" completely, we must attempt to adhere to the <I>mesorah</I> described in the first <I>mishna</I> of <I>Pirkei Avos</I>.</P>
<P>It is noteworthy that the three things recorded in that <I>mishna</I> in Avos - be deliberate in judgement, develop many disciples, and make a fence for the Torah - relate to the theme of humility which is the very essence of <I>mesorah</I>.  An arrogant person makes snap judgements, without consultation, and "pushes the envelope" to the limit. A humble person, cognizant of human frailty, is more deliberate, consults with peers and students, and allows for a margin of error.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, this conservative approach is attacked by promoters of various agendas, often with inappropriate self-assuredness. Even sincere Torah Jews sometimes fail to appreciate the <I>mishna</I>'s long view, and criticize rabbonim who resist the <I>zeitgeist</I>.</P>
<P>Ironically, in Rav Chaim's words, the more a person negates himself, the greater he becomes. Only Moshe Rabbeinu, the humblest of all men, reached his full potential. Remarkably, the phrase "be all that you can be" is associated with military service, which demands selflessness and even self-sacrifice for a noble goal.</P>
<P>In a further irony, the more popular restatement of this theme has a chasidic source. The Rebbe Reb Zyshe told his followers that he did not fear that he would be asked by the heavenly court, "Why weren't you Moshe Rabbeinu, R. Akiva, Rav Ashi, the Rambam, or the Ba'al Shem Tov". Only one question worried him: "Reb Zyshe, why weren't you Reb Zyshe?"</P>
<P>Self-centered modern society promotes self-fulfillment, gratification of one's physical and psychological needs and wants, and self-actualization, the maximum fulfillment of one's potential.</P>
<P>The Torah teaches that these two goals are contradictory. Moshe reached the highest level of self-actualization precisely because he humbly negated his sense of self, and lived as an absolute servant of his Master. May all of us learn from his example and attempt to understand the Torah without a personal agenda. Paradoxically, by this self-negation we will be enabled to narrow the line between who we can be and who we are.</P>

<P>"And Hashem made the two great lights"(1:16). The sun and moon were created equal in size, but the moon was reduced because it complained and said, "it is impossible for two kings to use the same crown" (Rashi).</P>
<P>The sun remained the same size because it heard its disgrace by the moon and did not respond. The Talmud (Shabbos 88b) says, "those who are insulted but do not insult, who are disgraced but do not reply, who perform with love and are happy in suffering, regarding them it says, 'those who love Him shall be as the sun going forth in its might" (Da'as Zekainim).</P>
<P>"And it (the sun) is like a groom coming forth from the bridal chamber" (Tehilim 19:6). This <I>pasuk</I> teaches an important lesson to a groom. Notwithstanding mutual love and dedication, a new couple, given the pressures and adjustments in their lives, is likely to experience tension. A new wife may say something that causes her husband to feel insulted. At such a time, the groom is commanded to be like the sun and not reply. By his silence, he will be great like the sun, and enjoy a peaceful marriage.</P>
<P>In fact, men are compared to the sun, a source of light, and women to the moon, who receives and reflects the sun's light. In addition, the sun is the same size and shape each day, whereas the moon's size and shape change each night. This corresponds to gender differences as well. A woman changes more than a man, both physically and emotionally, and this itself is part of her attraction (see Nida 31b). However, a man's role is to always be serene and happy, and a wife relies on this stability.</P>
<P>A husband must talk to his wife calmly, and be neither sad nor angry (Rambam Ishus 15:19). A wife has no such obligation (<I>ibid</I> 20), as by her nature she is more sensitive, and as such, more given to tears. The husband must be supportive, and, like the sun, be a constant source of strength, never replying to an insult.</P>
<P>The Chafetz Chaim (Shmiras Halashon, Sha'ar Hat'vuna 8) points out three ascending levels described in the Gemara (Shabbos 88b, quoted above): 1. A man does not insult someone who insulted him, but does respond 2. A man does not respond at all to an insult, but is bitter in his heart 3. A man does not respond, out of love for Hashem, and accepts the pain of insult with joy. One is required to be happier over suffering than over good (Tanchuma), and this includes suffering an insult.</P>
<P>In this vein, the second part of the description of the sun, rejoicing like a warrior to run the course, is apt for a groom as well. By not responding, and even rejoicing, when insulted, the husband reaches true greatness.</P>
<P>The warrior is happy because he is confident in his strength (Metzudos). At first glance, a confident person is more likely to respond to, and even insult, one who insults him. But in reality the opposite is true. One who lacks self-esteem is more prone to respond and insult in order to defend his honor. A confident person, like the sun, need not engage in verbal self-defense.</P>
<P>Indeed this lesson applies to a husband throughout his marriage, in all situations. In this way he can run the course of a long and happy married life, and be like the sun going forth in its might.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[Two Women, Two Songs]]></title>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>On <I>Shabbos Shira</I> we read the songs of two prophetesses, Miriam and Devorah. These great leaders were not merely giants in their times; they are paradigms for two different paths of <I>avodas Hashem</I> for Jewish women of all generations.</P>
<P>Miriam personified the incredible devotion of Jewish women to the bearing and raising of children, ensuring the continuity of our people. She is first introduced to us as Pu'ah (Shmos 1:15), who coos to the child and soothes crying babies (Rashi). Later, Miriam convinces her father to remarry her mother despite Pharoh's decree to kill all newborn males (Rashi 2:1). As a result, all of the Israelite men followed this example, and many more children were born (Sotah 12a).</P>
<P>Indeed, the redemption from Egypt was a reward to the righteous women. They, like Miriam, persuaded their exhausted and despondent husbands to have more children (Sotah 11b, Rashi 38:8). Logic may have been on the side of the men, and Miriam's father Amram, the <I>Gadol Hador</I>. But the intuition, courage, and emotional strength of the women, led by Miriam herself, ultimately prevailed.</P>
<P>Miriam practiced what she preached. She married Kalev and bore him a son, Chur (Rashi 17:10). In sum, Miriam was the prototype of a mother in Israel, enabling many others to have large families (1:20) despite threats, decrees, and privation.</P>
<P>Devorah, the subject of the <I>Haftorah</I> of <I>Shabbos Shira</I>, represents a totally different model of <I>avodas Hashem</I>. She was a judge (Shoftim 4:4), working outside the home in the public sphere. We read nothing about her children or family, but rather of her issuing military orders (<I>ibid.</I>4:6,7,14).</P>
<P>The songs of these illustrious personalities reflect their respective roles. Miriam sang with a tambourine, with music that inspired all the women to dance (15:20). She sang with heart and emotion, as befits a midwife who witnessed the miracle of birth countless times, and who now saw the open miracle of <I>krias Yam Suf</I>.</P>
<P>Her text was brief and simple, "Sing to Hashem for He is exalted above the arrogant, having hurled horse with its rider into the sea" (Shmos 15:21). Apparently, this text was repeated over and over again, in an emotional outpouring of song and dance, for women only.</P>
<P>Devorah, on the other hand, composed a lengthy and complex poem (5:2-31). It was probably read, and not sung musically, for men and women, together with Barak Ben Avinoam (5:1). As a cerebral leader, a judge and military strategist, this was the appropriate <I>shira </I>for her. A brilliant, poetic depiction, replete with nuance and imagery, was Devorah's way of praising Hashem.</P>
<P>Even the introductions to these two songs indicate the differences between the authors. Miriram's tambourine evoked the joy necessary to experience the Divine Presence. The women whom she led overcame the pain of the bearing and raising of large families and felt divine inspiration through music (Kli Yakar 15:20).</P>
<P>These same women, noted for righteousness for convincing their husbands to have more children, are righteous for another reason as well. They had faith that Hashem would perform miracles for them, and, therefore, took tambourines from Egypt (Rashi 15:20). Indeed, it was the very same faith that enabled them to raise families, even when the logic of their husbands and Amram considered it futile and unwise.</P>
<P>Devorah begins her song "I, to Hashem Shall I sing" (5:3). Miriam needs no such introduction. Her role is clearly <I>l'sheim shomayim</I>, for the sake of Heaven. However, a public figure like Devorah might be suspected of ulterior motives, such as the pursuit of glory or egalitarianism. Therefore, Devorah must preface her <I>shira</I> by saying that her song, and her life's work, are <I>lashem</I>.</P>
<P>Today, many more women work out of the home than in past generations. This provides an opportunity for <I>kiddush Hashem</I>. People observe Jewish womens' honesty and politeness, their speech and dress which reflect Torah,not the pervasive vulgarity of modern society, and are moved to love Hashem (Yoma 86a).</P>
<P>Many righteous women struggle to juggle the roles of Devorah and Miriam simultaneously. Some face scorn in a workplace which emphasizes a modern version of self-fulfillment to the exclusion of the Torah's emphasis on bearing and raising children. Fortunately, many experts in the secular world are now recognizing and publicizing the critical role of mothers and fathers in raising their own children, even at the expense of career advancement (U.S. News, Jan. 2002).</P>
<P>Many other equally righteous women devote the best years of their lives entirely to their families, in the spirit of Miriam, It is the duty of Torah society to encourage this unifocal devotion, which has enabled <I>Am Yisrael</I> to flourish through the generations. Especially when careers and opportunities are available, the traditional role of wife and mother must be strengthened.</P>
<P>The lives and songs of Miriam and Devorah demonstrated that there are many ways for women to perform <I>avodas Hashem</I> - <I>l'sheim shomayim</I>. May the righteous women of today, as their ancestresses in Egypt, enable <I>Am Yisrael</I> to be rewarded with the <I>geula shleima</I>.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[Compromise]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Mordechai Willig]]></author>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: miketz]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>"One who blesses a compromiser, such as Yehuda, is a blasphemer" (Sanhedrin 6b). The Meshech Chochma (37:26) suggests that the sons of Bilha and Zilpa did not wish to kill Yosef (see Rashi 37:2), while the four sons of Leah who were present at the time (Reuven was absent) did. Yehuda was the deciding vote. Had Yehuda insisted that Yosef be returned safely to Yaakov, he would have prevailed by a five to four vote. In this context, compromise is indeed reprehensible.</P>
<P>Many years after the sale of Yosef, another compromise was proposed. When accused of stealing Yosef's royal cup, the brothers agreed that if the cup was found in their possession, the one found to have stolen the cup shall die, and they would all be slaves to Yosef (44:9). After the cup is found in Binyamin's bag, Yosef states that Binyamin will be a slave, and the brothers are free to leave (44:17). Under the circumstances, this compromise seems reasonable. Yet, Yehuda forcefully rejects this arrangement, insists that Binyamin be released, and offers himself as a slave instead (44:33). Furthermore, Yehuda threatens Yosef (Rashi 44:18), and is undeterred by the risk of his aggressive posture (see Rashi 42:14). This refusal to accept Binyamin's servitude represents Yehuda's <I>teshuva</I> for his earlier blasphemous compromise.</P>
<P>Still another compromise is presented to the brothers as they are about to bury Yaakov. Esav claims that the available gRave in <I>Ma'aras Hamachpelah</I> is his, and denies that Yaakov purchased it from him. After negotiations, the brothers agree to postpone the burial until Naftali returns from Mitzrayim with the deed. Chushim, Dan's deaf son, is enraged at the disgrace to his grandfather's body and kills Esav (Sotah 13a).</P>
<P>Rav Chaim Shmuelevitz (Sichos Mussar, 5733 - 6) explains that the brothers were gradually entrapped into negotiations and compromise, and were therefore insensitive to the disgrace of their father's remains. Only Chushim, who couldn't hear the give and take, but was suddenly confronted with the reality of the situation, responded to Esav's preposterous position and the resulting disgrace of Yaakov's body, and acted accordingly. However, according to the Yerushalmi (Kesubos 1:5, see Shita Mekubetzes 7b), it was Yehuda who killed Esav when he prevented the burial of Yaakov. Once again, Yehuda rejects a compromise, even at the risk of Esav killing him in self-defense, and at the cost of subsequent hostilities by Esav's descendants against Yehuda's (ibid). This completes his <I>teshuva</I> for the earlier ill-advised compromise.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">II</P>
<P>When the Jewish people gathered around Aharon Hakohen and demanded that he make gods for them, he compromised and acceded to their request, resulting in the creation of the <I>Eigel Hazahav</I> (Golden Calf). He did so either to avoid worse consequences if he would be killed (Sanhedrin 7a, see Rashi), or to stall in the hope that Moshe would quickly return (Shemos 32:1-5, see Rashi). This compromise, like Yehuda's, is deemed blasphemous (Tosafos, though, disagrees with this understanding). Aharon incurred Hashem's wrath, and was severely punished (Devarim 9:20, see Rashi). Perhaps the <I>tikkun</I> (correction) for Aharon's compromise was the uncompromising heroism of his descendants. Pinchas risked his life to zealously destroy a public sinner (Bamidbar 25:7-15, Sanhedrin 82). And Matisyahu, following this example, rejected the blandishments of King Antiochus, and killed a public sinner as well as the king's emissaries (Macabees I). His subsequent call of "<I>Mi Lashem Elai</I>" ("whoever if to Hashem join me") echoed Moshe's response to the sin of the Golden Calf allowed by Aharon (Shemos 32:26). And the rest is history, i.e. the story of Chanukah.</P>
<P>Sometimes even silence is a punishable compromise. When Paroh plotted to outsmart <I>Am Yisroel</I> and thereby destroy them (Shemos 1:10, see Ramban), he consulted three advisors. Bilam, who advised him, was ultimately killed. Yisro fled, and was rewarded. Iyov was silent, and was sentenced to terribly painful and agonizing suffering (<I>yissurim</I>) (Sotah 11a). Iyov's compromise seems reasonable. After all, his protest would not accomplish anything. Rav Chaim Shmuelevitz (Sichos Mussar, 5733-5) interprets that Iyov's silence reflected insensitivity. When one is in pain, he cries out even though the cry accomplishes nothing. For not feeling the pain of others, Iyov was sentenced to pain that would cause him to cry out.</P>
<P>On Chanukah, we read the story of Yosef and his brothers. We are reminded that compromise, a laudable and critical approach, can sometimes be blasphemous. Adherence to principle occasionally demands uncompromising defiance, even when there are risks and/or consequences. Even silence, the best of all attributes (see Avos 1:17) is not always appropriate.</P>
<P>There is a time for everything, a time to be silent and a time to speak, a time for war and a time for peace (Koheles 3:1,7,8). As we have seen above, there is much room for error when deciding whether a given time demands that one compromise or stand on principle. May our Torah leaders be given the insight to correctly determine what time it is, and may we be given the strength to follow proper Torah leadership.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[Blessing or Curse]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Mordechai Willig]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2002]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: reeh]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<I><P>Parshas Reeh</I> opens with a stark choice offered by Hashem: blessing or curse. The same word (<I>reeh</I>) and a similar choice are found in <I>Parshas Nitzovim</I> (30:15): life and good, or death and evil. Why does the negative alternative deteriorate from curse to death?</P>
<P>The Meshech Chochma (30:11) attributes this change to the intervening <I>mitzva</I> of <I>teshuvah</I> (30:1-10). Violations of Torah law are punished by a curse, but are not fatal. Hashem recognizes human frailty, and does not impose a death penalty for a momentary lapse. </P>
<P>The <I>mitzva</I> of <I>teshuvah</I>, which offers a remarkable opportunity to eliminates one's sins, is a two-edged sword. If one fails to repent, he is punished not only for the original <I>aveira</I>, but also for not doing <I>teshuvah</I>. Since one can repent at any time, the failure to do so cannot be viewed as a momentary lapse. Therefore, the penalty for one's persistent refusal to repent is referred to as death.</P>
<P>On that very day, when we were given the <I>mitzva</I> of <I>teshuvah</I> (<I>P.N</I>. 30:11), the life and death choice was presented (30:15). Moreover, on the same day, the two contrasts- life and death, and blessing and curse - were juxtaposed (30:19). This teaches that it is the failure to do <I>teshuvah</I> which increases the punishment.</P>
<P>Remarkably, <I>Parshas reeh</I> is always read on the Shabbos before the beginning of Elul. At this point in time, before the month of <I>teshuvah</I> the negative choice is called curse. <I>Nitzavim</I> is always read on the last Shabbos in Elul. At this stage, after failing to do <I>teshuvah</I> in the month designated for it, the negative choice is called death.</P>
<P>One whose good and bad deeds are equal of <I>Rosh Hashana</I> is given a suspended sentence until <I>Yom Kippur</I>. If he does not repent, he is sealed in the Book of Death (<I>Rambam Teshuvah 3:3). </I>The Lechem Mishna asks, why does he deserve death? He answers that the failure to repent in the ten days of <I>teshuvah</I> is itself a sin which seals his fate.</P>
<P>On <I>Yom Kippur</I> itself, when <I>teshuvah</I> is more readily accepted, the failure to do <I>teshuvah</I> is an even greater sin. In the Meshech Chochma's formulation (30:20), one who does not repent would be better off if there was no <I>Yom Kippur</I>, of if he died on <I>Erev Yom Kippur</I>. The expression "<I>din vecheshbon</I>" (<I>Avos 3:1)</I> refer, respectively, to the original <I>aveira</I> and the lack of <I>teshuvah</I>, and the latter sin is greater.</P>
<P>This dual expression reflects the nature of the two sins. Hashem ultimately judges the original error of commission, often the result of a fleeting error of judgment. The more grievous error of omission, the persistent, and therefore calculated failure to do <I>teshuvah</I> is subject to a <I>cheshbon </I>(accounting) with more drastic consequences.</P>
<P>During the month of Elul, ushered in by <I>Parshas Reeh</I>, every Jew must make a <I>cheshbon hanaefesh</I> ( a self-accounting) which is a prerequisite to <I>teshuvah</I>. The customary <I>shofar</I> is a wake-up call to use the special opportunity of Elul, lest the unwillingness to seize the opportunity be held against us. This call is especially critical this year, when Elul begins while many are in vacation areas which are not so conducive to <I>teshuvah</I>.</P>
<P>In the month of Av, we conclude <I>Eicha</I> by beseeching Hashem- bring us back to You and we shall return. In Elul this is insufficient. Since the time is so propitious for <I>teshuvah</I>, we must take the initiative. Hence, <I>Ani L'Dodi V'Dodi Li, </I>whose acronym is Elul.</P>
<P><CENTER><B>II</b></center></P>
<P>The opening of <I>Parshas Reeh</I> promises blessing if we listen to, i.e. observe, Hashem's <I>mitzvos</I>. However, <I>Chazal</I>, commenting on a <I>pasuk</I> read later in Elul consider one who learns and teaches Torah and observes <I>miztvos</I> to be cursed if he had the ability to strengthen others but did not do so. The <I>Yerushalmi</I> (<I>Sotah</I> 7:4) illustrates this point with the following incident.</P>
<P>During his reign, Menashe destroyed all the <I>sifrei </I>Torah in Israel and led the people astray. During the subsequent reign of Yoshiyahu, a <I>sefer</I> Torah was found, open to the <I>pasuk</I>, "Cursed is the one who will not uphold the words of this Torah (27:26). Yoshiyahu tore his garments and exclaimed, "<I>Alai lehakim</I>", it is incumbent upon me to uphold. He led an unprecedented <I>teshuvah</I> movement which forestalled the process of the destruction of the <I>Beis Hamikdash </I>(<I>Melachim</I> II, 22 and 23). </P>
<P>This spiritual revival was cut short by the untimely death of Yoshiyahu, to which the entire fourth <I>pasuk</I> of <I>Eichah</I> is devoted (<I>Rashi</I> 4:1). <I>Rashi</I> notes that the other sons of <I>Tzion</I> are included in the <I>perek</I>. This appears to be an understatement. Except for one reference to Hashem's anointed being trapped (4:20), the entire <I>perek</I> bemoans the fate of <I>Am Yisrael</I>. Why is this called a lament over Yoshiyahu? Moreover, why did he deserve such special recognition if all he achieved was a relatively short delay of the <I>churban</I>?</P>
<P>The last two <I>pesukim</I> refer to the destruction of the second <I>Bais Hamikdash</I>, and the fact that the exile of Edom is the final one (Rashi 4:21, 22). Why is this incorporated into the lament over Yoshiyahu, immediately after the reference to him as Hashem's anointed?</P>
<P>The answer to these questions is the incredibly long-lasting effect of Yoshiyahu's <I>teshuva</I> movement. In the fifteen subsequent years of his reign, an entire generation was returned to Torah. Even his wicked successors could not eradicate this influence. Thus, the "precious children of <I>Tziyon</I>" (4:2) owed their exalted state to Yoshiyahu, and the lament for them is a lament for him as well.</P>
<P>When the initial exile took place, the Torah scholars and leaders established themselves in Bavel (Melachim II 24:16). These great men, who developed only because of Yoshiyahu, later led the movement to rebuild the <I>Bais Hamikdash</I>. Since the second <I>Bais Hamikdash </I>was built because of the influence of Yoshiyahu, its subsequent destruction is bemoaned in the <I>pasuk</I> following the one which describes the king's untimely death. And the promise of no future exiles, which heartens us during these difficult times in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>, is a dramatic capstone, a measure of consolation in the face of destruction, and the culmination of the amazing influence of Yoshiyahu on Jewish history throughout the ages.</P>
<P>While individuals do not wield as much influence as monarchs, their decisions can also have long-term impact. In effect, every person should say - <I>alay l'hakim</I>, it is incumbent upon me to influence my family and community, now and forever. Only then can he truly be blessed.</P>
<P>As we usher in and proceed through Elul, we are required to make two <I>cheshbonos</I>, accountings. First, we must improve ourselves and repent for our misdeeds. Then, we must analyze how we can uphold Torah and <I>mitzvos</I> for others as well. May we all merit the dual <I>bracha</I> of <I>asher tishme'u</I>, that you observe, and <I>asher yakim</I>, that you uphold the words, and the <I>mitzvos</I>, of our holy Torah.</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: shemos]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>"Behold, he is going out to meet you and when he sees you he will rejoice in his heart" ( <I>Shemos </I>4:14). Hashem had sent Moshe to redeem Am Yisrael (3:10), but Moshe asked Hashem to send Aharon, Moshe's older brother, who had served as a prophet (Rashi 4:10). Moshe feared that were he to assume superiority over Aharon that it would cause resentment (Rashi 10:14). Instead, Hashem promised Moshe that Aharon would rejoice, not resent. Aharon's heart, which had the capacity to resist sibling rivalry and jealousy, would be rewarded with the <I>choshen</I> (breastplate worn by the <I>Kohen Gadol</I>- High Priest) (Rashi 10:14). </P>
<P>Years later, after Korach sought Aharon's <I>kehuna</I> (priesthood) and was killed, Hashem told Aharon, "Behold I have given you the gift of <I>kehuna," </I>(<I>Bamidbar</I> 18:8). "Behold" (<I>Hineh) </I>is an expression of joy, as in "Behold...he will rejoice in his heart" (Rashi).</P>
<P>Korach sinned because he was jealous and coveted a leadership position (Rashi 16:1). Aharon, who lost his leadership position, was not jealous, but rather happy with his lot (<I>Avos</I> 4:1).</P>
<P>This is the meaning of the expression "Behold". One must recognize that his lot is ordained by Hashem, and be happy with it. Everyone will be called by name, set in place and given a position. No one shall encroach upon your wealth or kingdom, even for as much as a hairsbreadth (<I>Yoma</I> 38b-39a).</P>
<P>The proof text for happiness with one's lot is, "when you eat of the labor of your hands, you are praiseworthy and all is well with you, " (<I>Tehillim</I> 128:2). This applies to family, wife and children, as well (128:3). The theme concludes with, "behold, for so is blessed the man who fears Hashem," (128:4). Fear of Hashem leads to the recognition of "Behold" and the happiness with one's lot that results.</P>
<P>Moshe refused to accept his mission of leadership for seven days, until Hashem became angry (Rashi 4:10). Moshe was punished in kind when his tenure as <I>Kohein Gadol</I> was terminated after seven days (<I>Medrash</I> <I>Rabba Vayikra</I> 11:6). At that point, Moshe sprinkled the oil of anointment on Aharon (<I>Vayikra</I> 8:30). The <I>medrash</I> (3:6) interprets the <I>pasuk</I> (<I>Tehillim</I> 133:2), "like the precious oil upon the head, running down the beard, the beard of Aharon," referring to this event. The <I>medrash </I>comments on the repetition of the word "beard", explaining that when Moshe saw the oil on Aharon's beard, he rejoiced as if it was running down his own. Moshe reciprocated Aharon's expression of joy and lack of jealousy.</P>
<P>This story is introduced by the <I>pasuk</I>, "Behold, how good and pleasant is the dwelling of brothers in unity." The same expression, "behold", describes the joy of these two great brothers, Moshe and Aharon. It also challenges all of us to eliminate jealousy and to happily accept the lot that Hashem has ordained for each and every one of us. Only then will we all be able to dwell as brothers in unity. How good and pleasant will it be!</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: bechukosai]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>At the beginning of <I>Parshas Bechukosai,</I> in enumerating the special blessings that the Jewish people will receive, the Torah includes, as Rashi notes: "Even five of the weakest of you will pursue on hundred, and one hundred of you will pursue ten thousand (and not "five hundred ten pursue ten thousand" as expected proportionately), as there is no comparing a small number of Torah observers to a large one". A large number of Torah observers constitute a <I>tzibur</I> (community), and a <I>tzibur</I> has its own rights, privileges, and benefits. </P>
<P>The <I>Gemara Berachos </I>(7b) teaches that even if one can not <I>daven</I> together with the <I>tzibur</I> in <I>shul</I>, they should try to <I>daven</I> at the time that the <I>tzibur</I> is <I>davening</I>, for that is an especially propitious moment. The <I>Gemara</I> understands this to be true based upon the <I>pasuk</I> "<I>va'ani t'filasi l'cha Hashem ais ratson</I>" ("but as for me, my prayer is to you, Hashem, at a favorable time") (<I>Tehilim</I> 69:14). When is a favorable time? At the time the <I>tzibur</I> <I>davens</I>. Moreover, Rav Nassan taught that Hashem does not despise the <I>tefila</I> of the <I>rabim</I> (numerous). </P>
<P>The same is true regarding the study of Torah. The <I>Gemara</I> in <I>Berachos</I> (8a) teaches that one should always complete the Torah portion of the week, <I>shnayim mikra veechad targum</I> (reading the Hebrew text twice and the Targum once) with the congregation. What is the relevance of finishing with the congregation? Is not the main purpose to understand the weekly Torah portion? This teaching demonstrates that in addition to the actual learning, there is also the significant ingredient of communal involvement. In Judaism the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</P>
<P>This is further substantiated by the <I>Talmud Rosh Hashana</I> (18a) commenting on the verse from Isaiah (55:6) "<I>Dirshu hashem behimatzo..</I>", "Seek Hashem when He can be found, call upon Hashem when He is near," when is He near? During the ten days before Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. This refers to an individual, however, a <I>tzibbur</I> can always repent and overturn an evil decree.</P>
<P>The city of <I>Yerushalayim</I> is described by King David as, " a city that is united together," (Psalms 122:3). The Sforno explains this to mean that when they needed to expand the city to accommodate the multitudes of pilgrims that converged upon it thrice yearly to celebrate the festivals, the newer sections blended perfectly with the original sections. In addition, <I>Yerushalayim</I> served as a unifying social force, uniting young and old, rich and poor, learned and ignorant. Throughout the year these groups were divided by social barriers, but on the festivals, <I>Yerushalayim</I> integrated and united them into <I>chaverim</I>, comrades, who embraced each other as parts of one indivisible nation. Moreover, the Talmud in <I>Bava Kamma</I> (82b) teaches that all of the Land of Israel was divided among the tribes, except for Jerusalem, which remained the property of the entire nation. Through their coming to <I>Yerushalayim</I> the people were privileged to not only "nor did any man say to his fellow 'the space space is insufficient for me to stay overnight in Jerusalem'" (<I>Avos</I> 5:7), but in addition they were afforded the special divine protection of "no man shall covet your land when you go up to appear before the Lord your God three times in the year" (<I>Shmos</I> 34:24).</P>
<I><P>Hashgacha Pratis</I> (Divine involvement in the affairs of man) may be seen in both positive and negative circumstances. King David in <I>Hallel</I> (<I>Tehillim</I> 118:21) says<I>, "odcha ki anisani va't'hi li l'yeshua</I>" ("I thank you for you have answered me and become my salvation"). While Targum Radak and Sforno understand "<I>anisani</I>" as "answered me", others, including Midrash Socher Tov and Malbim, interpret "<I>anisani</I>" as referring to suffering, in which case Dovid is thanking Hashem for causing him to suffer, because the suffering purged him and made him worthy of being answered and saved. Hashem revealed Himself to Dovid through the suffering.</P>
<P>This idea is very powerfully portrayed in the following Talmudic passage. The <I>Gemara Berachos</I> (7b) is perplexed by the introduction of <I>perek</I> 3 of <I>Tehillim</I> - "<I>Mizomor l'Dovid"</I> ("a song of David"). The <I>perek</I> recounts the tragic episode in his life, when David had to flee from his son Avshalom, who wanted his life and his throne. The Talmud asks, would not "<I>kinah l'Dovid"</I> ("a lament of David") have been a more appropriate beginning? The Talmud answers that when King David had been told through Nasan the prophet that God "will raise evil against you from your own house" (<I>Shmuel</I> II, 12:11), David became dejected. He was only afraid that a servant or an illegitimate child of his household would lead a rebellion against him, and would certainly not show him any mercy. When he saw that his own son Avshalom, he was relieved knowing that his son would not act cruelly to him.</P>
<P>Reb Yonasan Eibshitz zt"l asks, how is Dovid consoled by the fact that his son wants to kill him? He answers very sharply, if Dovid would be challenged by a servant who desired his throne, this would be a common, ordinary happening. Uprisings of this sort happen throughout the world constantly. This trouble would not be so obvious that it was emanating from Hashem, and would not serve to purge him entirely. However, a son rebelling against his father is a most unusual occurrence, and once he saw that the pain he was experiencing was supernatural in nature, he realized it was coming <I>from "Hashem Elokainu</I> (God of Justice) <I>Hashem</I> (God of Mercy) <I>echad</I> (is one)". Thus he was able to respond to his difficulties <I>Mizmor L'dovid</I>.</P>
<P>Rav Elyashiv applied this interpretation of Reb Yonasan Eibshitz to today's difficult situation in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>. People have gone to war against their enemies many times in history, but never have they employed suicide bombers. Never have children been recruited as suicide bombers. From the painful supernatural nature of these acts of terror, may we aspire to the immediate supernatural intervention of Hashem on behalf of His <I>tsibur</I>.</P>
<P>Finally, the inspiring words of the Bnei Yisaaschar are especially comforting today. Dovid in <I>Tehillim</I> (121:4) declares, "<I>hineh, lo yanum v'lo yishan shomer Yisrael</I>" ("behold, the guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps"). At first glance the poet is using his poetic license and repeating the same idea (i.e. sleep and slumber). However, upon further reflection, the Bnei Yisaaschar explains that there is a difference between slumber and sleep. The Talmud (<I>Megillah</I> 18b) defines "<I>yanum" </I>(slumber) as dozing - that if one calls his name, he responds. In contrast the one who is sleeping ("<I>yishan</I>") does not respond. Thus, when we were privileged to have prophets, they would call to Hashem, and He would respond, telling them what was the cause of the punishment and its remedy. Thus the Guardian of Israel does not slumber. However, sleep is that state wherein one calls upon the individual and he does not answer. Similarly, in a time of <I>hester panim</I>, when Hashem is more concealed, one could get the impression that He does not answer. Therefore Dovid promises that even at such a time, He does not sleep. Remember, we close with that with which we opened, Hashem does not reject the <I>davening</I> of the <I>tzibur</I>. Reach out to your fellow Jew, join the <I>tzibur</I>, thereby helping <I>Klal Yisrael</I>.</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: kisisa]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>This <I>shabbos</I> is <I>Parshas Parah</I>, coming at the same time as <I>Parshas Ki-Tissa</I>, in which we find the sin of the Golden Calf. Rashi, in his commentary on the end of Chapter 19 in <I>Bamidbar</I>, where the Torah presents the laws of the <I>Para Adumah</I> (Red Cow), cites, from Rav Moshe Hadarshon: Why was a cow utilized to attain purification for the Jewish nation? A parable: It may be compared to a situation where a servant's child defiled the king's palace. They said: Let the mother come and clean up the mess of her young. Similarly, the Jewish nation became defiled by a [golden] calf, let its mother [a cow] come and atone for the calf (<I>Medrash Tanchuma - Chukas Par</I> 8).</P>
<P>At first glance the connection between the two phenomena seems remote. Rav Avigdor Nevintzol, shlit"a,  of Yerushalayim, offers a most profound understanding and connection between the two happenings. He suggests that the sin of the Golden Calf did not begin with (<I>Shmos </I>32:4) <I>Bnei Yisroel</I> declaring, "These are your gods, o Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt." Rather, their sin began when they did not follow Moshe's instructions (<I>Shmos</I> 24:14) when, prior to his ascending the mountain he informed the people, "Behold Aharon and Chur [Moshe's nephew, son of Miriam and Calev) are with you. Whoever has a claim [problem] shall draw near to them." Moshe clearly left an address and source for problem resolution in his absence.</P>
<P>The <I>Medrash Shmos Rabbah</I> (41:7) teaches that after the Jewish nation miscalculated the day that Moshe was to return, Satan showed them an image of Moshe being carried as dead in the firmaments of heaven. Rather than following Moshe's directions, and inquiring of Aharon and Chur as to what the proper response should be, Chur was approached with a solution to the impending crisis. It was insisted that he make gods who would subsequently lead them. Instead of listening to Chur, who offered rebuke, and reminded the petitioners of the miracles and wonders that Hashem had wrought on their behalf, they killed Chur (<I>Medrash Vayikra Raba </I>10:3). Aharon was then threatened, and when he saw that Chur had been killed, reasoned that "Chur was a prophet, and I am a kohain, lest they kill me and be guilty of, 'Will priest and prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord (Lamentations 2:20'." He was concerned that this would result in the people suffering greater consequences, so he tried to delay and asked for contributions of gold jewelry.</P>
<P>The sin of the Golden Calf began with the Jewish nation rejecting the authority of its leaders. To atone for this sin, Hashem gave them "205 Chukos HaTorah" this is the decree of the Torah! King Solomon himself declared (<I>Koheles 7:23)</I>, " I said I would become wise [would understand why a mixture that purifies the impure has the reverse effect on someone already pure] but it is still beyond me!" The entire <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>Para Adumah</I> (the Red Heifer) is based on accepting a higher authority. The <I>gemora Yoma</I> (14a) that cites the above frustration of Shlomo <I>Hamelech</I> is teaching that despite the apparent enigma of the <I>Para Adumah</I>  there is a reason for it, it is just beyond human comprehension.</P>
<P>The Torah, in <I>Devorim</I> (17:11) teaches us in regard to our accepting the authority of Torah scholars, "You shall not turn aside from that which they tell you, right or left." The Jew has turned to <I>Talmidei Chachamim</I> throughout the generations for wise sage advice and counsel, in addition to the precise understanding and application of Jewish law, for a number of reasons. Firstly, their familiarity with the breadth and expanse of torah, which addresses every aspect of life. Moreover, Rabi Meir teaches in the opening <I>baraisa</I> of <I>Avos</I> (6:1) that whoever engages in Torah study <I>lishma</I>, for its own sake, merits many things. In addition to the Torah knowledge..."From him people enjoy counsel and wisdom, understanding and strength, as it is said (Proverbs 8:14), "Mine are counsel and wisdom, I am understanding, mine is strength."</P>
<P>This may be further appreciated by the difference in blessing recited for an outstanding Torah scholar and that recited in honor of an outstanding secular scholar. The <I>gemora Brachos</I>  (58a) teaches, if one sees Torah scholars he recites, "<I>baruch shecholak michochmaso leyireyav, </I>blessed are You..who apportioned of His wisdom to those who fear Him. If one sees sages of the other nations, you recite, "<I>baruch shenosam michochmaso leberiosav</I>, Blessed are You...who gave of his wisdom to his creatures. The Bach, in his commentary on the Shulchan Aruch, (Ohr Hachaim ch.224) explains that there is a great difference between "<I>shenosan</I>" and "<I>shecholak</I>"- apportioned. Regarding giving, it is a gift detached from the donor. However, "<I>shecholak</I>" denotes that the recipient has received an integral part of the donor. Since Hashem and torah knowledge are one and the same, the Torah scholar receives much more than factual knowledge. He has absorbed the word of Hashem through his studies, and lives it, thereby having greater insight into the world around him.</P>
<P>Too often we find that a great secular scholar is not necessarily a moral person of great integrity. His knowledge does not necessarily transform his character. Not so regarding the Torah scholar; his Torah knowledge transforms his being into a Godly being, literally a walking <I>sefer Torah</I>. It is understandable that from his spiritual heights he can see things that the average person can not.</P>
<P>May we learn from <I>parshas Ki Tissa</I> and <I>Parah</I> to appreciate the blessing that Shlomo <I>HaMelech</I> taught in <I>Koheles</I>, "the sun rises and the sun sets," that before the sun sets on the Jewish world with the passing of a <I>tzadik</I> another one rises to take his place. May we appreciate, be respectful and most of all "drink in their words thirstily (<I>Avos</I> 1:4)."</P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The Torah testifies in <I>Parshas Toldos</I> (26:5) that Avraham kept the Torah before it was given. "Because Avraham obeyed My voice, and observed My safeguards, My commandments, My decrees, and My torahs". Rava teaches (Talmud Yoma 28b) that the above verse even includes <I>eruv tavshilin</I> (the procedure enabling one to cook on a festival (<I>yom-tov</I>) that falls on a Friday, to prepare food needed for <I>Shabbos</I>). How then could Avraham purchase <I>Meoras Hamachpeila</I> for only "four hundred silver shekels in negotiable currency", and how could Yaakov purchase the <I>b'chora</I> for bread and lentil stew, when both patriarchs knew the true value of their respective purchases? Why were these transactions not in violation of the Torah law (Vayikra 25:14) "<I>Al tonu</I>" ("do not aggrieve one another")?</P>
<P>The late Rav Eliyahu Michkovsky zt"l of Kfar Chasidim answers with the following insightful story. There once was a Jewish man in need of financial assistance to marry off a daughter. When he asked his rebbe for a blessing, the rebbe advised him that he should avail himself of the first business opportunity that presents itself, for in that deal Hashem's blessing would be found. On the way home, at an inn, a group of businessmen were meeting. When they noticed him, one of them, wishing to have a good time, offered him the opportunity to purchase his share of <I>olam habah</I> for a ruble. The Jew in need immediately recalled his rebbe's advice and accepted the deal. They drew up a contract, it was signed, and the ruble changed hands. When the seller came home and told his wife of the proceedings, she immediately berated him and insisted he re-negotiate with the purchaser, as she would not stay married to a man who had no "<I>olam habah</I>". When he found the purchaser, the latter refused to reverse the sale. The seller had no recourse but to appeal to the buyer's rebbe that he instruct his disciple to reverse the sale, as the seller's marriage depended upon it.</P>
<P>The rebbe of the buyer ruled that by the letter of the law his disciple was justified in maintaining the status quo; however, for the right price, perhaps the buyer could be persuaded to change his mind. The rebbe informed the seller that the purchaser needed to marry of his child, and if the seller would assist in financing the marriage, the purchaser would re-negotiate. Indeed that is what happened. Upon leaving the rebbe, the seller asked, "Yesterday the buyer paid me a ruble for the merchandise. Is it fair that I have to now pay several thousand fold?!" The rebbe responded that the cost of the merchandise was determined by its worth. Yesterday, the seller scorned the worth of <I>olam-haba</I> and thus its worth was but a ruble; currently, his assessment and appreciation of <I>olam-haba</I> was much greater and the price reflected this.</P>
<P>The Torah teaches (<I>Toldos</I> 25:34) that Eisav spurned the <I>bechora</I> (birth right), thus the bread and stew were appropriate payment. Similarly, the Zohar in <I>Parshas Chayei Sarah</I> teaches that Efron looked into the cave of <I>machpeila</I> and only saw darkness; when Avraham looked in he saw light. Efron thus received a very fair price for his darkness, while Avraham was purchasing the entrance to <I>Gan-Eden</I>.</P>
<P>If one has respect for a concept, then it will abide with him and enhance him. However, if he is disrespectful of it, it abandons him. Eisav showed disdain for the <I>b'chora</I> and thus it was taken from him. Yaakov, who showed great respect for the <I>b'chora,</I> became its natural possessor.</P>
<P>We find this concept in the Talmud (<I>Berachos</I> 62b), where we are taught that Dovid showed disrespect for clothing (by cutting the corner off Shaul's garment (<I>Shmuel</I> I, 24:5). When Dovid was old although he was covered with garments, they could not warm him.</P>
<P>We celebrate in this month of <I>Kislev</I> the <I>yom-tov</I> of Chanukah. The Bach in his commentary on Shulchan Aruch (Ohr Hachaim 670) asserts that at the time of the second <I>Beis Hamikdosh </I>the Jews "<I>nisrashlu ba'avodah</I>", were lax in their Temple service (they neither appreciated it nor honored it properly). For this reason they almost lost it, and were forced to fight for it. Once they showed that they were <I>moser nefesh</I> (willing to give their lives) for the <I>Beis Hamikdosh</I>, demonstrating their appreciation thereof, they were worthy of repossessing the Temple.</P>
<P>[Similarly, the Medrash Rabbah (Braishis, Chapter 63) based on the verse "Yaakov said, swear to me as this day" (25:33) teaches that Yaakov sacrificed on behalf of the <I>b'chora</I>.]</P>
<P>Shabbos is a gift from Hashem to <I>Bnai Yisroel</I>. In accordance with our appreciation, reverence of, and <I>mesiras nefesh</I> for the Shabbos, will be our portion and experience of it. Thus, especially this time of the year, with Friday being a short day, one should avoid tRaveling on Friday afternoon, lest it lead to an unexpected violation of Shabbos. The care to refrain from discussing and reading business and other secular matters on Shabbos demonstrates our proper assessment of Shabbos, and thus enables one to experience its sanctity.</P>
<P>Finally, in the realm of relationships between spouses, parents, and children, one has to be careful not to emulate Eisav's trait of scorning. One honors a relationship not only by devoting time to it, but also through prioritization. To work hard at earning a living for ones' children at the expense of meaningful and qualitative time such as joint acts of <I>chessed</I> and family Torah study, is a form of scorning these most potentially precious relationships.</P>
<P>In one verse the Torah communicates it all - "<I>Vayivez esav es habechora." </I>Eisav spurned the <I>b'chora</I> therefore Hashem took it from him; Yaakov valued the b'chora and honored it, and therefore Hashem sees to it that the <I>b'chora</I> is still honoring Yaakov.</P>

<P>The Rambam (<I>Hilchot Chametz u-Matzah</I> 7:1) begins his discussion of the mitzvah <I>of sippur yetziat mitzrayim</I> on the night of <I>Pesach</I> by invoking a parallel obligation to remember and recognize the sanctity of <I>Shabbat</I> ( "<I>kemo she-neemar zachor et yom hashabbat</I> "), that is the basis for reciting <I>kiddush</I> on <I>Shabbat</I>. Why does the Rambam feel the need to link <I>sippur yetziat mitzrayim </I>with <I>kiddush</I> on <I>shabbat</I>, and how does this intriguing link enhance our appreciation and understanding of the mitzvah of <I>sippur yetziat mitzrayim</I>? </P>
<P>The <I>gemara</I> in <I>Pesachim</I> (117b) does connect the "<I>zakhor</I>"'s of <I>shabbat</I> and <I>Pesach</I>, albeit in the opposite direction. It establishes the need to refer to the exodus in <I>shabbat kiddush</I> on this basis. It is possible that the Rambam viewed the very fact that <I>yetziat mitzrayim</I> is incorporated into the <I>kiddush</I> of <I>shabbat</I> as indicative of its wide scope and great prominence, which in turn adds greater urgency and accentuates its centrality on <I>Pesach</I> itself. Perhaps, absent its defining role on <I>Pesach</I>, this theme would not have impacted on <I>Shabbat</I> either. Moreover, it is conceivable that the Rambam perceived the bond between <I>Shabbat</I> and <I>Pesach</I>, reflected in the concept of "zakhor" that ties them together, as necessarily reciprocal. Thus, the <I>gemara</I> in <I>Pesachim</I>, establishing the incorporation of <I>yetziat mitzrayim</I> on <I>Shabbat</I>, dictates the relevance <I>of kedushat Shabbat</I> as a theme that enhances <I>sippur yetziat mitzrayim</I>, as well. In order to better comprehend these ideas, it is necessary to further explore the bond between <I>Shabbat</I> and <I>Pesach</I>. </P>
<P>The Torah itself links <I>Shabbat</I> and <I>avdut mitzrayim</I> in the second rendition of <I>the asseret ha-dibrot</I> (<I>Devarim</I> 5:14)-" <I>ve-zakharta ki eved hayitah be-eretz mitzrayim va-yotziachah Hashem Elokeinu mi-sham be-yad hazakah u-be-zeroa netuyah, al kein tzivchah Hashem Elokechah la-asot et yom ha-shabbat</I>". Indeed, the Maharsha (<I>Pesachim</I> 117b) questions why the insertion of the exodus into <I>shabbat kiddush</I> isn't simply rooted in this <I>pasuk</I>. While Ibn Ezra limits the role of <I>yetziat mitzrayim</I> to the inclusion of <I>shevitat eved</I> and Rashi explains that it serves only to underscore why we are obligated to adhere to any Divine obligation, the Rambam and Ramban do assign greater prominence to this link, which further exacerbates the Maharsha's question. The Ramban (<I>ad.loc</I>.) argues that <I>yetziat mitzrayim</I> strongly reinforces the primary theme of <I>zekher le-maaseh bereishit</I> that conveys our recognition of Hashem's unique role and status as the Omnipotent Creator who also intervenes and exercises <I>hashgachah</I> (Divine Providence) in the real world. [See, also, his comments on <I>Shemot</I> 20:2, and the end of <I>parshat Bo</I> etc.] The Rambam (<I>Moreh Nevuchim</I> 2:31) attaches even greater significance to <I>yetziat mitzrayim's</I> contribution to <I>Shabbat</I>. He argues that while the significance and stature of the day is due to the theological and philosophical affirmation of Hashem's role as Creator, the reason that we observe it is an expression of our recognition and appreciation of His overwhelming kindness reflected in the redemption from Egypt. </P>
<P>An analysis of the <I>gemara</I> in <I>Pesachim</I>, reveals other difficulties. The Rashbam asserts that the reference to "<I>zekher le-yetziat mitzrayim</I>" in the <I>kiddush</I> and <I>tefillah</I> of other holidays is derived directly (<I>binyan av</I>) from <I>Pesach</I>. The Maharsaha wonders why a similar mechanism could not have sufficed for <I>Shabbat</I>. Is their some greater resistance to this theme on <I>Shabbat</I>, which would also help explain why the <I>pasuk</I> in the <I>asseret ha-dibrot</I> was not a sufficient reason to accent this theme on <I>Pesach</I>. It is also, noteworthy, that, notwithstanding Rashbam's comment to the contrary, we do not refer to <I>yetziat mitzrayim</I> in <I>tefilat Shabbat</I> (See Rashash, <I>Pesachim</I> 117b). Other <I>rishonim</I> (Behag, Ran) assume that other holidays refer to the exodus because of their link with <I>Shabbat</I>! It seems that <I>Shabbat</I>, rather than <I>Pesach</I>, is the gateway for this theme in the broader scheme of the <I>moadim</I>, as only its role in <I>Shabbat</I> demonstrates its broader significance beyond <I>Pesach</I>. Tosafot Rid (<I>Pesachim</I>, ad. loc., <I>mahdurah telitah</I>) is disturbed by the irony that <I>Shabbat</I>, which is the foundation for <I>zechirat yetziat mitzrayim </I>of other festivals in <I>tefilah</I> as well as <I>kiddush</I>, limits its own reference to the exodus to the <I>kiddush</I>. Apparently, while the impact of the exodus on <I>Shabbat</I> is a model for other <I>moadim</I>, its own singular focus on <I>zecher le-maaseh bereishit</I> limits a fuller expression. Apparently, the themes of <I>Shabbat</I> and <I>Pesach</I>, reflected by their motifs- the exodus and the creation- are both competing and complimentary. </P>
<P>It is unsurprising that these two pivotal episodes compete for prominence in several contexts. <I>Chazal</I> and the <I>mefarshim</I> question why the Torah didn't begin with a discussion of Jewish history and <I>Pesach</I> - "<I>ha-hodesh ha-zeh lahem rosh hadashim</I>", instead of the account of creation. While Rashi (<I>Bereishit</I> 1:1) needs to justify this reality, the Ramban asserts that creation is the most appropriate foundation for the Torah. When Hashem introduces Himself in Revelation of <I>mattan Torah</I> by referring to His role in the exodus, <I>meforshim</I> debate whether ideally it would have been more appropriate to make reference to the apparently more impressive and universally significant act of creation. Again, different perspectives emerge in the assessment of the Torah's choice (see Ibn Ezra, Ramban <I>Shemot</I> 20:2 etc.). When the Torah delineates the festivals, it formulates two different beginnings, one associated with <I>Shabbat</I> (<I>Vayikra</I> 23:2- "<I>moadei Hashem asher tikrau otam mikraei kodesh eileh hem moadai</I>"), the other with <I>Pesach</I> (<I>Vayikra</I> 23:4- "<I>eileh moadei Hashem mikraei kodesh asher tikrau otam be-moadam.</I>" ). [For a different perspective on this point, see the <a href = "http://www.torahweb.org/torah/2000/parsha/rros_emor.html">Torahweb.org parshat Emor, 5760</a>.] <I>Shabbat</I> provides the model of <I>issur melachah</I> for all of the <I>moadim</I>, though that theme is primary and intrinsic to <I>Shabbat</I>. At the same time, the characteristic <I>heter ochel nefesh</I> that applies to all <I>moadim</I> (excluding <I>Yom Kippur</I>), has its origin in the model of <I>Pesach</I>, which is first formulated in the image of <I>Shabbat</I> - "<I>kol melachah lo yeaseh ba-hem"</I> (as opposed to the "<I>melechet avodah</I>" formulations of Emor- see Ramban, Shemot 23:7), and only then qualified- "<I>ach asher yeachel le-chol nefesh hu levado yeaseh la-chem</I>." The <I>rishonim</I> (see Ramach, <I>Hil</I>. <I>Yom Tov</I> 1:1) question why <I>Pesach</I> should serve as the model for this <I>halachah</I>. The parallel influence of <I>yetziat mitzrayim</I> and Creation, of <I>Pesach</I> and <I>Shabbat</I>, are striking. <I>Chazal</I> indicate that the entire week revolves around <I>Shabbat</I> (<I>Bezah</I> 16a) and the cycle of festivals and months takes its cue from <I>Pesach</I> -<I>Nissan</I>, the time of past and future redemption. Ramban develops the idea that numbers, rather than names are used to designate days and months because <I>Shabbat</I> and <I>Pesach</I> are the double foci of Jewish life. The use of numbers is a mechanism to maintain constant awareness of the centrality and inspirational quality of these episodes. </P>
<P>While the integrity of each event and theme requires a predominant focus in its own context, perhaps reflected in the omission of "<I>zecher le-yitziat mitzrayim</I>" in the <I>tefilah</I> of <I>Shabbat</I>, the relationship of these values is mutually enhancing and complimentary. An expansion of the Rambam's perspective, cited previously, which accentuates the differences between the two themes within the context of <I>Shabbat</I>, can be used to illustrate how each theme can enhance the other. Creation can be perceived predominantly as conveying a theological axiom that reflects Hashem's Existence and Omnipotence, even as it underscores that seemingly insuperable gap between Infinite Creator and impotent creation. Man did not even exist until the final stages of the creation process. On the surface, the truth of Creation is relevant not only to the covenantal community of <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>, but to universal mankind, as well. At first glance, it is puzzling that <I>Halachah</I> views <I>Shabbat</I> as the special <I>ot</I> of <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>, like <I>milah</I> etc., and even prohibits non-Jews from partaking in this day- "<I>goy she-shavat chayav mitah</I>". On the other hand, <I>yetziat mitzrayim </I>constitutes an acknowledgement of the close, personal bond between Hashem and <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>, attesting to a special <I>hashgahah</I>. It was a concrete experience, affecting and transforming a desperate people. Hashem's protection and intimate involvement seems almost inconsistent with His transcendence. </P>
<P>The fusion of <I>Shabbat</I> and <I>Pesach</I>, of Creation and the exodus projects a more ambitious and nuanced perspective. In light of the exodus, Hashem's personal involvement<I>- "ani ve-lo malach</I>..." and <I>Kelal Yisrael's</I> special status and destiny as "<I>am segulah</I>", one needs to reassess the nature and purpose of "<I>Bereishit</I>"-Creation. The apparent objective is, indeed, to create an environment conducive to the ideals of Torah and <I>mitzvot</I>- "<I>bishvil Torah (ve-yisrael) shenikra reishit</I>" (Rashi, Midrash Bereishit 1:1). Man surfaces only at the end of the process, not as an afterthought, but as the <I>telos</I>. The implication of insuperable distance is to be replaced by the quite different emphasis of <I>imatatio deii</I>- "<I>lehidamot la-Hashem</I>"-, which demands that man, <I>bezelem </I>Hashem, refrain from <I>melachah</I>. Observing <I>Shabbat</I> by means of <I>issur melachah</I> conveys both man's greatness and approximation to Hashem, as well as his recognition of absolute distance and obvious inadequacy in His presence. <I>Shabbat</I>, when viewed properly, is a singular and exclusive <I>ot</I> between <I>Kelal Yisrael</I> and Hashem because it is crucial to the multifaceted, ambitious agenda of the am <I>segulah</I>. At the same time, our assessment of <I>yetziat mitzrayim</I> undergoes serious revision when we contemplate Hashem's transcendence. The intimate participation and the mutuality-reciprocity of the relationship to <I>Kelal Yisrael</I> built on Hashem's <I>chesed</I>, but also <I>Kelal Yisrael's</I> <I>emunah</I> (faith)and <I>mesirut nefesh</I> (dedication-commitment) [ reflected in "<I>mishchu u-kechu lahem</I>"(<I>Shemot</I> )- <I>sheyischatu eloheichem le-einechim</I>"] is more surprising and therefore more impressive, certainly more fully appreciated, and also assumes greater religious significance in light of the awesome omnipotence implicit in Creation. If <I>yetziat mitzrayim</I> projects greater sensitivity to the personal, experiential aspects of religion and to the role of human destiny and potential, <I>maaseh bereishit</I> insures that man more fully appreciate and be humbled by that greater religious scope and opportunity inherent in serving Hashem both in his immanence and in his transcendence. </P>
<P>The integration of the two themes is expressed through the insertion of <I>zecher le-yetziat mitzrayim</I> in the <I>kiddush</I> of <I>Shabbat</I>, although primarily as a way of enhancing <I>zecher le-maaseh</I> <I>bereishit</I>. Its impact on <I>Shabbat</I>, notwithstanding a different primary emphasis, demonstrates its centrality to all of the <I>moadim</I>, where it is conveyed even in the <I>tefillah</I>. Perhaps the <I>gemara</I> in its presentation of the source of this conclusion seeks to underscore that the insertion of <I>zecher</I> <I>le-yetziat mitzrayim</I> into <I>Shabbat kiddush</I> draws not upon the second rendition of the <I>dibrot</I> where the link is internal to <I>Shabbat</I>, disentangled from <I>Pesach</I>, and in a context that de-emphasizes <I>zecher le-maasei bereishit</I>, but upon the full concrete experience of the actual exodus in the Pesachcontext designed to be most memorable (<I>Devarim</I> 16:3)- "<I>leman tizkor et yom tzeitchah mi-mitzrayim kol yemei hayecha</I>". Thus, it is intentionally derived specifically from the first rendition of <I>aseret ha-dibrot</I>, in which the commemoration of Creation is the exclusive focus (20:7-11) in order to demonstrate that its contribution is not a dilution, but an enhancement of that theme. </P>
<P>The Rambam (<I>Hilchot Chametz</I> 7:1) stresses this reciprocal link in the other direction, as well. In addressing the central theme of <I>sippur yetziat mitzrayim</I>, he finds it meaningful to invoke the <I>kiddush</I> of <I>Shabbat</I>. By doing so, he reminds us of the overwhelming impact of this experience, and perhaps also hints at the reciprocal impact of <I>zecher le-maaseh bereishit</I> on our precise evaluation of <I>sippur yetziat mitzrayim</I>. The reciprocal link intentionally focuses not on the more abstract and generally didactic mitzvah of <I>zechirat yetziat mitzrayim</I> (which according to the Rambam is a dimension of the <I>kabalat ol malchut shamayim of keriat shema</I>, as the Rav <I>zt"l</I> noted), but the more concrete, vivid, detailed and even visceral experience of the <I>sippur</I>. </P>
<P>The tie between <I>Shabbat</I> and <I>Pesach</I> may be reflected in other issues, as well. In one <I>pasuk</I>, <I>Pesach</I> itself is designated as "<I>Shabbat</I>" (<I>Vayikra</I> 23:11- regarding the <I>korban omer</I>). [Conceivably, only <I>Pesach</I> (and <I>Yom Kippur</I>, by virtue of its special bond with <I>Shabbat</I>) might qualify for this designation.] The <I>poskim</I> are perplexed about the origins and status of <I>Shabbat ha-Gadol</I>. Many argue that this special <I>Shabbat</I> commemorates the extraordinary standard of <I>emunah</I> exhibited by <I>Kelal Yisrael</I> in responding on <I>Shabbat</I>, the 10th of Nissan, to the challenge to ready "<I>seh le-beit avot seh la-bayit</I>" (<I>Shemot</I> 12:3), publicizing their intent to sacrifice the Egyptian deity. The <I>poskim</I> note that rarely, do we commemorate events by the day of the week, rather than the calendar day of the month. Why, then, do we always observe this important step in the process of <I>yetziat mitzrayim</I> on the <I>Shabbat</I> before <I>Pesach</I>? R. Levi ibn Haviv (<I>Chidushei Hagahot</I>, <I>Tur</I>, 430) suggests that the process began on <I>Shabbat</I> because <I>yetziat mitzrayim</I> was destined to play a crucial role in <I>Shabbat</I>! One might add that the reciprocal relationship of <I>Shabbat</I> and <I>Pesach</I>, and the mutually enhancing themes that are so strongly identified with them, made this truely a <I>Shabbat ha-Gadol</I>.</P>

<P>
In <EM>parshat Nezavim</EM>, which is generally 
designated to be read in advance of Rosh Hashanah, the Torah records several 
crucial sections that depict the highs and lows of the national destiny of the 
Jewish people- the devastating impact of sin, exile, loss and destruction 
(Devarim 29:19-27), and the equally impressive phenomenon of rebirth and return 
to prosperity and Divine providence (30:1-11). After this wide range culminates 
with a direct reference to <EM>teshuvah</EM> ("<EM>ki tashuv el Hashem Elokehah 
be-khol levavekhah u-bekhol nafshekhah</EM>"), the Torah (30:11-14) dramatically 
introduces an ambiguous <EM>mitzvah</EM>- "<EM>ki ha-mitzvah ha-zot</EM>"-, 
strikingly indicating that it is neither wondrous (<EM>nifleit</EM>) nor distant 
(<EM>rehokah</EM>), nor in the heavens ("<EM>bashamayim</EM>"), nor accross the 
sea (<EM>me-eiver la-yam</EM>). Rather, this unspecified imperitive is within 
our grasp- "<EM>befikhah ue-belevavkhah laasoto</EM>". The effect of the 
continuation, in which the Torah presents the choice of life and good or death 
and evil (30:15) is to convey urgency of implementation. Clearly a major 
principle of Judaism is being projected here, notwithstanding the ambiguity of 
the phrase "<EM>ki hamitzvah hazot</EM>
                                                                                                                                                                                "
</P><P>
While the <EM>gemara</EM> in <EM>Eruvin</EM> (55a) and 
Rashi (op.cit), and Rambam (<EM>hil. talmud torah</EM> 3:8) interpret this 
imperative as a reference to study of Torah, deemed as "<EM>keneged kulam</EM>" 
(Peah 1:1), the source for Jewish education and values, as crucial an 
institution as exists in Jewish life, the Ramban (30:11) suggests that the 
reference is to the obligation of <EM>teshuvah</EM>
                                                           -repentence.  His reading is reinforced by an analysis of the context and language of the previous sections, as noted.
</P><P>
The Ramban's view is consistent with prominence of 
<EM>teshuvah</EM> as vehicle for personal, communal, and national 
transformation. The Ravs perceived the very existence and possibility of 
<EM>teshuvah</EM>, the ability to extricate oneself from past behavioural 
patterns, and to neutralize sin and past inadequacy, to literally reinvent 
oneself, a philosophically problematic notion as it denies moral and behavioural 
causality, as a gift, even a miracle. This is particularly true of the more 
ambitious forms of <EM>teshuvah mi-yirah</EM> (fear of Hashem) and <EM>teshuvah 
me-ahavah</EM>
                                                                                     (love of Hashem) that have remarkable transformative impact on sin (Yoma 86a).  
</P><P>
Yet, <EM>teshuvah</EM> is a centerpiece in Jewish 
-<EM>halakhic</EM>
        outlook.  That man can and must mold his spirtual destiny is axiomatic, and particularly urgent in the period beginning with Rosh Hashanah and concluding with Yom Kippur (R. H. 18a).
</P><P>
An analysis of these pesukim according to Ramban's 
reading constitutes a blueprint for the process of <EM>teshuvah</EM>. It 
contributes significantly to our understanding of challenges and possibilities, 
and illuminates the process and methodology of this crucial 
institution-<EM>mitzvah</EM>. Before the <EM>yamim noraim</EM>
                                          , such an assessment is indespensible to our own personal and collective preparation for what lies ahead.
</P><P>
The first element is accessibiltiy (<EM>lo rehokah hi, 
befikhah ubelevavkhah laasoto</EM>), which is conveyed repeatedly and 
emphatically in these verses. Meiri begins his work on <EM>teshuvah</EM> 
(<EM>Hibbur ha-Teshuvah</EM>) by emphasizing the importance of not despairing in 
the quest for <EM>teshuvah</EM>. Being cognizant of our capacity to succeed not 
only dispels counterproductive frustration, but also reflects the nature of 
<EM>teshuvah</EM> and, by extension, of the <EM>halakhic</EM>
                                                                   concept of religious growth more generally as a meaningful challenge.
</P><P>
Furthermore, the Torah's intriguing formulations preclude 
and reject a decisive role for extraneous factors, while at the same time, they 
hint at the obstacles that need to but most definitely can be overcome. They 
also underscore that misguided or overstated nostalgia or overidealization of 
other eras or circumstances are generally counterproductive unless they inspire 
and motivate rather than frustrate by raising the bar to unattainable levels. In 
any case, a brief examination of what <EM>teshuvah</EM> is not is also 
indespensible to the effort to achieve a proper <EM>teshuvah</EM>
                                                                                          .  
</P><P>
The concept of "<EM>lo bashamayim</EM>" delcares that 
Judaism and by extension the process of <EM>teshuvah</EM> does not demand an 
angelic or other-worldly posture nor does it require perfection, either in deed 
or commitment. It is important to note that this verse is invoked by the Ravs 
in a celebrated passage (B.M. 59a -<EM>tanur shel akhnai</EM>) to establish the 
principle of man's partnership with God in the development of the 
<EM>halakhic</EM> system. The Talmud explains that precisely because of the 
perfection and self-sufficiency of the Torah given at Sinai, and due to its 
ambition for man's spiritual growth, there is no need for Divine intervention in 
<EM>halakhic</EM> decisionmaking. The tools and methodology of interpretation 
and adjudication are all part of the Torah, and man is charged with implementing 
that system through its Divinely ordained rules. The sincere <EM>halakhist</EM> 
who is properly trained in these rules, and who is fully committed to Torah and 
<EM>yirat shamayim</EM>, willing to surrendor to its rule and sensibilities, 
becomes a significant partner in the endeavor of Torah, making Divine 
intervention- <EM>lo bashamyim hi</EM>- unnecessary. The fact that the 
<EM>halakhist's</EM> sincere input is indespensible, even decisve, reflects 
Hashem's ambition for man, as well as the enormous responsibility that 
accompanies and is the basis for his prerogatives. Man's significant, if 
subordinate role in the world of <EM>halakhah</EM>, also constitutes a leitmotif 
in the writings and thinking of the Rav zt"l. Rav Soloveitchik contrasts 
<EM>halakhic</EM>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   man's creative contributions with the more generally passive posture of the admired- heroic figures of other religions.  This view reflects man's inherent value and potential for spirituality and sanctity.
</P><P>
This remarkable perspective attesting to man's vast 
potential qualifies man qua man (not as angel), as a candidate for the gift of 
<EM>teshuvah</EM>
                      .  Man need not relinquish his humanity to restore his relationship with Hashem.  Instead, he needs to elevate and sanctify his physical and human dimension and channel it to Hashem's service.  In Judaism, man is always superior to angels.  Because, not despite his humanity, he is privileged to have and observe the Torah.
</P><P>
The motif of "<EM>lo nifleit hi</EM>" is equally 
important. In his magnificent depiction of the uniqueness of <EM>halakhic</EM> 
Judaism, "<EM>Ish Halakhah</EM>", Rav Soloveitchik contrasts what he calls 
standard Religious Man and Halakhic Man. He demonstrates that unlike other 
religions, Judaism first and foremost focuses on concrete this-worldly norms and 
the sanctification of the real world, not on mysticism and the flight to a more 
spiritual realm. The process of <EM>teshuvah</EM>, by extension, is neither 
mysterious nor mystical. It is rooted in the accessible exoteric categories of 
the <EM>halakhah</EM>. Man's ability to sanctify the mundane and the physical 
world that he inhabits is the basis for <EM>berakhot</EM>, family laws like 
<EM>taharat mishpahah</EM>, as well as <EM>Choshen Mishpat</EM>, the 
comprehensive code of civil law that governs every aspect of human interaction. 
<EM>Halkahah's</EM> vast scope contrasts with other religions that focus almost 
exclusively on the more obvious "spiritual, ritual"sphere. The <EM>halakhic</EM>
                                                                                                                                                          approach reflects not compromise of spirituality, but the contrary a greater ambition  
</P><P>
In <EM>teshuvah</EM>, this consideration of "<EM>lo 
nifleit</EM>", is particularly acute. It is a crucial irony since sin reflects 
man's failure to attain his lofty goal, having succumbed to the pressures or 
temptations of the concrete world. Yet, in the process of <EM>teshuvah</EM>, man 
is not asked to reject the physical world, but to rededicate to the struggle and 
ambition to sanctify his existence and the world around him. <EM>Teshuvah</EM>
                                                                        is a rigorous, lengthy process, exoteric and human in every way.
</P><P>
At the same time, <EM>teshuvah</EM> is also not 
"<EM>me-eiver la-yam</EM>". <EM>Halakhah</EM> rejects a decisive normative role 
for the social-cultural environment in human behaviour. This is most certainly 
not due to a denial of its profound impact. Indeed, the concept of "<EM>shakhen 
ra</EM>" (bad neighbor-influence) and the admonition to avoid "<EM>moshav 
letzim</EM>" (clique of scoffers) etc. are pervasive and powerful themes in 
<EM>Chazal</EM> who were keenly sensitive to the power of environment and 
prevailing sensibilities and norms. Rather, it is a testament to the ability and 
obligation to overcome such negative influences, and to the dominant concept of 
personal responsibility, the foundation for all reward and punsishment. Personal 
choice (<EM>bechirah hafshit</EM>) stands at the center of <EM>teshuvah</EM>. 
(In Rambam's work it appears in the fifth and sixth of ten chapters dedicated to 
<EM>teshuvah</EM>!) According to the <EM>halakhic</EM> view, man has the 
capacity, and therefore the obligation to insulate himself from unacceptable 
attitudes and conduct, to extricate himself from or overcome his environment 
when necessary by strenthening his inner world that dictates his own responses, 
and when possible to help shape the world around him. See, Rambam, Sefer 
Hamitzvot, no. 3.] Yaakov indicated as much to his brother Esav when he declared 
that he was able to fulfill the 613 commandments in Lavan's home (Rashi, 
Vayishlah). He ultimately left that home when he felt Lavan's influence had 
became to intoxicating or confusing. Rav Soloveitchik often emphasized his 
belief that Judaism can thrive in any society with the proper <EM>yirat 
shamayim</EM>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    and level of commitment.  This conviction is predicated on the theme that Torah and its values are capable of fortifying one, providing a powerful foundation enabling man to meet his challenges.
</P><P>
The concept of "<EM>lo rehokah</EM>" encourages man to 
reject the sense of frustration and hopelessness due to the apparently 
overwhelming distance that separates him and Hashem, particularly as a 
consequence of sin. This feeling can impede the effort toward <EM>teshuvah</EM>
                                         .  The Torah perceives the formidability of the task as a catalyst for greater effort, as the experience of loss and distance underscores the inimical effects of sin.  Since man's purpose in the world is only to develop a relationship with Hashem, the sense of purposelessness and insignificance that results when he loses his spirtual bearings and anchor, must trigger his motivation to return.  
</P><P>
Finally, we turn from the challenge and misconceptions to 
the methdology. The words "<EM>befikhah u-belevavkhah laasoto</EM>" constitute a 
remarkable guarantee that, notwithstanding all of the misconceptions, which are 
really reflections of enormous challenges, <EM>teshuvah</EM> is within man's 
grasp and can be attained with nothing more than the basic core tools of his 
inner life. The first is the power of prayer through articulation. By virtue of 
a mechanism to reach Hashem and simultaneously achieve self- knowledge (from the 
reflexive "<EM>le-hitpalel</EM>"), man is able to place his needs and 
relationship to his Creator in better perspective. According to the Ramban, 
<EM>'befikhah</EM>" also refers specifically to the <EM>vidui</EM>- the 
confession stage that is indespensible to <EM>teshuvah</EM>, as it formulates, 
and concretizes man's failings, stripping away rationalization and denial, 
paving the path for honest introspection and ultimately, for change. The second 
component, "<EM>belevavekhah</EM>" projects the emotional-intellectual resources 
of heart and mind that can reshape and regulate man's inner world and dictate 
his hierarchy of values and priorities. Finally, "<EM>laasoto</EM>" establishes 
the role of actions that concretely implement the values of Torah through 
<EM>halakhic</EM> norms. The this-worldly nature of <EM>halakhic</EM>
                                                                                                                                                                                                  religious commitment alluded to earlier, which is not a concession to the physical world but  a reflection of higher spiritual ambition, demands that profound inner change be concretized into physical and measured actions that also impact upon others.
</P><P>
The promise of accessiblity of <EM>teshuvah</EM> and the 
deliniation of a well-defined program to achieve it does not dismiss, or ignore 
the challenges and obstacles, as noted. Moreover, the pesukim indicate that 
success is contingent upon the intensity of one's commitment. As the 
<EM>gemara</EM> in <EM>Eruvin</EM> and Rashi note, one need not storm the 
heavens, simulate conditions of "<EM>eiver layam</EM>", immerse oneself in 
esoteric study and mystical actions to attain the goal and gift of 
<EM>teshuvah</EM>, but one's devotion and dedication and conviction to religious 
self-improvement must match the intensity that would have been required had 
these radical, formidable standards been established as the sine qua non of 
<EM>teshuvah</EM>
                                                                                                               !  The gift of accessibility and attainablity should not be misconstrued or exploited as a license for a tepid or mediocre effort to achieve so crucial a goal.  
</P><P>
At the culmination of the <EM>teshuvah</EM> period, on 
Y.K., we withdraw temporarily from physical world, imitate the angels on high by 
standing and reciting the "<EM>barukh shem kevod malkhuto</EM>", etc. precisely 
to project the intensity of our commitment, our willingness to go to any lengths 
if they are demanded, and to project that our more balanced spiritual program 
springs from the same devotion that would have characterized a more ascetic and 
esoteric approach, and is just as passionate and tenacious. In this sense, 
"<EM>befikhah , belivavkhah, laasoto</EM>"'s simplicity does not bely the 
absolute comprehensiveness and ambitiousness of the task. The willingness to 
scale the heavens in our efforts to refashion our relationship with Hashem 
combined with the accessibility guaranteed by the Torah challenge and inspire 
each and every one of us to aspire for a complete <EM>teshuvah</EM> 
(<EM>sheleimah</EM>), as individuals and as a community in the <EM>yomim 
noraim</EM> period ahead. The multidimensional program outlined in the Torah is 
the blueprint for personal and collective introspection and transformation. May 
we achieve this goal- "<EM>ki hamitavah hazot befikhah ubelevavkhah 
laasoto</EM>
                                                                                                                                                                                     ".

<P>The paradigmatic<EM>mitzvah </EM>of Jewish parenting, combining rich experiential and deeply inspirational tradition with fundamental, and yet, profound, education is the <EM>hagadah</EM>. The word, "<EM>hagadah,"</EM> is based on the <EM>torah</EM>'s command, "<EM>V'higadta l'vincha bayom hahu leimor,"</EM><A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> "You shall tell your son on that day saying."</P>
<P>The <EM>Ohr Hachaim</EM><A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> asks a fundamental question. The first and last words of this five-word phrase seem contradictory. On the verse, <EM>"Koh somar l'veis ya'akov v'sageid livnei yisrael,</EM>"<A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>, <EM>Rashi</EM> quotes the <EM>Talmud</EM>, <A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>"<EM>Tomar b'lashon racah, vesageid--d'varim hakashin kegidin</EM>."</P>
<P>The verb, <EM>amar,</EM> means gentle language. The verb, <EM>higid,</EM> means harsh language. If so, <EM>v'higadeta leimor</EM> is an internal contradiction. Do we speak to our children harshly, <EM>v'higadta,</EM> or gently, <EM>leimor</EM>? The <EM>Ohr Hachaim</EM> suggests several answers. I would like to share with you a suggestion of my own.</P>
<P>In general society, the practices of which are often adopted by <EM>Torah</EM>-Jewry living in that time and place, two radically different methods of child raising exist. The first is disciplinarian. Children must be taught the rules and punished if they fail to keep them. In this way, the theory goes, they can achieve great things, as their potential is directed by wiser adults and not wasted on the foolishness of youth. This 19th Century attitude, captured in works by authors as varied as Charles Dickens and Mark Twain, views discipline as an end in itself, as the very essence of the upbringing of a proper, virtuous, and accomplished child.</P>
<P>Recently, an opposing theory has emerged. Discipline is terrible for a child's development and self-esteem. It stunts his ability to grow and achieve his potential, hence the term, "positive parenting," in which the word "no" is almost removed from the vocabulary. Children are to be persuaded that something is wrong, and not prevented forcibly from engaging in it. Misbehavior is handled by soft talk explaining that an action is wrong. There are no punishments, physical or otherwise.</P>
<P>In five immortal words, the <EM>Torah</EM> rejects both extremes. Parenting must begin with v'<EM>higadta,</EM> with the discipline of harsh words. Red lines must be drawn and a child who crosses them must be punished. A child who is never disciplined grows into an undisciplined adult, incapable of conforming even to the mores of general society, and certainly not to the more exacting norms<EM>of Torah u'mitzvos</EM>.
American neo-conservative thinkers have attributed many teenage social ills to unrestricted permissive parenting. These ills include drug abuse, sexual promiscuity, diminished attention span, and general underachievement. Apparently, children are not wise enough to set limits and develop their potential on their own.
In <EM>Torah</EM> society, in Israel and the United States, this type of education has led to the abandonment of <EM>Torah</EM> observance in great numbers of youth growing up in <EM>torah</EM> homes. Unrestricted exposure to modern general culture, given the twin developments of the decadence of society and the greater availability of modern media in the home and beyond, has overpowered the natural tendency of copying the lifestyle of the parents.
Does this mean that the <EM>Torah</EM> endorses the disciplinarian approach? After all, we know that many youngsters were brought up that way and became high achievers and upstanding Jews.</P>
<P>The answer is a resounding no, and for two reasons. First, such an upbringing stunts growth. In the short-term, it produces results: higher grades in school, better behavior at home and in <EM>shul</EM>. But in the long-term, such an education does not allow a child to do his own thing, to develop his unique talents and personality. </P>
<P>Second, such a <EM>chinuch</EM> carries a significant risk of rebellion. Perhaps, in earlier times, when we lived in a world of conformity, this risk was minimal. But now, a child who behaves and achieves because he is forced to do so may rebel as soon as the ability to force him is lost.
Is discipline an end in itself, enabling a parent to control a child's development, and brag of a high achieving, well-behaved child<EM>? Chas v'shalom!</EM> Discipline is only a prerequisite for the primary challenge of parenting- expressing love and warmth, sharing your innermost soul, talking gently and passionately about love of G-d, love of <EM>Torah</EM>, love of Israel, love of all creatures.
Yes, <EM>v'higadta</EM> is no more than a necessary prerequisite for the lifelong responsibility and opportunity of <EM>leimor</EM>, of teaching with love and by example, as the wondrous passage of one's children into adults takes place. In these five words, the <EM>Torah</EM> has taught the secret of successful Jewish parenting. Discipline your child only in order to teach him, gently and lovingly, for a lifetime. That is all. The rest is commentary.
Rav Shlomo Wolbe, <EM>sh'lit"a,</EM> wrote a book entitled "Planting and Building: Raising a Jewish Child,<A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>" which expresses similar ideas. When one builds, a precise architectural plan must be followed. There is no room for imprecision or improvisation. This represents the indispensable infrastructure of <EM>torah</EM> education. A child must be clearly taught: you may not do this, you must do that. All children must conform to the basics.</P>
<P>The essence of education, however, is planting, enabling a child to develop in his own way, to utilize his own strengths and character traits, to grow on his own. This is "<EM>chanoch lana'ar al pi darko</EM>,"<A HREF="#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> educate a child according to his own way. As the Vilna <EM>Ga'on</EM> comments, forcing a child against his nature, even if successful at first, is a recipe for unmitigated disaster.<A HREF="#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A><</P>
<P>Like planting, <EM>chinuch</EM> requires patience. When bringing up my own wonderful, sometimes-rambunctious children, of whom my wife and I are exceedingly, and I hope rightfully, proud, I would repeat over and over again - patience. Rav Wolbe's words, which we heard then on tape, confirmed this idea. "<EM>Chinuch hu litvach aruch"</EM> <EM>Chinuch</EM> is a long-range project. Punishment is a quick fix, but love is the only long-term option.</P>
<P>A word on spanking. The Talmud <A HREF="#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>prohibits spanking an older child, <EM>b'no gadol</EM>, based on v'<EM>lifnei iver lo sitein michshol.</EM>" <EM>Rashi</EM> explains that the child may rebel and sin, and the parent is responsible for that sin.<A HREF="#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P>
<P>The <EM>Shulchan Aruch</EM> <A HREF="#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A>quotes this <EM>halacha</EM>. The <EM>Rama</EM>,<A HREF="#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> based on a different passage in the <EM>Talmud</EM><A HREF="#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>, defines an older child as older than 22 or 24 years of age. This certainly strikes us as counterintuitive.</P>
<P>In fact, the <EM>Ritva</EM> <A HREF="#N_13_"><SUP>(13)</SUP></A>interprets <EM>gadol</EM> to mean 13, <EM>bar mitzvah</EM>, after which it is common that a youth will respond to a spanking by cursing or striking his parents, both capital offenses.</P>
<P>Rav Wolbe claims that today, striking a three-year old causes a <EM>michshol</EM>, a stumbling block, and is prohibited. In previous generations, children were more tolerant and had a more positive self-image, and were not damaged by spanking. Today, many children are damaged for life by spanking, especially since rebellion fills the air.</P>
<P>While this is a far-reaching and novel approach adopted in, and for, our times, a precedent exists in the words of the <EM>Ritva</EM>: "<EM>Lo gadol gadol mamash, elah hakol l'fi tiv'o she'yeish lachoosh sheyatris k'negdo b'dibur oh b'ma'asav, ki afilu lo y'hai bar mitzvah ein ra'ooy l'havi'o lidei makeh oh mekalel aviv, elah yishtadlenu bid'varim."</EM><A HREF="#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P>
<P>Even if a child is not <EM>bar mitzvah</EM>, if, because of his nature, there is a reasonable chance that he will rebel with words or deeds, and ultimately curse or strike his parent, it is prohibited to hit him. Rather, one must persuade him with words. Thirteen is simply an average age beyond which spanking may lead to rebellion and is, therefore, forbidden. If today the age is three, then that is the cutoff, as Rav Wolbe, says.</P>
<P>Let me conclude with an insight from Rav Simon Schwab, <EM>zt"l</EM><A HREF="#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>. The prohibitions against hitting and cursing parents, <EM>U'makei aviv v'eemo mos yumas--umkalel aviv v'eemo mos yumas,</EM> <A HREF="#N_16_"><SUP>(16)</SUP></A> are separated by the prohibition against kidnapping, <EM>v'gonev ish umcharo v'nimtza v'yado mos yumas</EM>.<A HREF="#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> Why?</P>
<P>Perhaps the <EM>Torah</EM> was anticipating the question - how can a child reach such a low level that he hits or curses his father? The answer is that the father continues to control his son by spanking or otherwise beyond the age of 22 or 24. In such a case, the father is effectively enslaving his son with intimidation. If so, he is considered one who stole a person, his own son, by denying his freedom of choice and action. This is the root cause of the son's tragic descent and rebellion to the point that he may hit or curse his father. The son is put to death, but the blame lies with the father.</P>
<P>On <EM>Shabbos Hagadol</EM>, when we read the <EM>Hagada</EM>, and on <EM>Pesach</EM>, when we focus on the mitzvah of <EM>v'higadta l'vincha</EM>, we must remember that the primary mode of <EM>chinuch</EM> is <EM>amira</EM>, talking softly and warmly to our children. May our best efforts to raise our children properly be blessed with success.</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: chanukah]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



 <p>The Talmud (Makkos 10a) teaches that man is assisted 
    and enabled from on High to follow the path that he chooses. This phenomenon 
    is a recurring theme in the story of Chanukah. </p>
  <p>Unlike Purim, where the threat against us was a physical one, the primary 
    threat at the time of Chanukah was against the spiritual component of our 
    people. Those willing to accede and accept Greek values were unaffected. The 
    Bach explains (Orach 
Chaim 670), that since the Jews were 
    lax in relating to the <i>Beis</i><i> 
Hamikdosh</i> and the <i>avodah</i> 
    (service) therein, they almost lost it. It was only when they repented and 
    demonstrated a seriousness of purpose and dedication to the <i>mikdash</i>, 
    showing the willingness to give their lives for it, did Hashem 
    respond in kind and return the <i>mikdash</i> to 
    them for another 200 years.</p>
  <p>Moreover, adds the Pnei 
Yehoshua (Shabbos 21b), the miracle 
    in the temple occurred through the menorah which our Ravs teach (
Shabbos 22b) is proof and testimony to the Jewish nation that 
    the <i>shechinah</i> - Hashem's 
    divine presence - dwells in their midst. In conjunction with the lighting 
    of the menorah we are taught (ibid) that the kohain 
    had to light but six of the seven lamps daily, because the <i>ner</i><i> 
    ma'aRavi</i>, the middle light, miraculously burnt 
    continuously. However, after the passing of Shimon Hatzadik 
    this light often went out. It was just at the time of Chanukah that the miracle 
    was restored to the menorah, demonstrating the return of His love for the 
    Jewish people. Hashem responded favorably to the 
    initiative of His people.</p>
  <p>Similarly, in conjunction with the very miracle of the oil, we are familiar 
    with the teaching that "<i>tuma</i><i> hutra 
    b'tsibur</i>"; if the majority of the Jewish nation 
    are in a sate of <i>tumah</i> (impurity), they may 
    use impure oil. The menorah could have been kindled without pure olive oil, 
    and yet the chashmonaim exhibited a great desire 
    and effort to only use the best quality oil. Once again, Hashem 
    responded in kind and enabled them to perform the mitzvah in the best way 
    possible.</p>
  <p>It is fascinating to note what specifically the Greeks opposed and sought 
    to uproot. We are taught in Megilas Antiochus that 
    they targeted <i>Shabbos</i>, 
<i>milah</i>, and <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>. 
    <i>Shabbos</i> and <i>milah</i> 
    are understandable targets, as they are each an os 
    - a sign of the covenant between Hashem and His 
    people. But what is so special about <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>?</p>
  <p>The <i>medrash</i><i> 
Shemos Rabbah</i> explains that 
    the reason <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> was the first mitzvah 
    given to the Jewish Nation as a people is, "<i>Yisroel</i><i> 
    Kedoshim M'kadshim</i>", 
    Israel the holy people has the capacity, and indeed the charge, to sanctify. 
    The mitzvah of the Jewish calendar and <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> 
    represents our ability to sanctify time. This ability is articulated in the 
    phrase "<i>mekadaish</i><i> yisroel 
    v'hazmanim</i>", which the Talmud in 
Berachos understands as saying that Hashem 
    sanctifies Israel, who in turn sanctifies 
    time. Milah (circumcision) is our sanctifying the 
    body, and Shabbos as well is our transcending time.</p>
  <p>The Greeks were offering the world a new cultured world order and weltanschauung. 
    They could accept the many understandable laws of Torah that could enhance 
    society. However, they saw man and his gratification, pleasure, and enjoyment 
    as the ultimate end. It is for this reason that they so strongly fought the 
    opposing ideology of <i>kedusha</i> - the call of 
    the Jew to sanctify. They could accept the quantitative difference between 
    B'nai Noach with their 
    seven <i>mitzvos</i> and 
<i>B'nai</i><i> Yisroel</i> with 
    its six hundred and thirteen. However, they could not accept the qualitative 
    difference that our <i>mitzvos</i> are not merely 
    rituals to be observed, but "<i>asher</i><i> 
kidshanu b'mitzvosov</i>" - the 
    commandments sanctify.</p>
  <p>It is thus understandable why they did not destroy the temple, but as we 
    recite in Ma'oz Tzur - 
    "<i>ufortzo</i><i> chomos 
    migdalai</i>" - "they breached the walls of 
My citadel." This refers, as we are taught in the 
mishna (Middos 
    2:3) to a wooden partition known as the <i>soreg</i> 
    which was ten <i>tefachim</i> (approximately thirty 
    eight inches) high. The Greeks made thirteen breaches in the 
<i>soreg</i>. The Gra explains that 
    this partition marked the location beyond which a non-Jew could not go. The 
    Greeks could not accept this division and separation. To them, we are all 
    the same, and there is to be no <i>havdala</i> (separation) 
    "<i>bain</i><i> Yisroel 
    l'amim</i>" (between Israel and the rest of society).</p>
  <p>Again, Hashem responded in kind. As we stood our 
    ground in defense of kedushas 
<i>Yisroel</i> (the sanctity of Israel) we were rewarded with a <i>mitzvah</i> which enables 
    us to create more <i>kedusha</i>. The lighting of 
    
<i>ner</i> Chanukah is in essence bringing more holiness into 
    this world. A moment before the kindling you have a cup of oil or a candle. 
    Now once lit as a designated Chanukah light, "<i>hanairos</i><i> 
    ha-la-lu kodesh 
haim</i>" - these lights are holy, and we are restricted in 
    using them in any manner. We fought for <i>kedusha</i> 
    and He rewarded us with a mitzvah that generates more <i>kedusha</i> 
    annually. May we always be privileged to enable Him to reward us with more 
    
<i>kedusha</i>.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: sefira]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> (<I>Orach Chaim</I> 493:1) teaches that the custom is not to marry until the thirty third day of the <I>Omer</I>, for during this time the students of Rabi Akiva died. The source of this teaching is the Talmud <I>Yevamos</I> (62b) that states that Rabi Akiva had 12 thousand pairs of disciples and they all died during one period, because they did not treat each other with respect. The Talmud further informs us that they died between <I>Pesach </I>and <I>Shavuos</I>.</P>

<P>I was always troubled by the charge of "they did not treat each other with respect". Does it mean they did not say "good morning" to one another? Intuitively we sense there is more going on. Commenting on the verse (<I>Breishis</I> 25:1), "Avraham proceeded and took a wife whose name was Ketura", the <I>Medrash Rabbah</I> (61:3) quotes the teaching of <I>Koheles</I> (11:6), "in the morning sow your seed and in the evening do not be idle, for you cannot know which will succeed; this or that or whether both are equally good." Rabi Yishmael understood the above verse to mean that if one was privileged to study Torah in his youth he should continue to learn Torah is his old age as well, for one can never be sure of the accuracy of their understanding of Torah. Moreover, Rabi Akiva, inspired by the verse in <I>Koheles,</I> taught that if one was privileged to have many students in their youth, they should continue and have disciples in their old age. Rabi Akiva, upon losing his 12 thousand pairs of students, proceeded to teach Torah to seven students, who later perpetuated the study of Torah for all time. Rabi Akiva addressed his later students and said, "My sons, my earlier students died as '<I>aynayhem tzara ailu l'ailu'</I> - they begrudged and resented one another. Be especially careful not to emulate their misdeeds."</P>

<P>"Tsoras Ayin" is usually understood in the physical materialistic realm. Too often, one is not happy with the success and accomplishments of the next one. They are bothered that the next person has what they do not. The Medrash is shedding light on the students' lack of respect for one another, namely their resentment of each others spiritual growth and accomplishments. Ideally, "<I>kinas sofrim tarbeh chocma</I>" (Bava Basra 21a)- "Jealousy between scholars increases wisdom". One should say to himself, if that individual can <I>daven</I> with <I>kavana</I>, abstain from talking during <I>davening</I>, have regular <I>s'dorim</I> with a <I>chavrusa</I>, learn <I>daf yomi</I>, visit the sick, participate in <I>chevra kadisha</I>, and abstain from <I>lashon hara</I>, then so can I!</P>

<P>There is a classic case in Talmud <I>Sanhedrin</I> (102a) where we are taught that despite the many atrocities of Yarovam, hashem seized him by his garment and said to him, "Repent, and I, you and the son of Yishai will stroll together in the Garden of Eden." Thereupon, Yarovam said to Hashem, "<I>Mi b'rosh</I> ?"- Who will lead the procession? Hashem answered that David would be at the head. Yarovam replied that he was not going. Among other things, Yarovam had <I>tzoras ayin</I> towards David. That Hashem should recognize David's spiritual accomplishments over Yarovam's was something he could not tolerate. Not only was he not happy and proud of David's success, but his wishing it were not so was a form of diminution of Hashem's honor and glory that David's <I>avodah</I> (spiritual growth) had accomplished. This strong condemnation of that <I>tzoras ayini </I>is expressed by Rabbeinu Yonah in <I>Shaarei Teshuvah</I> (3:160). He says that though an individual may be a <I>talmid chacham</I>and <I>shomer mitzvos</I> if he begrudges the success of his colleagues he is termed a <I>sonei Hashem</I> - one who shows some hatred toward Hashem. </P>

<P>The Talmud (Sanhedrin 93b) delves into the psyche of King Saul and concludes that when Doeg informs Saul that "Hashem is with him," (Samuel I 16:18) this means that David was the recipient of special Divine assistance, as witnessed by the fact that his views and opinions were established as the accepted halacha. Immediately Saul became disheartened and jealous of David. Saul suffered from <I>tzoras ayin</i>!</P>

<P>This is the very antithesis of Aharon HaCohen. Moshe was afraid to accept the leadership position in <I>Bnei Yisroel</I> lest he offend his older brother Aharon. Hashem assures Moshe (<I>Shmos 4:14), "</I>v'racha v'somach b'libo<I>," - </I>when (Aharon) sees you he will rejoice in his heart. Aharon posessed  '<I>tov ayin</I>' - a good eye, genuinely happy with the mission and accomplishments of Moshe. <I>Mishle</I> (22:9) teaches, "One with a good eye will be blessed," and Aharon was the beneficiary of his generosity of spirit by receiving the breastplate of the <I>Cohen Gadol</I> upon his generous heart.</P>

<P>This very critical lesson is one that we all need to learn and master. It is not only for the great among our people, as the malady has precipitated the downfall of prestigious institutions of learning. All too often this negativism is found in homes and synagogues. Case in point: A young man or woman attends a yeshiva in Israel post-high school. They attain success in their learning and often return with a more serious attitude and demeanor towards their personal spirituality. They now actually recite blessings before eating, recite <I>birkas hamazon</I> slowly from a text, and come to shul on time. They find time in their schedule for daily learning of Torah, and <I>chessed</I> activities. How is this received by their families? Is it encouraged and viewed through the lenses of <I>tov ayin</I>? Is it <I>nachas</I> for a parent to see their child advance beyond their own personal station? Or, is it met with mocking  and sarcastic gestures and language, often a reaction based on feelings of guilt and inadequacy?</P>

<P>Yaakov, in his departing words to Shimon and Levi says, "<I>ki v'apam hirgy ish</I>" (<I>Bereishis </I> 49:6), translated literally as, 'for in their rage they murdered people'. Our wise among us were quick to note that <I>af</I> also means 'nose'. Sometimes with only a facial gesture, a turning up of the nose, we can do immeasurable damage to the effect of a speaker's words, and the positive advances of a spiritual journey. No one said the time of <I>sefirah</I> was easy!</P>

<P>Many an inspirational talk in Yeshiva halls (<I>sichas musar</I>) have invoked the opening Rashi of <I>Bechukosai</I>, making it part of the lexicon of expressions of the Jewish people. Typically, Rashi aims to resolve the seeming redundancy of the first <I>Pasuk</I>, "If you will follow my laws and observe my commandments and do them". Interpreting the first phrase to mean "<I>Shetiheyu ameilim baTorah</I>" - that you should toil and extend unmeasured efforts in the study of Torah - we are thus assured peace, prosperity and pride if we invest ourselves in the study of Torah with the purpose of maintaining and observing <I>mitzvos</I>. Once again, at the parallel text introducing the actual <I>tochecha</I>, where Hashem prepares us for some of the worst moments of our past, Rashi reminds us that all of that came to be, because our spiritual lives unRaveled starting with the lack of "<I>ameilus batorah</I>". </P>
<P>These comments of Rashi pose several questions worth pondering. Is it possible that our national fortune depends on what we have come to see as the experience of a stage of life or at most a small segment of our people? In other words, how can the total immersion in study become the test for people who due to circumstances may only be able to spend small parts of one's day in Torah study? Further, how does Rashi see in the phrase "If you will walk with my laws" a reference to being absorbed by Torah study?</P>
<P>A careful look shows us that Hashem chose the word "<I>chok</I>" rather than <I>mishpat</I> or <I>mitzva</I> to express "laws". Additionally, Hashem chose "if you will walk" rather than "observe" or "do" to express the required action. Why this choice of words? The term "<I>chok</I>" usually denotes laws whose reasons have been hidden from us, and thus our allegiance to them is a testament to our acceptance of a higher authority of infinitely greater wisdom. "Walking" connotes a consistent activity which will lay claim to some goal or destination. Thus the "<I>ameilus</I>", the investment referred to, is the unstinting dedication to a source of wisdom far beyond ourselves. Let's explain. </P>
<P>It seems to me that there are two forms or sources of <I>ameilus</I> which are indeed shared by all those who study, irrespective of station in life or whether one has eighteen hours a day or several hours a week. </P>
<P>The intense effort to understand a text or an idea is rooted in the unabiding trust we have in the depth of Torah ideas that emanate from Hashem. Because of this trust, we are sure that when we delve into Torah insights will emerge. In other words, the commitment to the observance of "<I>chok</I>" also pushes us to investigate Torah. </P>
<P>Additionally one can make great investment and effort through an ongoing, i.e. "walking", schedule of learning.</P>
<P>One can now well understand that pursuit of study is the ultimate test of our observance and hence the focus of our <I>parsha</I>.</P>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<I><P>"And the benei yisrael saw [it] and they said to each other "man hu ['its food!' or 'what is it!?']" as they did not know what it was, and Moshe said this is the bread that Hashem has given you to eat.(Shemos 16:15)</P>
<P>"And the nation rested on the seventh day. And the House of Israel named it "man" and it was like a white gad seed, and it tasted like honey pastry." (16:30-31) </P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P>The "<I>dor deah</I>", the desert generation that is forever revered for the intimacy which they were privileged to have with Hashem, became entrusted with the task of naming their food, gifted daily from Hashem Himself. Surely you and I would have thought of something clever that would speak of the gift that it was, the love that it expressed, the <I>parnassah</I> that it assured or the nourishment that it provided. Yet this generation who had reached the highest levels of knowledge could find no more a creative label than "man". Despite its pearly presentation, honey like sweetness, and fresh as dew packaging, they called it "food" according to Rashi or "whatchamacallit" according to Rashbam and Ohr Hachayim. </P>
<P>Furthermore, the sequence of events requires comment as well. Why does the Torah choose to record the name of this desert food immediately after the Torah mentions that we observed <I>shabbos</I>?</P>
<P>Perhaps the "<I>dor deah</I>" understood that we can get used to almost anything, even food appearing out of thin air, every day, in time to feed each family and restock the empty shelves of all homes. Accordingly, in a possible attempt to protect us from taking the "<I>man</I>" for granted, they tried to capture for all times to come, the excitement of those first few moments when it was new and totally unexpected. It was just then that "they said to each other '<I>man hu'</I> ", which the K'sav sofer interprets as each one wanting so share his unique "<I>man</I>" experience, its singular taste and no doubt some personal insight as well. "<I>Man</I>" will forever remind us of "<I>man hu</I>" and those first few moments when they had no words to fully express or describe what they saw. </P>
<P>It is also quite possible that only after they had lost the "<I>man</I>" for a <I>shabbos</I>, that they come to appreciate it anew and ponder life without it. They then may have felt the urgency to establish appropriate reminders to assure that we would never become jaded about all that Hashem provides for us.</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: noach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>
            The sweet fragrance accorded to the animal sacrifices 
that Noach brought to mark his exit from the <EM>teivah</EM> presumably 
announced Hashem's happiness with those sacrifices and probably indicated that 
they were an auspicious start to the new world that Noach would build. How 
fascinating it was, therefore, to find the <EM>medrash</EM> (Raba 34:10) 
describe the fragrance as nothing other than "the scent of destruction". Afraid 
that we would mistakenly conjure up the smell of waste and destruction left 
behind by the receding flood waters and associate that with these sacrifices, 
the <EM>medrash</EM> continues with a parable. We  are asked
            to view Hashem's reaction similar to that of a  king planning
            the construction of a beautiful seaside palace. Searching
            for the precise location, the king chooses, from amongst
            all the possible views and conveniences,  the place where he
            chanced upon an attractive and apparently powerful odor.
</P><P>
            This medrash  certainly should leave us quite puzzled.  What
            is the sweet odor of destruction and desolation?  Does it in
            any way resemble the fragrance of the sacrifices of years
            later that are indeed referred to with the same phrase?  It
            would certainly be surprising to see emptiness and waste in
            the solemn introspection of a sin offering or the attendant
            gratitude of a sinner seeing an animal take his place on the
            altar. Furthermore, the  parable teaches us that Noach's
            sacrifice convinced Hashem of  the vitality of the world
            that He would build through the efforts of Noach and family,
            but leaves us on our own to connect the dots.
</P><P>
               Clearly, it would not be hard for us
            to imagine Noach emerging from the flood as a
            cynical survivor overwhelmed with doubts of the value in rebuilding the
            world that had failed and crumbled to nothing in several
            months. How else can one feel with friends, home,&nbsp;indeed all of what
            commonly lends structure and familiarity to life, simply washed away
            to nothingness.
</P><P>
            Yet it is my generation that witnessed, perhaps like none
            other, an altogether  different kind of survivor as well.
            We saw people with enormous dedication to the past and
            incredible commitment to a bright future that would be mixed
            with indescribable pain.   Indeed we grew to know survivors
            that were determined not to be the link that failed, and
            felt the responsibility that assured their eminent success.
</P><P>
            Thus the sacrifice that showed that Noach emerged with
            belief that was strengthened rather that strained, and
            shoulders that were broad and youthful rather than shaken
            and aged, gave rise to the bitter sweet smell of
            destruction.  Out of  his loneliness arose a sense of unique
            responsibility for G-d's world and a sense of purpose that
            was bold and defiant.
</P><P>
            Perhaps the medrash instructs us further to appreciate why
            the Torah describes the expanding family of Noach as an
            introduction the subsequent  disappointing sequence of
            events(9:18-21).  Noach becomes a "man of the earth" only
            after his chlidren had inhabited many countries, and the
            future of the world no longer was entirely dependant on him.
</P><P>
                With the pressures of being a lone
             survivor well behind him, the fragrance of the vitality and
            vigor that often results from&nbsp;desolation began to fade,&nbsp;as did those who were
            so  clearly  commissioned to build the royal seaside palace.
</P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>That Yehoshua's name was instrumental in distinguishing him and maintaining him true to our national mission is certainly intimated in the text. Yet exactly how his name helped is debated in the <I>midrashim</I>. Rashi quotes that Yehoshua's name carried his Rebbe's prayer that Hashem should save him from the counsel of his colleagues. It requires little imagination to appreciate the efficacy of any Rebbe's prayer and ever so more when Moshe <I>Rabeinu</I> is the Rebbe. However the <I>medrash</I> which tracks the new "<I>yud</I>" that was added to Hoshea to make him Yehoshua and finds one that has floated for several centuries, ever since it was dropped from Sarah our Matriarch, does require comment. True, Sarah was Sarai and she lost her '"<I>yud</I>" presumably, to mark her ascension to universal contribution and recognition, just as the "<I>heh</I>" did for Avraham. Yet her connection to Yehoshua and the mission of the <I>meraglim</I> and how that would give direction to Yehoshua, is not at all clear. </P>
<P>Addressing this question, HaRav Nisan Alpert <I>zt"l</I> suggests that Yehoshua's mission both as a spy and ultimately as the conqueror of <I>Eretz Yisrael</I> would forever have to be informed with the passion of Sara's commitment to our land. Sarah made the painful and forever unpopular demand of her husband to send Yishmael away "as he cannot inherit together with my son Yitzchak". It was Sarah, a matriarch looking far into the future, who first expressed with resolve and clarity that Yitzchak and Yishamel could not be partners in Israel. Unfortunately it is no longer surprising that it would take the understanding of a mother and the insight of a prophetess to unabashedly establish for us our singular relationship to our land. Indeed Avraham in his "<I>eishes chayil</I>" eulogy for Sarah recognizes for "having sought wool and linen", as if to say she understood that which would contribute fully, only when left undiluted by combination. </P>
<P>Undoubtedly the passion of Sarah will drive Yehoshua the general to push the conquest with might and vigor, but how will it make a difference for Yehoshua the scout? How will this <I>yud</I> borrowed from Sarah strengthen him to withstand the pressure of colleagues with a vastly different perception?</P>
<P>Perhaps it is not coincidental that it is the small <I>yud</I> which connects Yehoshua to Sarah's vision. The role of the "<I>yud</I>" in Hebrew, as we all know from our youth, is that it connotes personal possession. <I>Shulchan</I> refers to any table; <I>shulchani</I> is my table; <I>eretz</I> is any land and <I>artzi</I> is my land. Thus Moshe was reminding Yehoshua that he must view the land as his very own and in that which is yours you will see only good. This is reminiscent of one of life's truths formulated in the Talmud as "<I>chen hamakom al yoshveho</I>". Loosely translated, this means that whatever you call home will hold a charm for you that will often leave others totally mystified. It is true about our hometown; it is true about our homes and backyards; it most certainly is true for all that we have come to call home. Indeed possession is nine tenths of perception. </P>

<P>
            Seemingly slow and at a pace which would appear to be
            disappointing, the redemptive process of which we pray we are
            a part moves along.  Thus is it not quite comforting to be
            assured in this week's "edition" of the seven weeks of
            comfort following the three weeks, that we are in fact on
            course, as planned.  The words of Yeshaya rise to a climax
            as we close (52:12), "You will not leave in a rush nor will
            you go  in flight for Hashem will go before you and Hahsem
            will gather you in."
</P><P>
            It is almost as if Yeshaya warns us not to expect a 
replay of <EM>Yetzias Mitzrayim</EM>, described at the end of last week's 
<EM>Parsha</EM> (16:3) and whose rushed exodus we are all asked to remember. 
Though it is not clear, and subject to discussion who was doing the rushing, it 
will not happen this time around. The Americans won't push us as the 
<EM>Mitrayim</EM> did
            when they were finally brought to their knees;  nor will we
            run in fear of a window of opportunity that may close; nor
            will Hashem push us in fear of us falling into the lowest
            level of tuma .
</P><P>

            How different then is the description of Malachi (3:1) of
            what we believe to be the same period,  "Suddenly The L-rd
            whom you seek  will come to his Sanctuary".
</P><P>
            Are we to take comfort in the words of Yeshaya and see 
ourselves well in the <EM>geulah</EM> process or continue to wait for the ball 
of fire to come? Is it going to be "<EM>lo bechipazon</EM>" or 
"<EM>pis'om</EM>"?  Are we to watch the zig zag course with many
            ups and downs or train ourselves to patiently yearn for
            something indescribable and convincing beyond question?
</P><P>
            Apparently the words of Yeshaya and Malachi will both 
become fulfilled. Perhaps we will witness <EM>geulah</EM> move with all
            its spurts and stops only to be fully realized with a sudden
            climactic revelation?
</P><P>
            Indeed this makes much sense in light of a comment of Rav 
Yaakov Moshe Charlop. He suggests in his comments to <EM>Bamidbar</EM>, that our 
lapses in those years were all because we moved at a pace that was faster than 
humans are able to absorb. There he opines in a manner reserved for our greatest 
souls, that having being pushed out of <EM>mitzrayim</EM> our sense of independence and responsibility had not
            matured.  We were physically free but emotionally all too
            ready to head back at the smell of trouble.
</P><P>
            The gradual step by step <EM>geula</EM>
                  will prepare our hearts and
            our minds while the spectacular will leave us no room to
            question what has happened.  It will be sudden and fantastic
            but we will be a people ready to grow spiritually even as we
            will relish our freedom to govern and to direct our destiny.
</P><P>
            I don't think this paradox should come as a surprise. 
<EM>Klal Yisroel</EM> lives this apparent contradiction every <EM>Ellul</EM>. 
The sounding of the <EM>shofar</EM> on <EM>Rosh Hashana</EM> is according, to 
Rambam, to stir the sleeping souls and shock us into introspection and self 
examination. Yet <EM>Klal Yisroel</EM> starts sounding the alarm and 
<EM>ledovid</EM> today and will soon begin the <EM>selichos</EM>. Apparently 
only the soul well prepared through the month of <EM>Ellul</EM> will let the 
<EM>shofar</EM> through, allowing its message to make a lasting to impact.</P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are only four of them in all of <I>Chumash</I> with one in <I>Parshas Tzav</I> and they are as unique in sound as they are in meaning.  Yet of all them, the "<I>shalsheles</I>" of this weeks <I>parsha</I> is the most intriguing.  This "<I>ta'am hamikra</I>", the longest musical note that accompanied the text from Sinai, is associated with struggle, dissonance and tension.  Probably we are guided to see it just that way due to its very first appearance in the Torah (<I>Breishis19</I>:15).  There the Torah explicitly describes the inner struggle that Lot endures as he is being coaxed to leave Sodom by the very angels that were sent to fetch him. In onomatopoeic form, "and he hesitated" is sung with a <I>shalsheles</I> drawing out the word as much as possible. Rashi further  explains that facing the loss of all his material wealth that he must leave behind gave Lot great pause and he had to be forcibly pulled away from his house.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <I>salsheles</I> next appears in (<I>Breishis</I> 24:12) the prayer offered by Eliezer, pleading with <I>Hashem</I> for clarity and direction in choosing a wife for Yitzchak. Here <I>chazal</I> have told us that indeed this mission was a test of his loyalty to Avraham and his children. How Eliezer, having imbibed the practices and thoughts of Avraham <I>Avinu</I> for a lifetime, would have loved  Yitzchak for a son in law!  Thus his prayer was one of the penitent who knew with his mind what he should say and yet his heart was in another place altogether.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yosef <I>Hatzadik's</I> refusal to comply with the advances of Potifar's wife are marked with the third <I>shalsheles</I> (<I>Breishis</I> 39:8). Here too, <I>chazal</I> understand that a struggle raged in the heart of Yosef, one not at all apparent from the text itself.  The manner and intensity of the woman's interest that conceivably could win him freedom and place him close to fulfilling his dreams created unbearable duress. As we know, it was only the vision of his father reminding him of the greatness that lay ahead that doused the fires from within.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of this makes it so hard to understand the <I>shalsheles</I> of <I>Parshas Tzav</I> (8:23).  Moshe is preparing the ram that will complete the consecration services of the <I>Mishkan</I>. After this <I>korban</I>, Aharon will take over and Moshe will return to the role of a Levi and of course of national leader.  It was only during those initiating seven days that Moshe was allowed to do the <I>avoda</I> of Aharon.  Why the <I>shalsheles</I>?  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No doubt Moshe was very conflicted about these <I>korabnos</I>. On one hand the <I>Mishkan</I> was about to be established and the redemption reach its zenith.  The rift that the sin of the golden calf introduced was about to be mended for all to see and the availability of the <I>shechina</I> for our prayers was about to descend.  Yet for Moshe personally this <I>korban</I> brought home that he would never again have the privilege to serve in the <I>Heichal</I> and to bring various <I>korbanos</I>. The <I>shalsheles</I> reminds us of that pain that he must have felt at losing the opportunity for these <I>mitzvos</I>. </P>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>Parshat Matot begins in an unusual fashion <I>- "Vayedaber Moshe el roshei ha-matot le-Benei Yisrael leimor</I>" - as Moshe addresses the leadership of <I>Benei Yisrael</I> regarding the laws of <I>nedarim</I> without having been explicitly directed to do so. In a famous passage, Rashbam (Bamidbar 30:2) relates that he was asked if the Torah ever records a similar initiative by Moshe <I>Rabbeinu</I>. He and other <I>mefarshim</I> (Ibn Ezra, Seforno etc.) struggle to find hints to these <I>halachot</I> in previous <I>parshiyot</I> in an effort to demonstrate that Moshe was merely implementing Hashem's direct, if subtle, mandate. Other <I>mefarshim</I> (Rashi, Ramban, Tur, Or Hachayim etc.) are troubled by the apparently central role of the <I>roshei matot</I> in this context. These <I>halachot</I>, after all, apply also to all of <I>Klal Yisrael</I>. The Ramban even suggests that the Torah was reticent to publicize these <I>halachot</I> lest they be abused, and, thus, addressed the leadership exclusively! He and others also note the special role of the <I>chacham yachid mumcheh</I> in the process of <I>hatarat nedarim</I> to justify this emphasis. Or Hachayim posits that the more prominent role of the <I>roshei matot</I> in this <I>parsha</I> is designed to balance the impression gleaned from the fact that larger population was given priority in the assembling call of the <I>chatsotserot</I>. </P>
<P>Rashi's position is particularly enigmatic. On the one hand, he suggests that the emphasis in this <I>parsha</I> on the <I>roshei matot</I> indicates that they received these <I>halachot</I> first as an expression of special regard and respect for their role. At the same time, he indicates that this procedure was routine in Moshe's transmission of the Torah to <I>Klal Yisrael</I>! He then proceeds to raise the obvious problem: why does the Torah underscore this hierarchy of conveying the <I>halacha</I> specifically in this context? He concludes that the Torah's unusual formulation establishes that in the absence of a <I>chacham</I>, 3 commoners can function to exempt from the commitment of <I>nedarim</I>. The commentators note that Rashi's response is problematic since the <I>chacham's </I>emphasized role is actually being demonstrated not to be exclusive and indispensable! </P>
<P>Perhaps these anomalies can be better understood when we consider the nature of <I>nedarim</I> and the role of the <I>chacham</I> in that context. Elsewhere (<A href="../../1999/parsha/rros_matot.html">TorahWeb, Matot, 1999</a>), we have developed the idea that the very concept of <I>nedarim</I> reflects the transcendence of <I>halachic</I> values and categories, and is a testament to the notion of a binding <I>halachic</I> reality. The Torah allows man to play a role in expanding his <I>halachic</I> world through the mental and verbal commitment embodied by <I>nedarim</I>, and even recognizes the objective stature of that which has been fashioned in this manner as <I>issurei chefzah</I>, in the case of <I>nedarim</I>. The role of the <I>chacham</I>, as the responsible interpreter but also occasionally the architect of the ideal <I>halachic</I> world is captured dramatically by his leading role in determining the binding nature of these special <I>halachic</I> commitments. The Tur (Bamidbar 30:2, based on R. H. 6a) explains the Torah's emphasis by projecting the idea that the <I>chachamim</I> have a special responsibility to enforce the implementation of <I>nedarim</I>. The Keli Yakar (Bamidbar 30:3) argues that the role of the <I>chacham</I> in giving dispensation for <I>nedarim</I> flows from an implicit condition attached to every <I>neder</I>- that it achieve Ravnic approbation! This idea dramatizes the pervasive role of Ravnic leadership in all of Jewish life, as <I>nedarim</I> constitute an important expression and notable expansion of the <I>halachic</I> -spiritual realm. Undoubtedly, it is no coincidence that Ravnic tradition is particularly central in the very development of these <I>halachot</I>, as "<I>nedarim porchin ba-avir ve-ein lahem al mah she-yismochu</I>" (Chagigah 10a -there is little Biblical textual basis for the details of <I>nedarim</I> and <I>shavuot</I>). Indeed, some of the <I>mefarshim</I> (Or Hahayim) cite this phenomenon as one of the reasons that the <I>roshei matot</I> play such a crucial role in this <I>parsha</I>. Moreover, <I>Chazal</I> (Nedarim 9a, 22a) generally discouraged the masses from undertaking <I>halachic</I> commitments, but viewed this expansion of <I>halachic</I> life by <I>chachamim</I> in positive light (Midrash Rabbah, beg. of Matot). </P>
<P>At the same time, it should be emphasized that the role of the <I>chacham</I> in <I>nedarim</I> is neither judicial nor is it legislative. Rather it is the integrity and judgement drawing upon general spiritual stature that qualifies the <I>chacham</I> to assess and rule on the validity of vows and commitments. The <I>chacham</I>'s authority in this realm derives not from specific knowledge or powers, but from the fact that he is singularly attuned to the totality of the <I>halachic</I> system. Indeed, the fact that in his absence, a <I>chacham</I> can be replaced by a court of three attests to the more general basis for his authority. The <I>yachid mumcheh</I> in this context does not embody the authority of a court of three; it is the court of three that substitutes for the more ideal presence of the <I>yachid mumcheh</I>. For this reason, relatives can serve together on the court of three, as the primary legal category is not that of a <I>beit din</I>, but of a collective wisdom-stature in lieu of the presence of a genuine <I>chacham</I>. </P>
<P>It is conceivable, then, that Rashi intended to convey that the basis for Moshe's hierarchical procedure in communicating Torah to <I>Klal Yisrael</I> generally is reflected dramatically by the special function of the <I>chacham</I> in <I>nedarim</I>. For this reason, the Torah specifically records that the <I>roshei matot</I> were the initial recipients of this <I>parsha</I>. Moreover, the wider role and intuition of the <I>chacham</I> is further reflected specifically in the context of <I>nedarim</I> by the impression that Moshe took personal initiative in relating this <I>parsha</I> without a specific directive from Hashem. It matters little whether Moshe's action was rooted in hints he gleaned from previous communications with Hashem, or based on a broader understanding of his charge. In any case, the broader function of the <I>chacham</I>, the significance of his being attuned to the total system of <I>halachah</I>, made his initial and ongoing role in the <I>halachic</I> process indispensable to a system that was to be self-sufficient and dynamic, a true <I>torat chayyim</I> based on the notion that "<I>torat Hashem temimah</I>". The initial communication to <I>roshei matot</I> was not indicative of an elitist perspective on <I>talmud torah</I> and <I>halacha</I>, but was actually designed to enhance the accessibility of Torah and the quality of its reception by <I>Klal Yisrael</I> by emphasizing its breadth and by projecting the crucial contribution of the <I>chachamim</I> in this dynamic. The fact that the context of <I>nedarim</I> also reflects the alternative of a <I>beit din</I> of three commoners does not diminish the role of the <I>chacham</I>, but actually enhances this theme, as it accents the <I>chacham</I>'s centrality even in a non-judicial and legislative context.</P>

<P>
In <EM>parshat Nezavim</EM>, which is generally 
designated to be read in advance of Rosh Hashanah, the Torah records several 
crucial sections that depict the highs and lows of the national destiny of the 
Jewish people- the devastating impact of sin, exile, loss and destruction 
(Devarim 29:19-27), and the equally impressive phenomenon of rebirth and return 
to prosperity and Divine providence (30:1-11). After this wide range culminates 
with a direct reference to <EM>teshuvah</EM> ("<EM>ki tashuv el Hashem Elokehah 
be-khol levavekhah u-bekhol nafshekhah</EM>"), the Torah (30:11-14) dramatically 
introduces an ambiguous <EM>mitzvah</EM>- "<EM>ki ha-mitzvah ha-zot</EM>"-, 
strikingly indicating that it is neither wondrous (<EM>nifleit</EM>) nor distant 
(<EM>rehokah</EM>), nor in the heavens ("<EM>bashamayim</EM>"), nor accross the 
sea (<EM>me-eiver la-yam</EM>). Rather, this unspecified imperitive is within 
our grasp- "<EM>befikhah ue-belevavkhah laasoto</EM>". The effect of the 
continuation, in which the Torah presents the choice of life and good or death 
and evil (30:15) is to convey urgency of implementation. Clearly a major 
principle of Judaism is being projected here, notwithstanding the ambiguity of 
the phrase "<EM>ki hamitzvah hazot</EM>
                                                                                                                                                                                "
</P><P>
While the <EM>gemara</EM> in <EM>Eruvin</EM> (55a) and 
Rashi (op.cit), and Rambam (<EM>hil. talmud torah</EM> 3:8) interpret this 
imperative as a reference to study of Torah, deemed as "<EM>keneged kulam</EM>" 
(Peah 1:1), the source for Jewish education and values, as crucial an 
institution as exists in Jewish life, the Ramban (30:11) suggests that the 
reference is to the obligation of <EM>teshuvah</EM>
                                                           -repentence.  His reading is reinforced by an analysis of the context and language of the previous sections, as noted.
</P><P>
The Ramban's view is consistent with prominence of 
<EM>teshuvah</EM> as vehicle for personal, communal, and national 
transformation. The Ravs perceived the very existence and possibility of 
<EM>teshuvah</EM>, the ability to extricate oneself from past behavioural 
patterns, and to neutralize sin and past inadequacy, to literally reinvent 
oneself, a philosophically problematic notion as it denies moral and behavioural 
causality, as a gift, even a miracle. This is particularly true of the more 
ambitious forms of <EM>teshuvah mi-yirah</EM> (fear of Hashem) and <EM>teshuvah 
me-ahavah</EM>
                                                                                     (love of Hashem) that have remarkable transformative impact on sin (Yoma 86a).  
</P><P>
Yet, <EM>teshuvah</EM> is a centerpiece in Jewish 
-<EM>halakhic</EM>
        outlook.  That man can and must mold his spirtual destiny is axiomatic, and particularly urgent in the period beginning with Rosh Hashanah and concluding with Yom Kippur (R. H. 18a).
</P><P>
An analysis of these pesukim according to Ramban's 
reading constitutes a blueprint for the process of <EM>teshuvah</EM>. It 
contributes significantly to our understanding of challenges and possibilities, 
and illuminates the process and methodology of this crucial 
institution-<EM>mitzvah</EM>. Before the <EM>yamim noraim</EM>
                                          , such an assessment is indespensible to our own personal and collective preparation for what lies ahead.
</P><P>
The first element is accessibiltiy (<EM>lo rehokah hi, 
befikhah ubelevavkhah laasoto</EM>), which is conveyed repeatedly and 
emphatically in these verses. Meiri begins his work on <EM>teshuvah</EM> 
(<EM>Hibbur ha-Teshuvah</EM>) by emphasizing the importance of not despairing in 
the quest for <EM>teshuvah</EM>. Being cognizant of our capacity to succeed not 
only dispels counterproductive frustration, but also reflects the nature of 
<EM>teshuvah</EM> and, by extension, of the <EM>halakhic</EM>
                                                                   concept of religious growth more generally as a meaningful challenge.
</P><P>
Furthermore, the Torah's intriguing formulations preclude 
and reject a decisive role for extraneous factors, while at the same time, they 
hint at the obstacles that need to but most definitely can be overcome. They 
also underscore that misguided or overstated nostalgia or overidealization of 
other eras or circumstances are generally counterproductive unless they inspire 
and motivate rather than frustrate by raising the bar to unattainable levels. In 
any case, a brief examination of what <EM>teshuvah</EM> is not is also 
indespensible to the effort to achieve a proper <EM>teshuvah</EM>
                                                                                          .  
</P><P>
The concept of "<EM>lo bashamayim</EM>" delcares that 
Judaism and by extension the process of <EM>teshuvah</EM> does not demand an 
angelic or other-worldly posture nor does it require perfection, either in deed 
or commitment. It is important to note that this verse is invoked by the Ravs 
in a celebrated passage (B.M. 59a -<EM>tanur shel akhnai</EM>) to establish the 
principle of man's partnership with God in the development of the 
<EM>halakhic</EM> system. The Talmud explains that precisely because of the 
perfection and self-sufficiency of the Torah given at Sinai, and due to its 
ambition for man's spiritual growth, there is no need for Divine intervention in 
<EM>halakhic</EM> decisionmaking. The tools and methodology of interpretation 
and adjudication are all part of the Torah, and man is charged with implementing 
that system through its Divinely ordained rules. The sincere <EM>halakhist</EM> 
who is properly trained in these rules, and who is fully committed to Torah and 
<EM>yirat shamayim</EM>, willing to surrendor to its rule and sensibilities, 
becomes a significant partner in the endeavor of Torah, making Divine 
intervention- <EM>lo bashamyim hi</EM>- unnecessary. The fact that the 
<EM>halakhist's</EM> sincere input is indespensible, even decisve, reflects 
Hashem's ambition for man, as well as the enormous responsibility that 
accompanies and is the basis for his prerogatives. Man's significant, if 
subordinate role in the world of <EM>halakhah</EM>, also constitutes a leitmotif 
in the writings and thinking of the Rav zt"l. Rav Soloveitchik contrasts 
<EM>halakhic</EM>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   man's creative contributions with the more generally passive posture of the admired- heroic figures of other religions.  This view reflects man's inherent value and potential for spirituality and sanctity.
</P><P>
This remarkable perspective attesting to man's vast 
potential qualifies man qua man (not as angel), as a candidate for the gift of 
<EM>teshuvah</EM>
                      .  Man need not relinquish his humanity to restore his relationship with Hashem.  Instead, he needs to elevate and sanctify his physical and human dimension and channel it to Hashem's service.  In Judaism, man is always superior to angels.  Because, not despite his humanity, he is privileged to have and observe the Torah.
</P><P>
The motif of "<EM>lo nifleit hi</EM>" is equally 
important. In his magnificent depiction of the uniqueness of <EM>halakhic</EM> 
Judaism, "<EM>Ish Halakhah</EM>", Rav Soloveitchik contrasts what he calls 
standard Religious Man and Halakhic Man. He demonstrates that unlike other 
religions, Judaism first and foremost focuses on concrete this-worldly norms and 
the sanctification of the real world, not on mysticism and the flight to a more 
spiritual realm. The process of <EM>teshuvah</EM>, by extension, is neither 
mysterious nor mystical. It is rooted in the accessible exoteric categories of 
the <EM>halakhah</EM>. Man's ability to sanctify the mundane and the physical 
world that he inhabits is the basis for <EM>berakhot</EM>, family laws like 
<EM>taharat mishpahah</EM>, as well as <EM>Choshen Mishpat</EM>, the 
comprehensive code of civil law that governs every aspect of human interaction. 
<EM>Halkahah's</EM> vast scope contrasts with other religions that focus almost 
exclusively on the more obvious "spiritual, ritual"sphere. The <EM>halakhic</EM>
                                                                                                                                                          approach reflects not compromise of spirituality, but the contrary a greater ambition  
</P><P>
In <EM>teshuvah</EM>, this consideration of "<EM>lo 
nifleit</EM>", is particularly acute. It is a crucial irony since sin reflects 
man's failure to attain his lofty goal, having succumbed to the pressures or 
temptations of the concrete world. Yet, in the process of <EM>teshuvah</EM>, man 
is not asked to reject the physical world, but to rededicate to the struggle and 
ambition to sanctify his existence and the world around him. <EM>Teshuvah</EM>
                                                                        is a rigorous, lengthy process, exoteric and human in every way.
</P><P>
At the same time, <EM>teshuvah</EM> is also not 
"<EM>me-eiver la-yam</EM>". <EM>Halakhah</EM> rejects a decisive normative role 
for the social-cultural environment in human behaviour. This is most certainly 
not due to a denial of its profound impact. Indeed, the concept of "<EM>shakhen 
ra</EM>" (bad neighbor-influence) and the admonition to avoid "<EM>moshav 
letzim</EM>" (clique of scoffers) etc. are pervasive and powerful themes in 
<EM>Chazal</EM> who were keenly sensitive to the power of environment and 
prevailing sensibilities and norms. Rather, it is a testament to the ability and 
obligation to overcome such negative influences, and to the dominant concept of 
personal responsibility, the foundation for all reward and punsishment. Personal 
choice (<EM>bechirah hafshit</EM>) stands at the center of <EM>teshuvah</EM>. 
(In Rambam's work it appears in the fifth and sixth of ten chapters dedicated to 
<EM>teshuvah</EM>!) According to the <EM>halakhic</EM> view, man has the 
capacity, and therefore the obligation to insulate himself from unacceptable 
attitudes and conduct, to extricate himself from or overcome his environment 
when necessary by strenthening his inner world that dictates his own responses, 
and when possible to help shape the world around him. See, Rambam, Sefer 
Hamitzvot, no. 3.] Yaakov indicated as much to his brother Esav when he declared 
that he was able to fulfill the 613 commandments in Lavan's home (Rashi, 
Vayishlah). He ultimately left that home when he felt Lavan's influence had 
became to intoxicating or confusing. Rav Soloveitchik often emphasized his 
belief that Judaism can thrive in any society with the proper <EM>yirat 
shamayim</EM>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    and level of commitment.  This conviction is predicated on the theme that Torah and its values are capable of fortifying one, providing a powerful foundation enabling man to meet his challenges.
</P><P>
The concept of "<EM>lo rehokah</EM>" encourages man to 
reject the sense of frustration and hopelessness due to the apparently 
overwhelming distance that separates him and Hashem, particularly as a 
consequence of sin. This feeling can impede the effort toward <EM>teshuvah</EM>
                                         .  The Torah perceives the formidability of the task as a catalyst for greater effort, as the experience of loss and distance underscores the inimical effects of sin.  Since man's purpose in the world is only to develop a relationship with Hashem, the sense of purposelessness and insignificance that results when he loses his spirtual bearings and anchor, must trigger his motivation to return.  
</P><P>
Finally, we turn from the challenge and misconceptions to 
the methdology. The words "<EM>befikhah u-belevavkhah laasoto</EM>" constitute a 
remarkable guarantee that, notwithstanding all of the misconceptions, which are 
really reflections of enormous challenges, <EM>teshuvah</EM> is within man's 
grasp and can be attained with nothing more than the basic core tools of his 
inner life. The first is the power of prayer through articulation. By virtue of 
a mechanism to reach Hashem and simultaneously achieve self- knowledge (from the 
reflexive "<EM>le-hitpalel</EM>"), man is able to place his needs and 
relationship to his Creator in better perspective. According to the Ramban, 
<EM>'befikhah</EM>" also refers specifically to the <EM>vidui</EM>- the 
confession stage that is indespensible to <EM>teshuvah</EM>, as it formulates, 
and concretizes man's failings, stripping away rationalization and denial, 
paving the path for honest introspection and ultimately, for change. The second 
component, "<EM>belevavekhah</EM>" projects the emotional-intellectual resources 
of heart and mind that can reshape and regulate man's inner world and dictate 
his hierarchy of values and priorities. Finally, "<EM>laasoto</EM>" establishes 
the role of actions that concretely implement the values of Torah through 
<EM>halakhic</EM> norms. The this-worldly nature of <EM>halakhic</EM>
                                                                                                                                                                                                  religious commitment alluded to earlier, which is not a concession to the physical world but  a reflection of higher spiritual ambition, demands that profound inner change be concretized into physical and measured actions that also impact upon others.
</P><P>
The promise of accessiblity of <EM>teshuvah</EM> and the 
deliniation of a well-defined program to achieve it does not dismiss, or ignore 
the challenges and obstacles, as noted. Moreover, the pesukim indicate that 
success is contingent upon the intensity of one's commitment. As the 
<EM>gemara</EM> in <EM>Eruvin</EM> and Rashi note, one need not storm the 
heavens, simulate conditions of "<EM>eiver layam</EM>", immerse oneself in 
esoteric study and mystical actions to attain the goal and gift of 
<EM>teshuvah</EM>, but one's devotion and dedication and conviction to religious 
self-improvement must match the intensity that would have been required had 
these radical, formidable standards been established as the sine qua non of 
<EM>teshuvah</EM>
                                                                                                               !  The gift of accessibility and attainablity should not be misconstrued or exploited as a license for a tepid or mediocre effort to achieve so crucial a goal.  
</P><P>
At the culmination of the <EM>teshuvah</EM> period, on 
Y.K., we withdraw temporarily from physical world, imitate the angels on high by 
standing and reciting the "<EM>barukh shem kevod malkhuto</EM>", etc. precisely 
to project the intensity of our commitment, our willingness to go to any lengths 
if they are demanded, and to project that our more balanced spiritual program 
springs from the same devotion that would have characterized a more ascetic and 
esoteric approach, and is just as passionate and tenacious. In this sense, 
"<EM>befikhah , belivavkhah, laasoto</EM>"'s simplicity does not bely the 
absolute comprehensiveness and ambitiousness of the task. The willingness to 
scale the heavens in our efforts to refashion our relationship with Hashem 
combined with the accessibility guaranteed by the Torah challenge and inspire 
each and every one of us to aspire for a complete <EM>teshuvah</EM> 
(<EM>sheleimah</EM>), as individuals and as a community in the <EM>yomim 
noraim</EM> period ahead. The multidimensional program outlined in the Torah is 
the blueprint for personal and collective introspection and transformation. May 
we achieve this goal- "<EM>ki hamitavah hazot befikhah ubelevavkhah 
laasoto</EM>
                                                                                                                                                                                     ".

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: tezaveh]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<I><P>Parshat Tezaveh</I> delineates the fashioning of various garments that the <I>kohen gadol</I> must wear in order to carry out his duties in the <I>Beit ha-Mikdash</I>. Perhaps the most intriguing component of his eight-piece wardrobe is the golden <I>tzitz</I> crown(Shemot 28:36-38; 29:6; 39:30-31), which is actually not even a garment, but merely an adornment (<I>tachshit</I>) (Sukah 5a). It is, after all, this <I>tachshit</I> that bears the powerful yet mysterious message of "<I>kodesh la-Hashem</I>". While some commentators (Rashbam 28:36) insist that this phrase refers also to the ephod and hoshen, and others argue that it applies to the entire <I>bigdei kehunah</I> (Meshekh Hakhmah 28:36), the fact that these words are not only written but engRaved upon the <I>tzitz</I>, is surely significant. Moreover, only this element of <I>bigdei kehunah</I> contributes directly to the effectiveness of the <I>korbonot</I> (see Rashbam, op. cit). The <I>tzitz</I> neutralizes the disqualifying factor of <I>tumah</I> (defilement) at least with respect to those ingredients of the <I>korban</I>- the blood, <I>kemitzah</I>, and <I>eimurim</I>- that are offered directly on the <I>mizbeach</I> (see Pesachim77a, 81a, Menachot 25a). The <I>midrash</I> (Tanchumah on Bamidbar 31:6) simply identifies "<I>kelei ha-kodesh</I>" as the <I>tzitz</I>. It is striking that the Torah in <I>parshat Pekudei</I> (39:30-31) concludes its report of <I>Kelal Yisrael's</I> compliance with the mandate to develop the various implements of the <I>mishkan</I> and <I>avodah</I> by indicating that the <I>tzitz</I> had, indeed, been properly fashioned. The Netziv (Haamek Davar, 39:31) notes that the reference to the <I>tzitz</I> in this context appears out of order with respect to the other <I>begadim</I> relative to the original charge. He explains that the Torah begins and ends its inventory <I>Kelal Yisrael's</I> accomplishments with the two most important creations-contributions, the <I>aron</I>, and the <I>tzitz</I>! The <I>tzitz</I> clearly emerges as a crucial component in the <I>avodah</I>. What accounts for the symbolic and substantive import of this simple ornament? </P>
<P>Perhaps its significance lies precisely in its simplicity, and in the unambiguous, yet ambitious character of the message, <I>kodesh la-Hashem</I>, that it bears. Precisely because it seems self-evident that the entire purpose and structure of the <I>avodat ha-korbonot</I> is Divine sanctification, it is possible that the necessary focus of attention on the <I>halachically</I> complex issues of detail and implementation might obscure that basic truth, threatening to undermine the entire enterprise. Furthermore, as the Ramchal notes in his famous introduction to the Mesillat Yesharim, it is often the most basic truths that we ignore and abuse precisely because we presume their self"-evidence. Certainly with respect to the high stakes and special opportunity inherent in the <I>avodah</I>, the Torah demands that the self- evident is still insufficient. It is possible that this motif also demands an exclusive and purist motivation. Ulterior or additional motives are inconsistent with the purist, ideal world of the <I>avodah</I>. [The link between this issue and the need for "<I>lishmah</I>" requires further discussion.] </P>
<P>In any case, given these perspectives, it is unsurprising that the simple, yet powerful theme of "<I>kodesh la-Hashem</I> needs to be omnipresent. It is the visible crown(<I>nezer</I>) to the whole <I>avodah</I> enterprise that must be a constant (28:38<I>)-"ve-hayah al mizho tamid le-razon lahem lifnei Hashem</I>". An analysis of its very designation, "<I>tzitz</I>", confirms this theme. The midrash, and numerous commentators ranging from ancient to modern times (Torah Shelemah, Rashbam, Rav Hirsch), links this term with the verse "<I>meitzitz min hacharakim"</I> (Shir ha-Shirim 2:9) to convey that the visibility of this ornament and its engRaved message is indispensable to its function both as <I>bigdei kehunah</I> and as a means of facilitating <I>korbonot</I>, even neutralizing potential obstacles to <I>kapparah</I>, such as <I>tumah</I>. Indeed, one perspective (Yuma 7b; Menachot 36b) demands constant awareness of the presence of the <I>tzitz</I>. The <I>kohen gadol</I> is obligated to exercise total concentration, excluding any minor distraction (<I>hesech ha-daat</I>). </P>
<P>The demanding themes that underpin the <I>tzitz</I>, also provide for flexibility in the bringing of sacrifices, as long as and because this ideal has not been fundamentally contRavened. Thus, the simple yet powerful theme of "<I>kodesh la-Hashem</I>" facilitates the bringing of defiled <I>korbonot</I>. It is interesting that more subtle violations like <I>pigul</I>, <I>notar</I> and <I>yotzei</I> cannot be sanctioned or rectified by means of the <I>tzitz</I> (Menahot 25a). It is possible that this is due to the fact that these circumstances always reflect improper input or initiative, ulterior motivations, and a disrespect for the boundaries of "<I>kodesh la-Hashem</I>" (See R. Hirsch, 28:36). They contradict the very foundation upon which <I>ritzui tzitz</I> stands. Similarly, while their is a <I>halachic</I> consensus that <I>ritzui tzitz </I>is effective with respect to blood, <I>kemitzah</I>, and <I>eimurim</I>, all of which are totally consumed by the <I>mizbeach</I>, and thus unequivocally absolutely dedicated to <I>Hashem</I>, the impact of the <I>tzitz</I> on the meat of the <I>korbon</I> whose status is more complex as it is also consumed by the <I>kohanim</I>, is subject to debate. With the possible exception of <I>tumat tehom</I>, which can't be identified in advance, the <I>tzitz</I> does not sanction flaws connected with the improper status of the functioning <I>kohen</I> (See, also, Rav Hirsch's explanation of this phenomenon.). </P>
<P>The <I>tzitz</I> is a particularly apt crown for the <I>kohen gadol</I> whose very persona and function mirrors the ideal of a total dedication to <I>Hashem</I> that is unequivocal and on constant display. The Torah establishes that the <I>kohen gadol</I> continues to serve even as an <I>onen</I>- "u-min ha-mikdash lo yeitzei". Radvaz (<I>hil. kilayim</I> 10:32) explains that the <I>kohen gadol's</I> absolute dedication to <I>avodat Hashem</I> dictates that even personal grief be set aside in favor of his public spiritual duties. According to some interpretations, Rambam distinguishes between regular <I>kohanim</I> and the <I>kohen gadol</I>, permitting only the latter to don his vestments while he is not actually involved in the <I>avodah</I> (<I>hil. keli ha-mikdash</I> 8:12; <I>hil. kilayim</I> 10:32). The rationale that is sometimes advanced is that the <I>kohen gadol</I> is always perceived as involved in the <I>avodah</I>. Perhaps the continuing impact of the <I>tzitz</I> and the theme of the exclusive focus of the <I>avodah</I> that it projects contribute to this <I>halachic</I> condition, as well. [Of course, this issue is linked to the debate between R. Yehudah and R. Shimon- Yoma 7b.] The fact that the <I>kohen gadol</I> presides over the entire range of the <I>avodah</I> of <I>Yom Kippur</I>, the day of "<I>kulo la-Hashem</I>", encompassing both the daily <I>tamid</I> as well as the singular entrance into the <I>kodesh ha-kodoshim</I>, reinforces this theme. [Of course, the <I>tzitz</I> is not included in his <I>bigdei lavan</I>, but understandably it may be superfluous in that context.] Indeed, R. Abraham b. Harambam suggests that the expression "<I>kodesh la-Hashem</I>" itself refers also to the <I>kohen gadol</I> who bears the message! </P>
<P>While the actual <I>tzitz</I> adorns only the <I>kohen gadol</I> and its direct function and impact is limited to the <I>avodah</I>, the theme of <I>kodesh la-Hashem</I> and the broader ideal it conveys extends to all Jews. <I>Chazal</I> linked the <I>tzitz</I> to the <I>tefillin</I> that play such a crucial role in our daily life. The <I>gemara</I> (Zevachim 19a) establishes that the <I>tefillin</I> of the <I>kohen gadol</I> was to be placed between the <I>tzitz</I> and <I>mitznefet</I>. Moreover, the <I>gemara</I> (Menachot 36b) derives the need for constant vigilance and involvement with the <I>tefillin</I> and the exclusion of any kind of distraction (<I>hesech ha-dat</I>) based on the paradigm of the <I>tzitz</I>. [In fact, the Rambam only records this consideration in the context of <I>hil. tefilin</I> (4:14). The exact character of this relationship is complicated. See Tosafot Yoma 8a s.v. <I>u-mah</I> and Shaagat Aryeh, no. 38.] The Meshech Chochmah (28:36) tries to demonstrate that the <I>tzitz</I> constitutes the equivalent of <I>Hashem's tefilin</I> (based on Berakhot 6b). </P>
<P>In fact, the <I>tzitz</I> in symbol and substance embodies both in its themes of ambition and exclusivity the special reciprocal relationship between <I>Hashem</I> and <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>. It is no surely no coincidence that <I>Chazal</I> explicitly limit the actual sanctioning and appeasing (<I>ritzui</I>) impact of the <I>tzitz</I> to <I>Kelal Yisrael </I>(Zevachim 45a). At the same time, <I>Chazal</I> (Yevamot 60b) establish that the <I>tzitz</I> is linked to the punishment of those enemies, like the <I>benot midyan</I>, who try to corrupt <I>Kelal Yisrael</I>, by diluting that ideal commitment, thereby creating a rift between <I>Hashem</I> and his people. Or ha-Hayim (28:37) connects "<I>kodesh la-Hashem</I>" to the verses in Jeremiah (2:3)-"<I>kodesh yisrael la-Hashem, reishit tevuatah</I>". He explains that the ideal of the <I>tzitz</I> characterizes the unique bond between <I>Am Yisrael</I> and <I>Hashem</I>, differentiating us from all other nations. </P>
<P>The multiple associations of <I>"kodesh la-Hashem</I>" defining the simple, yet powerful foundation of the <I>avodah</I>, the <I>kohen gadol</I>, and the reciprocal relationship of <I>Kelal Yisrael</I> and <I>Hashem</I> continue to be a source of inspiration and ambition. It does, in fact, constitute an omnipresent crown- "<I>nezer hakodesh</I> (29:6; 39:30) "<I>al mizho tamid</I>"(28:38) that adorns our spiritual life. May we merit that our commitment to this theme continue to be received "<I>lerazon lahem lifnei Hashem</I>" (28:38). </P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: kisavo]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[





   
<P>
The <EM>mitzvah</EM> of 
<EM>bikurim</EM> requires an individual to designate the first fruit of his 
labor (i.e. <EM>hafrasha</EM>) and to subsequently bring them to the <EM>beis 
hamikdosh</EM> (i.e. <EM>hava'ah</EM>). The Rambam maintains (Sefer Hamitzvos, 
<EM>mitzvas asseh</EM> 125) that these two elements, <EM>hafrasha</EM> and 
<EM>hava'ah</EM>, comprise a single <EM>mitzvah</EM>. Rabbeinu Sadyah Gaon, 
however, disagrees and treats <EM>hafrasha</EM> and <EM>hava'ah</EM> as two 
separate <EM>mitzvos</EM> (<EM>mitvas aseeh</EM> 81 and 84). 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, this dispute seems to parallel the views 
of the Rambam and Ramban regarding the obligation of <EM>terumah</EM>. Whereas 
the Ramabm sees <EM>hafrasha</EM> and <EM>nesina</EM>, designating and giving 
<EM>terumah</EM> to the kohein as a single <EM>mitzvah</EM> (<EM>mitzvas 
asseh</EM> 126), the Ramban counts <EM>hafrasha</EM> and <EM>nesina</EM> as two 
separate <EM>mitzvos</EM> (<EM>shoresh</EM> 12).
</P>
<P>
The view of the Ramban, however, is not at all identical 
to the position of Rav Sadyah Gaon. The Ramban explains that <EM>hafrasha</EM> 
is independent of <EM>nesina</EM>, for through <EM>hafrasha</EM> one removes the 
prohibition of <EM>tevel</EM>. This reasoning which most certainly applies to 
<EM>terumah</EM> and <EM>challah</EM>, does not apply to <EM>bikurim</EM>, which 
is not linked to the prohibition of <EM>tevel</EM>.
</P>
<P>
Although the Rambam combines the elements of 
<EM>hafrasha</EM> and <EM>hava'ah</EM>, he nonetheless treats <EM>mikra 
bikurim</EM>, the profound declaration of gratitude to Hashem, as an independent 
<EM>mitzvah</EM> (<EM>mitzvas asseh</EM> 132).
</P>
<P>
The primacy and importance of <EM>bikurim</EM> is evident 
in a striking medrash. Rashi, commenting on the opening <EM>pasuk</EM> of 
<EM>Braishis</EM>, explains "<EM>bishvil haTorah shenikrais raishis darko</EM>" 
- the world was created for the Torah which is called the beginning of His way - 
"<EM>ubishvil Yisroel shenikra raishis tevuaso</EM>" - and for Yisroel which is 
called the first of His crop. The medrash adds "<EM>v'ein raishis ela bikurim, 
d'ksiv 'raishis bkurei admaschem</EM>'" - "the beginning" refers to bikurim, the 
choicest first fruit of your land. In what sense, however, is <EM>bikurim</EM> a 
<EM>mitzvah</EM> in whose merit the world was created?
</P>
<P>
Rav Asher Weiss explains that this perplexing medrash can 
be understood based on the stunning comments of the Ramban (end of Parshas Bo), 
"v'ein <EM>keil elyon chafets b'tachtonim milvad she'yeida ha'adam v'yodeh 
l'elokav she'bra'av</EM>" - Hashem, the Most High, has no demand on the lower 
creations except that man should know and be thankful to Hashem for having 
created him. <EM>Hava'a</EM> and <EM>mikra bikurim</EM> reflect these two 
imperatives - <EM>she'yeida v'yodeh</EM>. By offering his first fruits, 
<EM>hava'a</EM>, man demonstrates that <EM>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</EM> is indeed the 
supreme creator, <EM>borai hakol</EM>. Through <EM>mikra bikurim</EM>, one 
declares profound gratitude, recognizing <EM>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</EM> as the 
guide of our history and destiny. The mitzvah of <EM>bikurim</EM> reflects our 
challenge and mandate <EM>she'yeidah v'yodeh</EM>. In this merit the world was created.</P>

<P>The Midrash Rabba, at the beginning of <I>Bamidbar</I>, explains that the Torah was given to <I>Bnai Yisroel</I> with "<I>aish umayim</I>" (fire and water). <I>Mayim</I>, our <I>chachamim</I> assert, represents <I>shiflus</I> (humility), as they explain: "<I>ma mayim manichin b'makom gavoa, v'holchin l'makom namuch, af divrei torah ainam mikaymin ela b'mi she'da'ato shefeila</I>" - just as water leaves a higher level and goes to a lower level, so too the words of Torah are retained only by one who is humble. <I>Aish</I> (fire), however, which is constantly ascending, represents the confidence and assuredness of one who pursues Torah.</P>
<P>At once, we are challenged to balance the characteristics of <I>aish</I> and <I>mayim</I>. Balancing the statement of Avraham Avinu, "<I>anochi affar v'eiffer</I>" (<I>Braishis</I> 18:27) "I am but dust and ash", and the teaching of the <I>mishna</I> Sanhedrin (4:5) "<I>l'fichach kol echad chayav lomar bishvili nivra</I> <I>ha'olam</I>" - the conviction that the whole world was created for me.</P>
<P>Rav Asher Weiss explains that the sin of the <I>meraglim</I> (spies) and the rebellion of Korach <I>va'adaso</I> mark tragically improper applications of these <I>middos</I> (character traits).</P>
<I><P>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</I> had promised and assured us of the successful conquest of <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>. The <I>mergalim</I> were called upon to embrace the <I>middas ho'aish</I> (trait of fire), to reflect confidence and conviction. Tragically, they felt dwarfed and humbled by the inhabitants of Canaan. "<I>Vayehi b'ainenu k'hagavim, v'chein hayinu b'aineihem</I>" (<I>Bamidbar</I> 13:33), "And we were as grasshoppers in our eyes and so we were in their eyes"; one must show the <I>middas ho'aish</I>  and faithfully implement the <I>ratson Hashem</I> (will of Hashem). </P>
<P>Suddenly, with improper confidence and arrogance, Korach <I>va'adaso</I> challenge Moshe <I>rabbeinu</I> - "<I>ki kol ho'eida kulam</I> <I>kedoshim u'b'tocham Hashem</I>" (<I>Bamidbar</I> 16:3) ("for the entire congregation is holy, and Hashem is among them"). In the presence of Moshe and Aharon, one must adopt <I>middas</I> <I>ha'mayim</I>, deference and humility.</P>
<P>How different our history would have been had <I>Bnai Yisroel</I> internalized the confidence of <I>middas ho'aish</I> when confronting the <I>ummos Ha'olam</I> (nations of the world), and the <I>middas ha'mayim</I> in the presence of Moshe and Aharon.</P>
<P>We too must carefully balance these <I>middos</I>. When confronting the challenges of the outside world do so with the confidence of <I>middas ho'aish</I>. Internally, however, and especially in the presence of <I>gedolei umanhigei yisroel</I> embrace the humility of <I>middas ha'mayim</I>. </P>

		<content><![CDATA[



  <p>One of the  traits that the Torah attributes to 
    Noach and Avraham is that of "<i>temimus</i>," 
    or completeness. Noach is referred to as a "<i>tzaddik</i><i> tamim</i>," a 
    righteous, complete person. Avraham is commanded, 
    "<i>hishalech</i><i> lefanai veheye tamim</i>," walk in front of Me and be complete. Furthermore, 
    the Torah tells us in Parshas Shoftim, "<i>tamim</i><i> tihyeh im Hashem 
    Elokecha</i>," be complete with Hashem 
    your G-d. The Ramban counts this as one of the 613 
    <i>mitzvos</i>, with two parts: acknowledging <i>Hakadosh</i><i> Baruch Hu</i> 
    as omniscient and omnipotent, and seeking one's needs only from<i> Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i>, not through 
    any other channel. </p>
  <p>The Rambam does not count "<i>tamim</i><i> tihye" as</i> one of the 613
  <i>mitzvos</i>. This omission can be explained in several 
    ways. According to the Terumas Hadeshen 
    (psakim 96), the Rambam's 
    omission is consistent with what he wrote in Hilchos 
    Avodah Zarah (11:16). The Rambam 
    there explains that one cannot seek out his needs through any channel other 
    than <i>Hakadosh</i><i> Baruch Hu</i>. 
    This is not because other media have inherent powers. The Torah forbade them 
    because they are all false and have no power or validity at all. The commandment 
    "<i>tamim</i><i> tihye</i>", then, 
    is axiomatic - one should completely follow G-d because only He has the power 
    to help. The Ramban himself suggests that the Rambam does not count general, comprehensive principles as 
    <i>mitzvos</i>. "<i>Kedoshim</i><i> 
    tihyu</i>," for example, is not counted as a specific 
    <i>mitzva</i>, but is rather a general approach 
    to religious life. The same reasoning, the Ramban 
    suggests, could apply to "<i>tamim</i><i> tihye</i>."</p>
  <p>Alternatively, the Rashba in his <i>teshuvos</i> (1:413) explains that "<i>tamim</i><i> 
    tihye</i>" is not a commandment, but a promise or 
    condition. Rashi, commenting on the <i>possuk</i> "<i>tamim</i><i> tihye</i>," explains "<i>kol</i> 
    <i>mah</i><i> sheyavo alecha, kabel bitmimus</i>." 
    If a person accepts with "<i>temimus</i>" everything 
    he experiences, i.e. lives up to "<i>tamim</i><i> 
    tihe", </i>then "<i>az</i><i> tihye imo ulechelko</i>", 
    i.e. then one will be "<i>im</i><i> Hashem Elokecha</i>".</p>
  <p>The Gemara in Shabbos 
    (30b), based on the final verse in Koheles "<i>ki</i><i> ze kol ha'adam</i>," explains that 
    the whole world was created for man. The Akeidas 
    Yitzchok, however, raises an obvious difficulty. When G-d 
    created all other creatures, He said "<i>ki</i><i> 
    tov</i>," it was good. However, when G-d created man, He did 
    not say "<i>ki</i><i> tov</i>." 
    If man was the reason for creation, why wasn't "<i>ki</i><i> 
    tov</i>" pronounced when man was created? One could 
    suggest that the very existence of other creatures, who 
    are not endowed with free will and evil inclination, is a fulfillment of the 
    will of <i>Hakadosh</i><i> Baruch Hu</i>. 
    Human beings, however, must exercise their <i>bechira</i><i> 
    chofshis</i> to realize their full potential. Their 
    creation alone is not the achievement of this goal, rather a person must always 
    strive to improve himself, and attain excellence in his service of, and closeness 
    to, <i>Hakadosh</i><i> Baruch Hu.</i> </p>
  <p>The Sefer HaChinuch (Mitzvah 
    2) writes that this idea is evident in the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>bris</i><i> milah</i>. 
    <i>Hakadosh</i><i> Baruch Hu</i> 
    created man imperfectly, and commanded him to perfect himself. The Chinuch continues, "<i>Ki</i><i> 
    ka'asher tashlim tzuras haguf al yado</i>," just as a person must perfect himself physically, 
    "<i>ken</i><i> beyado lehashlim 
    tzuras nafsho</i>," so too one must constantly strive to attain <i>temimus</i>, i.e. spiritual perfection. </p>

		<title><![CDATA[<I>Mishkan</I>: Sanctioned and Unifying]]></title>

		<date><![CDATA[2003]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: shmini]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The beginning of <I>Parshas Shmini</I> describes the sacrifices brought during the days of the consecration of the <I>mishkan</I>. Both a calf and a goat were brought as atonement offerings. The fact that both were brought seems unusual. The Ramban quotes the Toras Kohanim, which says that the calf was brought as an atonement for the Golden Calf, and the goat was brought as an atonement for the selling of Yosef. What is the link between these two sins and the building of the <I>mishkan</I>?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Medrash Tanchuma explains that the sin of the Golden Calf was not simple idol worship, but rather was a misguided attempt by <I>Am Yisroel</I> to develop a channel for their service of Hashem. The Meshech Chochma says that Moshe broke the tablets because <I>Am Yisroel</I> would have illegitimately used them in the same manner as they did the Golden Calf, and Moshe wanted to show that nothing can be done without the command of Hashem. Furthermore, the Beis Halevi explains that even that which is a <U>legitimate</U> need requires a <I>mattir</I> (Divine approval).<I> </I>While <I>Am Yisroel</I> cRaved the presence of <I>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</I>, rather than creating the Golden Calf they should have waited to see what form of service Hashem would command. That is why the Torah always stresses that Betzalel, who was charged with the construction of the <I>mishkan</I>, was a descendant of Chur, who had nothing to do with the sin of the Golden Calf. Betzalel 's heritage was based on acting solely on the word of Hashem, and the <I>mishkan</I> itself was "<I>ka'asher tzvia Hashem</I>" ("as G-d commanded"). Therefore, the consecration of the <I>mishkan</I> was an appropriate time to atone for the Golden Calf, as the "<I>ka'asher tzvia Hashem</I>" of the <I>mishkan</I> corrects the flawed attitude which resulted in the unsanctioned Golden Calf.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Ramban writes in the beginning of Parshas Teruma that the Mishkan's purpose is to capture and foster the unity which was present when the Jews received the Torah on <I>Har Sinai</I>. <I>Yerushalayim</I> itself, the home of the <I>Beis Hamikdosh</I>, is described in Tehillim as "<I>Yerushalayim hab'nuya, ke'ir shechubra la yachdav</I>." The medrash interprets this verse to mean "<I>shesham na'asim kol Yisrael chaveirim</I>", i.e. a sense of unity pervades in <I>Yerushalayim</I>. And similarly, Rashi (on the verse "<I>Lo ta'asun ken la Hashem Elokeichem</I>") points out that whereas other religions have multiple holy sites, all Jews have only <I>Yerushalayim</I>. Therefore, building the <I>mishkan</I>, an entity which creates unity in <I>Am Yisrael</I>, is an atonement for the selling of Yosef, which was the result of discord and hate among the brothers. The Gemara (Shabbos 10b) tells us that the sin of selling Yosef brought about the exile in Egypt. Baseless hatred brings about the exile and the destruction of the unifying <I>Beis haMikdash</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In this light, one can understand the sin of Nadav and Avihu. At first glance, what they did does not seem to be such a grievous sin. If one understands, however, that the Golden Calf represents a misguided attempt to serve G-d, then the unsanctioned sacrifice of Nadav and Avihu undermined the purpose of the Mishkan, which atoned for the Golden Calf.  No one can determine new form of <I>avodas Hashem</I>. This is why the verse describes the actions of Nadav and Avihu as "<I>Asher lo tziva osam</I>," G-d had not commanded them. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Gemara (Eruvin 63) relates another element of the sacrifice of Nadav and Avihu. They were guilty of teaching a Halacha in front of their <I>rebbeim</I> - they saw this as an opportunity to rise to power and undermine the leadership of Moshe and Aharon. This contentious sacrifice undermined the unifying aspect of the <I>mishkan</I>, which atoned for the sin of selling Yosef. Their sin was both <I>bein adam lamakom</I> <U>and</U> <I>bein adam lachaveiro</I>, and that is why the response was so severe and immediate.</P>

  <p><i>Parshas Chayei Sara </i>records the first search for a marriage partner 
    in Jewish history. The <i>Ran</i> (<i>D'rasha</i> 5) explains that Avraham 
    sent Eliezer to his birthplace to search for a wife for Yitzchok from amongst 
    his family (Braishis 24:3,4). Though Avraham's extended family worshipped 
    idols, their character traits were still superior to those of the Cannanites. 
    While a proper theological approach can be relatively easily acquired in adulthood, 
    it is almost impossible to radically change one's character. Therefore, the 
    test of a potential mate, both then and now, must emphasize <i>middos</i>.</p>
  <p>Eliezer devised a method to test for the <i>midda</i> of <i>chessed</i>. 
    The girl of whom he would ask for a drink, who would then respond - drink, 
    and I will water your camels - would be a worthy wife for Yitzchok (24:14).</p>
  <p>The Kli Yakar (24:12) states that the test was not only for <i>chessed</i>, 
    but also for <i>tsnius</i>. He interprets "<i>Hakrei na l'fanai hayom</i>" 
    ("Let it happen before me today") to mean that Eliezer prayed for an unusual 
    occurrence, a <i>mikre</i>, in which a woman who did not ordinarily venture 
    out would appear at the well. The Kli Yakar explains "<i>V'ish lo y'da'a</i>" 
    ("and no man knew her") (24:16) literally - nobody knew who she was because 
    she had never been seen at the well before. For this reason, Eliezer had to 
    ask her directly who she was, as the more polite approach of asking others 
    proved unsuccessful.</p>
  <p>In fact, <i>chessed</i> and <i>tsnius</i> are related, as evidenced by a 
    common expression, <i>ayin yafa</i>, quoted twice by the Kli Yakar (24:14,22). 
    The phrase "<i>Kala she'eineha yafos eina tsricha b'dika</i>" ("a bride whose 
    eyes are beautiful need not be investigated") (Ta'anis 24a) is explained as 
    referring not to physical beauty, but to a woman who exhibits the <i>midda</i> 
    of <i>chessed</i>. <i>Ayin yafa</i> describes the characteristic of giving 
    more generously than the norm, while <i>ayin ra'a</i> means giving less than 
    the norm (Terumos 4:3). A bride who is kind to others need not be examined 
    since she possesses the trait which assures that she will treat her husband 
    properly.</p>
  <p>Rashi (24:22) comments that Eliezer's gifts to Rivka hinted at the <i>shekalim</i>, 
    the coins offered by <i>Klal Yisroel</i> for a census, and the <i>luchos</i>, 
    the tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written. The Kli Yakar points 
    out that the <i>shekalim</i> were used to count the people in order to avoid 
    an <i>ayin hara</i>, and that the first <i>luchos</i> were broken because 
    of the <i>ayin hara</i> caused by the publicity at <i>Har Sinai</i>. One who 
    possesses an <i>ayin yafa</i>, concludes the Kli Yakar, is protected from 
    <i>ayin hara</i>. Thus, <i>ayin yafa</i>, generosity, which is the opposite 
    of <i>ayin ra'a</i>, stinginess, protects from <i>ayin hara</i>, and evil 
    eye.</p>
  <p><i>Ayin hara</i> refers to publicly flaunted wealth (see Bava Basra 2b), 
    explicit national census, and even a public Divine revelation. The evil eye 
    caused the loss of wealth, a national plague, and the breaking of the <i>luchos, 
    </i>respectively. The second <i>luchos</i>, which were given privately, lasted, 
    proving that nothing is better than <i>tsnius</i> (Rashi, Shemos 34:3).</p>
  <p>Hence, <i>tsnius</i>, the opposite of <i>ayin hara</i>, is related to <i>chessed</i>, 
    the opposite of <i>ayin ra'a</i>. The connection between <i>ayin ra'a</i> 
    and <i>ayin hara</i> is a psychological one. When one wishes to project his 
    superiority, be it material, numerical, and even spiritual in nature, it usually 
    involves putting others down and treating them poorly. The <i>ayin hara</i> 
    of others observing one's public success is thereby related to the <i>ayin 
    ra'a</i> of a publicly successful person towards others.</p>
  <p>Of course, the opposite of these traits are <i>tsnius</i> and <i>chessed</i>, 
    respectively, factors in the test of Rivka that continue to be critical in 
    choosing a wife today. And while the specifics of <i>tsnius</i> are undoubtedly 
    affected, within certain bounds, by time and place (see Rambam Hil. Ishus 
    13:11 and Minchas Shlomo 91, 23), the concept, as well as its particular application 
    to women (see Rashi Braishis 1:28 and 18:9), is as timeless and universal 
    as the Torah itself.</p>
  <p>Arguably, the recent dramatic change in the role of women in <st1:country-region>America</st1:country-region> 
    has made it more difficult, and more important, for a woman to pass Eliezer's 
    test. When the woman's place was at home, her sense of <i>tsnius</i> was more 
    readily achieved, and her schedule allowed for a greater focus on <i>chessed</i>. 
    The working woman phenomenon makes <i>tsnius</i> more difficult to achieve, 
    and yet more critical than ever to avoid the <i>pritzus</i> of the workplace. 
    <i>Chessed</i> activity, a challenge to an already crowded schedule, is crucial 
    to overcome the influence of the narcissistic society in which we find ourselves.</p>
  <p>What <i>middos </i>should a woman look for in a husband? Precisely the same 
    ones, i.e., <i>chessed</i> and <i>tsnius</i>. A man should view marriage 
    as a giving relationship, a lifetime opportunity to shower loving-kindness 
    on his wife (see Michtav Me'Eliyahu I:38,39). Only a <i>ba'al chessed</i> 
    before marriage can be expected to be a proper Torah husband. He must also 
    understand that Hashem demands of everyone both, <i>tsnius</i>, a universal 
    prerequisite for wisdom (Mishle 11:2), along with <i>chessed</i> and its prerequisite, 
    <i>mishpat</i> (Micha 6:8). Only then will he function in life, and in marriage, 
    appropriately.</p>
  <p>The twin evils of western society, self-centeredness and self-promotion, 
    make <i>chessed </i>and <i>tsnius</i> difficult, yet critical, goals for a 
    Torah personality. This is certainly true for men, who are even more involved 
    than today's women in the modern workplace. In choosing a spouse, women, as 
    well as men, should focus on <i>chessed</i> and <i>tsnius</i>.</p>
  <p>Eliezer begins his fateful mission by praying to Hashem to do <i>chessed</i> 
    and enable him to find the proper wife for Yitzchok (24:12). Every search 
    for a marriage partner must be preceded by <i>tefilla</i>. The single most 
    important decision in a person's life, deciding whom to marry, certainly needs 
    divine assistance.</p>
  <p>Indeed, the realization that one is dependent on <i>siyata dishmaya </i>is 
    a humbling experience and makes a person more <i>tzanua</i>, and therefore 
    a better marriage candidate. The request for Hashem's <i>chessed</i> is more 
    appropriate and effective when one focuses on <i>chessed</i> in the choice 
    of a spouse.</p>
  <p>Hashem responded to Eliezer's <i>tefilla</i>, and the rest is history. May 
    the <i>tefillos</i> of <i>Am Yisroel</i> for, and especially by, those seeking 
    a marriage partner be answered as well.</p>

<P>
The hidden (sins) are for Hashem, but the revealed (sins) are for us and our children forever, to carry out all the words of this Torah (Devarim, 29:28).  This climax of two lengthy descriptions of the curse which will befall <I>Am Yisroel</I> if it strays from Torah observance delineates the proper response of the observant community to individual sinners.
</P><P>
Hashem does not punish <I>Am Yisroel</I> for the hidden thoughts or sins of individuals. However, we are required to destroy the evil of revealed sins from our midst. Otherwise, the entire community will be punished. This applies only after we became responsible for one another at <I>Har Grizim</I> and <I>Har  Eval</I> (Rashi).
</P><P>
The sense of community, which began in earnest when we crossed the <I>Yarden</I> into <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>, demands a response to deviation from communal Torah norms. <I>Beis din</I> must punish violations of Torah law in the biblically prescribed manner of death or flogging.
</P><P>
At <I>Har Eval</I>, the entire people gathered and cursed twelve types of sinners, whose sins are typically committed in private. As a result, Hashem will punish the sinners, thereby sparing the community at large (Rashbam 27:15).
</P><P>
Failure to punish public sinners, or to curse private sinners, is construed as acceptance of these sins as a legitimate alternative to strict adherance to Torah.
</P><P>
This can cause widespread non-observance. Hashem punishes the people so that they restore communal religious discipline.
</P><P>
Nowadays, <I>beis din</I> no longer imposes corporal punishment. Even Talmudic extra-legal measures to eliminate grievous offenders ("<I>moridim</I>") no longer apply. In Talmudic times, people realized that such offenders threatened the well-being of the community, and that their elimination was beneficial.  Nowadays, such actions would be viewed as strong-armed thuggary and would be counterproductive (Chazon Ish Y.D. 2:16).
</P><P>
Similarly, cursing wrongdoers would backfire in today's world, when even the more recently practiced cherem has fallen into disuse. In an open society, these curses would not deter potential sinners and would only yield more hatred within our people. Moreover, the majority of those who violate <I>Halacha</I> do so out of ignorance, and are not included in the biblical curses (Ramban  29:28).
</P><P>
How, then, can we maintain our own limited community in a postmodern world  which denies absolute truth, at a time when punishing and cursing wrongdoers are  not viable options?
</P><P>
First, we must make Torah life exciting and attractive. We can no longer take observance for granted in an open global marketplace of competing ideals and values.
</P><P>
Second, we must adapt the biblical precedent of proclaiming sinful activity as unacceptable. While we can no longer punish or curse offenders, we can, and must, excoriate sinful activity. We must distinguish between the person and the action.
</P><P>
The primary purpose of proclaiming sinful behavior and heretical doctrine as such is the preservation and strengthening of the existing Torah community. The formulation of timeless principles in a trendy world has the additional benefit of proclaiming the essence of Torah Judaism before the entire world. After all, all of the nations (29:23, 24) talk about us and our covenant with Hashem.
</P><P>
Finally, a clear and unapologetic articulation of the Torah's boundaries and its intolerance of deviationist practices projects the image of a serious religious commitment to Jews who are searching for true meaning. "The hidden for  Hashem" refers to assimilated Jews as well (Rashi Tehilim 87:6), and we do His  work by teaching uncompromising eternal law, even as we show appropriate  compassion and understanding for the "<I>tinokos shenishbu</I>" whose  <I>kiruv</I> we cRave (Rambam Hil. Mamrim 2:2).
</P><P>
<I>Hanistaros</I> - evil thoughts (Rashi) and deeds (Rashbam) hidden from the public, sins that are unknown to those who commit them (Rambam), and assimilated Jews - <I>lashem Elokeinu</I>. Let us learn and fulfill <B>our</B> responsibilities for <I>nistaros</I> and <I>niglos</I> - to carry out all the words of the Torah.
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moshe spoke to Hashem saying, "May Hashem appoint a man over the assembly who shall go out before them" (27:15-17). Rashi explains that as soon as Moshe was told that he would die and not enter <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> (27:13) he put aside his own concerns and dealt with those of the public. Yet, according to a later Rashi (27:16), Moshe said, "The time has come for me to request my concerns, that my son should inherit my greatness," which would seem to contradict Rashi's earlier statement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hashem said to Moshe, "Take Yehoshua and place your hand on him" (27:18). Didn't Moshe realize that Yehoshua was worthier than his own sons were? The answer to this question is based on yet another statement of Rashi (Devarim 31:7). Moshe called Yehoshua and said to him, "Be strong because you shall come with the people to the land" etc. Moshe said, "The elders of the generation shall be with you. Everything should be done according to their opinion and advice." But Hashem said (31:23) "Because you shall bring <I>B'nai Yisroel</I> to the land etc...Even against their will. Everything depends on you. Take a rod and hit their head. There is one leader for a generation, not two."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two formulations, apparently contradictory, are, in fact, complementary. Moshe served as the head of the <I>Sanhedrin</I> (Sanhedrin 2a), as well as the king of Israel (Ibn Ezra 33:5). Yehoshua assumed both of these positions. As the head of the <I>Sanhedrin</I>, Moshe considered the opinion of the elders, and told Yehoshua to do the same. Hashem's formulation referred to Yehoshua's role as the king, which would require forceful and exclusive leadership. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moshe requested that his son succeed him as the king. Indeed, if a son is suitable for leadership, he succeeds his father (Rashi 17:20), even if others are more worthy. The reason for filial succession is the avoidance of <I>machlokes</I>, which is nearly inevitable if everyone is a candidate. When Moshe requested "his concerns", it was really "the concerns of the public", to prevent a battle over the succession.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hashem responded that he wanted to have one leader to serve as the king and the head of the <I>Sanhedrin</I>. Yehoshua was the only one who could assume both positions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hashem told Moshe to place one hand on Yeshoshua, but he placed both hands on Yehoshua, and filled him with wisdom (Rashi, Bamidbar 27:23). Apparently, Moshe realized all along that Yehoshua would lead the <I>Sanhedrin</I>. His dialogue with Hashem related only to the kingship. Hashem told Moshe to appoint Yehoshua as the king, who would lead the people in battle (Rashi 17). This appointment required that Moshe place one hand on Yehoshua. However, Moshe appointed Yehoshua in both capacities, placing both hands on him and filling him with the wisdom of Torah as well as the strength for battle. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moshe requested a bifurcated leadership because he knew that this was the usual way. Indeed, of the forty Torah leaders (listed by the Rambam in his introduction to Mishne Torah) from Moshe until Rav Ashi edited the Talmud, only very few were kings as well (Moshe, Yehoshua, and Dovid).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hashem responded "This is not what has entered into My mind (<I>alsa b'machshava</I>)" The expression "<I>alsa b'machshava</I>" refers to an ideal state which can not be sustained practically (see Rashi Breishis 1:1). Moshe was ready to abandon the ideal of one leader, a system that lessens the constant conflict between religious and temporal authority, as impractical. But Hashem insisted that it be maintained for one more generation in the person of Yehoshua. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our time and place, there is no national authority, religious or temporal, in the Jewish community. Religious authority is rejected or marginalized even by parts of religious society. Scholarship and leadership are viewed by some as mutually exclusive. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even when practicality leads to a separation of power, or influence, it is important to recognize that this is not an ideal. Moshe, Yehoshua, and Dovid were ideal national religious leaders who led politically and militarily as well. This is impossible for many reasons nowadays.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet great Torah scholars led local and larger communities, narrowly defined, throughout Jewish history. The Rav's celebrated eulogy for Rav Chaim Ozer, the <I>gadoal hador</I> who was consulted on worldly matters as well, describes but one example. All enduring, successful movements in religious Torah society have been led by Torah scholars. Of course, such leaders must realize that many decisions are beyond their purview, and must have love and respect for the laity and its proper leaders. The lessons learned from Moshe and Yehoshua must inform Torah society's understanding of leadership for all generations</P>

<P>Our Torah is exciting in every facet. Not only is every word especially challenging, but special effects of the Torah are remarkable. In <I>Parshas Behaaloscha</I> we find two familiar verses, recited throughout the Jewish world whenever the Torah is removed from the <I>aron hakodesh</I> and is returned, namely "<I>vaihi binsoa ha-aron</I>" and "<I>uvnucha yomar</I>". The Talmud Shabbos (116a) notes that these two verses are not in their proper place. For this reason the Torah surrounds these verses with two inverted <I>nuns</I> akin to our use of brackets. In fact, the commentaries on Rashi note that it is not at random that the letter <I>nun </I>was chosen, as its numerical value is fifty, and indeed these verses belong in <I>Parshas Bamidbar</I>, chapter two, following verse seventeen, which is fifty paragraphs earlier in the Torah. Why then were they placed here? "To separate one transgression from another".</P>
<P>A cursory view of the text leaves us bewildered and perplexed. The verses immediately following <I>vaihi binsoa</I> speak of the complaining of <I>Bnai Yisroel</I>. Instead of appreciating the high speed of tRavel, i.e. that Hashem enabled them to accomplish a three-day journey in one day, they complained of the fatigue it had caused them. What is most puzzling, however, is the fact that the Talmud identifies the first transgression as being, "they journeyed from the mountain of Hashem" (10:33). What is their wrongdoing that requires the special effect of the letter <I>nun </I>to follow? The Ramban in his commentary notes that they journeyed from <I>Har Sinai</I> "<I>b'simcha</I>", in happiness, as a child runs from school, glad that Hashem did not give them the additional <I>mitzvos</I>.</P>
<P>Truth be told, one could argue on their behalf, that they did not leave <I>Har Sinai</I> until the cloud reflecting Hashem's presence ascended from atop the <I>mishkan</I>, in accordance with His directive. Moreover, they were going to do a <I>mitzva</I>, namely to conquer and settle the Land of Israel. Where is their sin?</P>
<P>To appreciate their wrongdoing, we must contrast, notes the Alter of Slobodka, the way the Torah describes the manner in which Bnai Yisroel left the <I>Yam-suf</I> and <I>Har Sinai</I>. Regarding the former the Torah says (<I>Shemos</I> 15:22) "<I>vayasa</I>" which means Moshe caused Israel to journey, as Rashi explains citing the Mechilta. Moshe had to move the people against their will. The Egyptians were so confident that they would retrieve their former slaves that they bedecked and adorned their horse and chariots with gold, silver, and precious jewels. When the Egyptians were drowned the people were busy gathering the booty. When Moshe announced that it was time to tRavel to the desert to get the Torah they resisted his urging, as children not wishing to leave a swimming pool on a hot day. The jewels of Egypt were hard to resist. Moshe had to "<I>vayasa</I>" - prod them, cause them to journey. Here in contrast, taking leave of Mount Sinai it does not say <I>vayasa</I> to indicate that they resisted or even gave a groan or <I>krechst</I> over having to leave "Yeshivas Sinai", rather "<I>vayisu</I>" - and they tRaveled. The <I>mitzvos</I> of Sinai were not as hard to leave. At <I>Yam-suf</I> their behavior demonstrated we want more (booty), while at Sinai they were saying we have enough (<I>mitzvos</I>). The Ramban concludes his comments on this matter by saying that perhaps were it not for this negative attitude, Hashem would have brought them to the Land of Israel immediately.</P>
<P>It is significant to note how the earlier themes of the <I>parsha</I> reflect a different perspective. Rashi (<I>Bamidbar</I> 8:2) quotes the Tanchuma that explains the directive to Aharon to light the menorah immediately following the offerings of the princes, as Aharon felt slighted and deprived that he and his tribe did not have a formal role in the dedication ceremonies of the <I>mishkan</I>, as did the other princes and tribes. True, Aharon had all of the <I>mitzvos</I> of <I>kehuna</I> (priestly services), but he wanted more.</P>
<P>Similarly, the institution of <I>Pesach Sheini</I>, the second <I>Pesach</I> offering, was given to the nation not in the usual format of "Hashem said to Moshe". Rather, the Torah lauds the behavior of those individuals who were involved in a <I>mitzva</I> (of either transporting the remains of Joseph or having to attend to some other dead body) and were therefore unable and indeed exempt from participating in the <I>korban Pesach</I> (Passover offering). Rather than quietly accept their exemption, they petition Moshe and say, "we want more". Indeed they were granted the privilege they so desired, to offer the <I>korban Pesach</I> one month later.</P>
<P>The Torah is teaching us the significance of our attitude towards <I>mitzvos</I>. Aharon Hakohain and the initiators of <I>Pesach Sheini</I> are recorded in perpetuity as heroes, and the Sinai tRavelers are permanently stigmatized, as demonstrated by the inverted <I>nuns</I>.</P>
<P>This is a most appropriate lesson anytime, but especially at this season of graduations. Have we really succeeded in our educational system by noting a sigh or <I>krechst</I> from our graduates, as they take leave of our yeshivas, or are they running from something?</P>
<P>Two persons can do the same activity, but their differing attitudes create for each their own unique <I>mitzva</I>. Picture two Jews present at the same prayer service. Upon completion, one is out the door in a most hurried fashion, while the other respectfully sits down for a moment, pausing, reciting (Psalms 140:14) "only the righteous will thank your name, the upright will sit in your presence." Then, leave by walking backwards for a few steps, respectfully, as if taking leave of a king.</P>
<I><P>Parshas Behaaloscha</I> presents a tough personal question to each of us: are <I>mitzvos</I> a privilege or a burden? And the answer to the above is most consequential.</P>

<P>It is commonplace in the Torah for the same idea to be presented twice. Each time, it behooves us to analyze and understand the need for the particular repetition. Hashem promised Avraham at the <I>Bris ben Habisarim</I> (<I>Breishis </I>15:13, 14), "Know with certainty that your descendents will be strangers in a foreign land. They will enslave and oppress them for 400 years. The nation they shall serve I will judge. Afterwards, they, the oppressed, will leave with great wealth."</P>
<P>Thus it is understandable that preceding the last and final plague, Hashem instructs Moshe (<I>Shmos </I>11:2-3), "Please speak to the people, that each man request of his fellow, and each woman of her fellow, silver vessels and gold vessels. Hashem granted the people favor in the eyes of Egypt." What, at first glance, is  strange in the use of the word 'please'? When all the later preparations are communicated to the people, including the details of the first <I>Pesach </I>offering, at no point is the word "please" used. Moreover, why does the Torah repeat (Chapter 1235-36), "The children of Israel carried out the word of Moses, they requested from the Egyptians silver vessels, gold vessels, and garments. Hashem gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians and they granted their request, and they emptied Egypt. Why is the first mention not sufficient to inform us that they left Egypt with great wealth. In addition, Rashi, in his commentary on the second verse (12:35) adds to our understanding of the text by stating that <I>Bnei Yisroel</I> carried out the word of Moshe , and refers us back to the earlier verse, of having complied with Moshe's directive of 'each man requesting of his fellow.'</P>
<P>The Vilna Gaon <I>zt"l</I> (as found in Kol Eliyahu) presents a magnificent understanding of the above cited verses. Initially he asks, as noted above, why the use of 'please'? Secondly, our understanding of the first directive as referring to the Jewish nation requesting of the Egyptians silver and gold cannot be correct. He notes that the Torah uses the words "<I>me'ace re'ehu</I>" ("from his fellows") and proves from the Talmud (Bava Kamma 36b) that "<I>re'ehu</I>" is used to describe one Jew to another, and not a Jew to a non-Jew. Thus is Shemos (21:35), "if one man's ox should strike his fellow's ox", the ensuing laws apply only if both litigants are Jewish, and not if a Jew's ox strikes the ox of an Egyptian. Thus the Vilan Gaon concludes that the first request was for Jews to ask and respond generously one to another. It is for this reason that "please" is used, as this was something that was not necessarily understood as part of the departure preparations. The Gaon is teaching that in order to find favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, they had to do <I>chessed</I> (kindness) to one another. Thus the above cited teaching of Rashi is most understandable. Prior to the last and final plague, the Jewish people established <I>g'machs</I>, initiated acts of kindness one to another (12: 2-3). After the killing of the first born, the former slaves being hastened out of Egypt, having demonstrated generosity one to another, the Egyptian people responded in kind, and they too forced valuables upon the Jews (12:35-36) (see Ohr Hachaim).</P>
<P>We generally look upon the Jewish people as passive in their liberation, except for the Pesach ritual. The later together with a circumcision was a spiritual connection with Hashem. The insight of the Gaon is that a social pre-requisite was also necessary, the extending of <I>chessed</I> one to another.</P>
<P>The notion is further developed by the Chofetz Chaim zt"l in his commentary on the Torah, on commenting Shemos (15:13), "with your kindness you guided this people that you redeemed". At first glance the words "your kindness" is referring to the kindness of Hashem. The Chofetz Chaim cites from the Tane D'bei Eliyahu (ch. 23) that already in Egypt the fledgling Jewish nation banded together and entered into a covenant with each other to do <I>chessed</I>. They saw as the servitude and persecution was intensifying that their only recourse was to emulate Hashem and exercise <I>chessed</I>. This concern for the needs of the next one, especially at a time when one would naturally focus on <U>their pain<I>, </I></U>their needs, their suffering, facilitated their redemption and deliverance from Egypt.</P>
<P>The Chofetz Chaim buttresses this idea with the verse from Isiah (54:10) "for the mountains may be moved and the hills may falter, but <U>my</U> kindness shall not be removed from you and <U>my</U> covenant of peace shall not falter". The "mountains" refer to the <I>zechus avos</I> (merit of our forefathers). The "hills" is a reference to the <I>zechus emahos</I> (the righteousness of our matriarchs).  Though the above may no longer sustain our people, but <U>your</U> kindness, the prophet promises, will permanently endure.</P>
<P>It is thus understandable that when the students of Rav Elazar (Sanhedrin 98b) asked him, what may they do to be spared the pains of the coming of <I>moshiach</I>? He responded "involve yourselves in Torah and <I>g'milus chassadim</I>". <I>Chessed</I> brings redemption.</P>
<P>It is fascinating to note an additional understanding of <I>"olom chessed yiboneh</I>" (Tehillim 89:3) "the world is sustained by kindness". When a Jew partakes of fruits or vegetables, fish or meat, or any drink other wine he recites the <I>b'racha achrona</I> (after blessing) of <I>Borei Nefashos</I>. The unique composition of this blessing is that the Jew thanks Hashem for "having created numerous living things with their <U>deficiencies</U>". We acknowledge that Hashem did not man self-sufficient, thus building into the very core and fabric of society the need for one to help another.</P>
<P>In this most difficult time for <I>Am Yisrael</I>, what can you do? Call a shut-in visit a senior citizen residence and spend half am hour with a lonely soul. Relieve a parent of an autistic child for an hour on Shabbos, giving them some rest as well. Invite the not-yet observant Jewish families down the block to your Shabbos table.  The Vilna Gaon and Chfetz Chaim assure us that your unique acts of kindness today assure tomorrow's redemption.</P>

		<content><![CDATA[



  <p>Both the Sefer Haikarim 
    (by Rav Yosef Albo) and the Akeidas Yitzchak (by 
    Rav Yitzchak Arma) point 
    out that the Torah does not say "<i>ki-tov</i>", 
    "it was good", in reference to the creation of man. The term "<i>ki-tov</i>" 
    is used when something existing has been completed and perfected. 
Rashi in his commentary on the second day of creation teaches 
    that, "<i>ki-tov</i>" was omitted on that day, because 
    the work of the water was not completed until the third day and a thing that 
    is not completed is not at its perfection and at its best.</p>
  <p>Adam is so called because he comes from the "
<i>adama</i>" - the earth. In addition, teaches the 
Shalah, his very name is a charge: <i>adameh</i><i> 
    L'Elyon</i> - I will be as my Creator on high. As 
    He is a creator so is man to be; man is to create himself. The Torah does 
    not say "<i>ki-tov</i>" in reference to man for 
    his mission and purpose in this world is to create a man of whom someday it 
    will hopefully be said he was <i>tov</i>.</p>
  <p><i>Ki-tov</i> is written on the sixth day in reference 
    to the animals. The Talmud (Bava Kama 
    65b) states, " an ox is called an ox even on the day 
    that it is born, and a ram is called a ram on the day that it is born." The 
    greatness of man is that when Hashem says "<i>na-aseh</i><i> 
    adam</i>" (1:24) - "let us make man", it means that 
    with the natural resources and potential that Hashem 
    has afforded and extended to each man, may he, together with Hashem, 
    complete himself.</p>
  <p>Just like a child leaves the home of a parent escorted by a potential shaped 
    by their character traits, God in His infinite wisdom clothes us with individual 
    presence simply by virtue of our birth day. The Talmud (
Shabbos 156a) teaches that it was written in 
Rav Yehoshua Ben Levi's ledger that 
    one born on Sunday will be a leader, as Sunday leads off the rest of the week. 
    Rashi notes that both righteous and wicked people 
    are born that day. The Talmud is teaching that one born on a Sunday may posses 
    a natural proclivity towards leadership, yet the choice of channeling that 
    leadership for good or bad is up to the individual.</p>
  <p>He who is born on a Monday will be an angry man. In the second day of creation 
    the waters were divided. Similarly, Rashi notes, 
    there will often be division between him and others. Anger does not have 
    to connote something inherently negative, rather someone troubled with the 
    status-quo. Many people might see wrong and evil about but not be moved to 
    indignation and protest.</p>
  <p>One who is born on a Tuesday will be wealthy. On the third day of creation 
    herbage and vegetation were created. Rashi notes 
    that as herbage sprouts and grows very quickly so will this individuals endeavors.</p>
  <p>He who is born on Wednesday will be a wise and radiant man. On the fourth 
    day of creation the luminaries were set in place. There are so many areas 
    of knowledge that God gives man the potential to address; he has the choice 
    to channel his life to Torah or to other endeavors.</p>
  <p>One born on a Thursday will have a predisposition towards performing deeds 
    of kindness. The reason for this is that the fish and fowl were created on 
    that day. Rashi explains that fish and fowl do not 
    expend much effort in acquiring their  food, rather 
    they are supported by Hashem, who in His kindness 
    makes their food easily available to them.</p>
  <p>He who is born on a Friday will be an assiduous man. As the nature of Friday 
    is to carefully prepare for Shabbos, this person 
    will have a greater propensity for detail.</p>
  <p>One who is born on a Shabbos will, if he merits 
    it, die on a Shabbos. Moreover, he shall be called 
    a great and holy man.</p>
  <p>The Sefer HaChinuch writes 
    in conjunction with the mitzvah of <i>bris</i><i> 
    milah</i> that Hashem 
    did not create man perfect from the womb, and circumcision is to impress upon 
    man that just as his physical completion is in the hands of man, so too is 
    he entrusted and charged to perfect his character and elevate his divine gifts 
    towards the service of Hashem and man.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: reeh]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>Among the fifty-five <EM>mitzvos</EM> found in <EM>Parshas Re'eh</EM>, six are 
devoted to the <EM>maisis</EM> - the individual who entices another Jew to 
worship idolatry. The Torah was most severe in its treatment of the 
<EM>maisis</EM>. The <EM>maisis</EM> is subject to capital punishment by stoning 
and many exceptions to the judgment process were practiced. Usually, the 
testimony of witnesses who were planted without the knowledge of the criminal 
and were unseen by him is unacceptable. Normally, it is mandatory that the two 
witnesses warn the criminal of his crime and the exact punishment he will 
receive. The Rambam in <EM>Hilchos</EM> <EM>Sanhedrin</EM> (11:5), based upon 
the <EM>gemara</EM> <EM>Sanhedrin</EM> (66b) writes that in the case of the 
<EM>maisis</EM>, the witnesses may be hidden and testify without having given any warning.
</P><P>
In all other circumstances, if one is tried in a capital 
case and found to be innocent, and someone afterwards claims that they have new 
evidence to convict, the trial is not reopened. This is based upon "do not 
execute the righteous" (<EM>Shemos</EM> 23:7). However, in the case of the 
<EM>maisis</EM>, he is returned to trial. Conversely, if one is found guilty in 
all other areas of Jewish law, and on the way to the execution someone comes 
forth claiming new exonerating evidence, we return the condemned to the 
courtroom, even many times, in an attempt to save his life, as it says (ibid) " 
do not execute the righteous". We do not, however, return the <EM>maisis</EM>. 
Finally, a Jew is required to love each and every Jew, even a criminal. The 
<EM>maisis</EM>, however, is an exception, as the Torah states (<EM>Devarim</EM> 13:9) "you shall not accede to him", understood by our Ravs to mean, you shall not show any love or compassion towards him.
</P>
<P>
The&nbsp;Alter of Kelm makes a startling observation. 
The severe treatment of the <EM>maisis</EM> is "<EM>ki be'kaish 
l'hadichacha</EM>" - since he tried to make you abandon Hashem. Even though he 
did not succeed, the very attempt is enough of a heinous crime to strip the 
perpetrator of all of his rights. Conversely, imagine the good that is in store 
for one who attempts to bring another Jew closer to Hashem and the tradition; 
even if he does not succeed, the process itself is most rewarding. As the Talmud 
(<EM>Yuma</EM> 76a) teaches, the measure of Hashem's beneficence is greater than his measure of retribution. 
</P>
<P>
The virtue of reaching out and inviting another Jew to become familiar with his or her tradition is praiseworthy all year long. However, during the month of Elul it is especially significant. The Tur (Or Hachaim) writes in the name of Rav Chanina and Rav Yehoshua, how unique the Jewish people are! Ordinarily an individual on trial for his life, does not bathe, nor personally groom himself, nor dress in his fine attire. The Jewish people bathe and celebrate their day of judgment with optimism.
</P>
<P>
Reb Yisroel Salanter zt"l explains this phenomenon. 
Based upon the response of the Shunnamite woman, when asked, "Can something be 
said on your behalf to the king?" (<EM>Melachim</EM> II, 4:13) understood by the 
Zohar to mean, can something be said on your behalf to the King of Kings? She 
responded, "I dwell among my people", which is understood as her saying "Do not 
single me out. Moreover, I derive my comfort and redemption by being connected 
to and an integral part of my people". While the fate of each individual may be 
in jeopardy, the survival and success of <EM>Klal Yisroel</EM> has been assured. 
Thus, the most prudent thing an individual can do at this time of year is to 
connect themselves to their people, thereby riding the victorious coat-tails of 
<EM>Am Yisroel</EM>. Most certainly a sure way of connecting oneself to the 
<EM>Klal</EM> is to bring others under the wings of the <EM>Shechina</EM>
                                                                                                                                                         .
</P>
<P>
Often, outreach professionals, as well as individuals, 
will reflect upon sincere efforts that have not yet born fruits. These efforts 
can include many hours of trying, cajoling, studying, and spending Shabbos and 
<EM>yom tov</EM> together, but still to no avail. Understandably, frustration can set in. To combat that frustration, the inference from the maisis must be kept in mind -the effort to bring another Jew closer has great intrinsic value independent of the result.
</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vayikra]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>In <I>Parshas Vayikra</I> we are introduced to the laws of the <I>korbanos</I> - the offerings. The Ramban (Vayikra 1:9) teaches, "since man's deeds are accomplished through thought, speech, and action, therefore Hashem commanded that when mans sins and brings an offering, he should lay his hands upon it in contrast to the evil deed he committed, he should confess his sin verbally in contrast to his evil speech, and should burn the innards and the kidneys of the offering in fire because they are the instruments of thought and desire in the human being."</P>
<P>The extent to which <I>korbanos</I> are brought to rectify negative and improper thoughts may be seen from the following two instances. At the end of <I>Parshas Vayikra</I> the Torah introduces us to the <I>korban oleh v'yoraid</I> - the variable offering whose cost varies according to what the sinner can afford. It is called an "offering that goes up and down". The Torah lists three sins for which this offering is brought: denying testimony, contaminating holy things, and false or unfulfilled oaths. For violating any of the above, a wealthy individual brings a sheep or a goat for a <I>korban chatos</I>, a sin offering. If, however, one cannot afford the animal offering, he may bring in its stead two birds (either two turtledoves or two young doves) one for a <I>chatos</I> and the other as an <I>olah</I> (a burnt elevation offering).</P>
<P>The Evan Ezra (<I>Vayikra</I> 5:7) cites Rav Yitschok who addresses himself as to why two birds are brought by the poor man in lieu of the one animal brought by the wealthy sinner. He gives a most fascinating answer, namely: lest the poor man sinned with his improper thought! When the poor man confessed his sin of not testifying on someone's behalf, and wishes to accomplish a complete atonement but cannot afford to bring what he considers a good and proper atonement of either a sheep or goat, often when he brings his meager offering he will harbor resentment and question G-d's judgement as to why he is a poor man. Even if he justifies his criticism of Hashem by wanting to serve Hashem in a more generous and lavish fashion,  he has shown ignorance of the last <I>Mishna</I> in <I>Menachos</I> that teaches that it is not the cost of the offering that affects atonement, rather the sincerity of the one that brings the offering. Moreover, he is guilty of not appreciating Hashem's acts of kindness to him and for being an ingrate. To atone for these negative thoughts and criticisms he brings the second bird as an <I>Olah</I>, which atones for sins of <U>improper</U> thought.</P>
<P>A further example of this is found in the commentary of the Ramban (Vayikra 14:18) who notes that as part of the purification process for the <I>metzorah</I> - the one stricken with leprosy - many offerings (an <I>asham</I> - guilt offering, a <I>chatos</I>, an <I>olah</I>, and a <I>mincha</I> - meal offering) are brought, and all are expressions of atonement. Why so many? The Ramban suggests that one offering is to atone for the sin he committed before he was affected by the plague, and the additional sin offering for the sin he committed during the time of the plague. Citing from Iyov (1:22), "perhaps in his anguish he complained to Hashem". The affliction of <I>tzara'as</I> manifests itself physically upon its victim, and in addition it causes him to be removed and ostracized from the community. The shame and psychological anguish of the <I>metzora</I> must have been unbearable, Yet even in this state, lest he thought that Hashem was mistreating him, for these negative thoughts he must bring a sin offering.</P>
<P>The above two examples demonstrate how careful one must be with their thoughts, In reality it requires a strong belief in <I>hashgacha pratis</I> - Hashem's direct and personal involvement in the life of each individual, coupled with the belief that "<I>kol david rachmana l'tav avid</I>" (Berachos 60b) - all that Hashem does is for the best.</P>
<P>The Purim holiday that we are about to celebrate, if properly understood, reinforces this principle. The Talmud (Megillah 7b) teaches that "one is obligated to become intoxicated with wine on Purim until one does not know the difference between cursed is Haman and blessed is Mordechai." The Avudraham explains that since they key events of the miracle of Purim - Vashti's downfall, Esther's coronation, and Haman's execution, all occurred during a feast of wine, we commemorate the miracle by drinking on Purim. The L'vush in his commentary on the Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 695) teaches that Purim differs from Chanukah. The latter was primarily an attack against the spirit and Torah of the Jew, therefore we celebrate with lighting the menorah and <I>hallel</I> to Hashem, and there is no obligation to eat a festive meal or <I>seudas mitzvah</I>. Purim, on the other hand, was a physical threat to annihilate the Jewish people, and thus we gladden the body by eating and drinking, and one of the four <I>mitzvos</I> of the day of Purim is to eat a festive meal.</P>
<P>The Kedusha Leivi offers a novel interpretation of this famous passage of the Talmud that one is to drink until one cannot differentiate between cursed is Haman and blessed is Mordechai. Everything is for the good. Thus, even those occurrences that appear on the surface to be bad are in reality good. A case in point is Purim. Haman wanted to do great harm to the Jewish people. This certainly was bad, but note that his evil design was not only thwarted by Hashem but actually served the Jewish people well. The Talmud (Megillah 14a) states that Haman's decree did more to unify the Jewish people and bring them closer to their father in heaven than did the preaching and admonishing of all the prophets that preceded him. Thus, Purim shows that there is a more profound way of looking at events. Ordinarily, man has limited vision and understanding of events. However, when man enjoys and partakes of several glasses of wine, he loses his former limited intellectual perspective and can realize that there really <U>is</U> no difference between cursed is Haman and blessed is Mordechai, as ultimately, with G-d controlling all, it is all good.</P>

		<date><![CDATA[2004]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: tishabaav]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<P>Although we observe several Ravnic fast days throughout the
year, our commemoration of <I>Tisha Ba'av</I> is uniquely stringent.
On <I>Tisha Ba'av</I>, like <I>Yom Hakippurim</I>, we begin fasting
in the evening and observe all <I>chamishah iyunim</I>. 
</P>
<P><I>Tosfos Yeshanim</I> (<I>Megilah</I> 5b) explains that
originally <I>Tisha Ba'av</I> was similar to the other Ravnic fasts
during which only eating and drinking were forbidden. Indeed, the
<I>navi</I> Zechariah (8:9) equates <I>Tisha Ba'av</I>, the <I>tzom
hachamishi</I>, with other yearly fasts. Only later, as a separate
<I>takanah</I>, <I>Tisha Ba'av</I> was elevated to a <I>ta'anis</I>
which parallels <I>Yom Hakippurim</I>. 
</P>
<P>The Ramban however maintains that initially, all fasts included
the <I>chamishah inuyim</I>. Subsequently, however, when the
harshness of other fast days were reduced, the stringencies of <I>Tisha
Ba'av</I> remained. 
</P>
<P>The Rambam emphasizes (<I>Peirush Hamishnayos, Maseches Ta'anis</I>)
that our observance of <I>Tisha Ba'av</I> reflects two distinct
aspects of the day. <I>Tisha Ba'av</I> is not only a <I>ta'anis
tzibbur</I>, but also a day of <I>aveilus</I>. Because <I>Tisha Ba'av</I>
is a <I>ta'anis tzibbur</I> we refrain from eating and drinking. We
sit on the floor and refrain from Torah study to mark the fact that
<I>Tisha Ba'av</I> is a day of mourning. 
</P>
<P>The <I>Minchas Chinuch</I> (<I>Mitzvah</I> 312) suggests that the
<I>issur rechitzah</I>, the prohibition to wash, for example, links
these two elements. Both an <I>avel</I> as well as someone who
observes a <I>taanis tzibbur</I> are forbidden to wash. However,
whereas <I>aveilus</I> prohibits one from washing their entire body,
<I>taanis tzibbur</I> forbids one from washing a small part of the
body as well. 
</P>
<P>The <I>Minchas Chinuch</I> further suggests that when <I>Tisha
Ba'av</I> occurs on <I>Shabbos</I>, although the <I>ta'anis</I> is
observed on Sunday, various aspects of <I>avielus</I> apply even on
<I>Shabbos</I>. 
</P>
<P>The Rambam extends another element of <I>Yom Hakippurim</I> to
<I>Tisha Ba'av</I>. The <I>Gemara</I> (<I>Yoma</I> 81b) explains that
one is obligated to begin <I>Yom Hakippurim</I> early, before sunset.
The Torah obligation is determined from, "<I>Veinisem es
nafshoseichem betisha bachodesh baerev</I>, " indicating that
<I>Yom Hakippurim</I> is to begin on the ninth of <I>Tishrei</I>
towards evening. Most <I>rishonim</I> maintain that this <I>mitzvah</I>
is not limited to <I>Yom Hakippurim</I> but applies to <I>Shabbos</I>
and <I>yom tov</I> as well. The Rambam does not mention the <I>mitzvah</I>
of <I>tosefes Shabbos</I> and <I>yom tov</I> in the <I>Perush
Hamishnayos</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">; however</SPAN>, he
does emphasize the need to begin <I>Tisha Ba'av</I> early, "<I>umosifin
michol el hakodesh</I>." According to the Rambam, the <I>mitzvah</I>
of <I>tosefes</I> is not a function of <I>kiddush hayom</I>, but
rather of <I>taanis tzibbur</I>. 
</P>
<P>Our commemoration of <I>Tisha Ba'av</I> uniquely binds these
aspects of <I>taanis tzibbur</I> and <I>aveilus</I>. May our
observance be <I>meorer rachmei shomayim</I> as we await <I>biyas
goel tzedek bimhera biyameinu</I>.</P>

 <P><I>Shabbos</I> and <I>Yom Tov</I>
reflect two distinct models of <I>kedusha</I>. Although we are
obligated to recite <I>Kiddush</I> each <I>Shabbos</I>, the essence
and <I>kedusha</I> of <I>Shabbos</I> is <I>kvia vkayma</I>, set and
predetermined. This aspect of <I>Shabbos</I> is evident in the
<I>beracha</I> of &ldquo;<I>mekadesh haShabbos&rdquo;</I>.</P>

<P><I>Yom tov</I>, however,
reflects a different foray into <I>kedushas hazman</I>. The onset of
<I>yom tov</I>, which is generally linked to specific calendar dates,
is dependent on the Sanhedrin and <I>Keneses Yisroel</I> who
determine <I>Rosh Chodesh</I>. This unique element of <I>yom tov</I>
is reflected in the <I>beracha</I> of &ldquo;<I>mekadesh Yisroel
vhazmanim&rdquo;</I>.</P>

<P>The <I>Meshech Chochma</I>
explains that a similar distinction can be made between <I>Shemitah</I>
and <I>Yovel</I>. The <I>Toras Kohanim</I> comments, "<I>kshem
shene'emar b'Shabbos Bereishis 'Shabbos Lashem', kach ne'emar
b'Shevi'is Shabbos Lashem</I>". <I>Shemitah</I>, like <I>Shabbos</I>,
posses a fixed <I>kedusha</I> which is not dependent on <I>kedushas
beis din</I>. The beginning of the <I>Shemitah</I> year automatically
renders fields ownerless and prohibits the farmer from guarding and
tending his field. Similarly, the Mordechai explains, that <I>Shevi'is</I>
annuls loans, even if the lender fails to declare "<I>meshamet
ani boch</I>". The very purpose of <I>Shevi'is</I>,
which is to reaffirm "<I>ki li kol ha'aretz</I>", is an
essential theme of <I>Shabbos</I> itself.</P>

<P><I>Yovel</I>, however
parallels <I>yom tov</I>. Just as <I>Rosh Chodesh</I> and <I>yom tov
</I>require <I>kiddush beis din</I>, so too the Torah emphasizes
&ldquo;<I>v'kidashtem es shnas hachamishim shana</I>.&rdquo; the very
term &ldquo;<I>lochem</I>&rdquo; so essential to <I>kiddush hachodesh</I>
- &ldquo;<I>hachodesh hazeh lochem</I>&rdquo; - is used to describe
the essence of <I>Yovel</I> - &ldquo;<I>kadosh tihiye lochem</I>&rdquo;.
Just as <I>yom tov</I> serves as a <I>zecher l'yetsias Mitzrayim</I>,
where we acknowledge our freedom, so too <I>Yovel</I> is a time when
all Jewish slaves must be freed.</P>

<P>Both models of <I>kedusha</I>
characterize <I>kedushas Eretz Yisroel</I>. On one level, <I>Eretz
Yisroel</I> posses an inherent and intrinsic <I>kedusha</I>,
independent of <I>Keneses Yisroel</I>. Complete <I>kedushas ha'aretz</I>
however, requires the active participation of <I>Bnai Yisroel</I>.</P>

<P><I>Shemitah</I> and <I>Yovel</I>
teach us to recognize, appreciate and create <I>kedusha</I>. May we
be worthy of this lofty privilege.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[The Joy of Learning]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Yonason Sacks]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2004]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: kitissa]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




 <p>Commenting on the verse "<i>ve'asu</i><i> 
Aron</i>," the Ramban says that building
the <i>aron</i> is its own mitzvah. The 
Ramban points out that when the Torah uses the plural form
in commanding a <i>mitzva</i>, it is indicating that
the <i>mitzva</i> is incumbent upon individuals. </p>
  <p>How is the commandment of <i>ve'asu</i><i> 
Aron</i> fulfilled? The Ramban
suggests three possibilities. Either he can donate materials, participate
physically in building the <i>aron</i>, or "
<i>sheyechavnu</i><i> ladavar</i>"
- having the appropriate intentions represented by the <i>aron</i>.
If a person has the proper passion and intensity in studying the Torah, and
recognizes its primacy, he is fulfilling this aspect. The Ramban
writes in <i>Parshas</i><i> VaYakhel</i>
that the Torah describes the people who contributed to the building of the 
<i>Mishkan</i> as those who were "<i>nesa'o</i><i>
libo</i>", those who were inspired. Where does one
see that a measure of inspiration was necessary to be involved in the building
of the <i>Mishkan</i>? The Ramban
pointes out that if a person wants to build a magnificent edifice for G-d, one
would normally look for experienced workers to build it. The Jewish people had
no training, no experience, and no resume. How can an untrained laborer build
such a stunning structure? Apparently, inspiration and dedication can overcome
even objective difficulty. If a person is motivated and acts with effort, he
can accomplish building the <i>Mishkan</i>, as the
verse in Divrei HaYamim
says, "<i>VaYigba</i><i> Libo
BeDarkei Hashem</i>" ("and
his heart was elevated in the ways of G-d"). </p>
  <p>Sometimes, when studying Torah, one can fall into moments of despair. The
Torah is so vast - how can one continue to acquire more Torah knowledge?
Recalling and being proficient in past materials learnt is difficult enough,
let alone achieving mastery of the entire Torah. The answer is that when a
person is inspired, and has the proper passion, this can be accomplished. </p>
  <p>The Sefer HaChinuch
writes that <i>birchas</i><i> haTorah
</i>and <i>birchas</i><i> hamazon</i>
are both blessings of thanks, but with one major difference between the two.
Whereas one cannot make a blessing of thanks on food until finishing eating and
being satiated, one must make a blessing of thanks on learning Torah even
before commencing to learn. This is because one must realize the splendor and privilege
of studying Torah before actually doing so.</p>
  <p>The <i>Gemara</i> in <i>Nedarim</i>
(81) comments that the reason the land
 of Israel was destroyed was because
they did not say <i>birchas</i><i> 
haTorah </i>before studying Torah. The Elglei
Tal writes in his introduction that many 
<i>bnei</i><i> Torah</i> make the mistake of thinking that
the process of maintaining concentration and achieving <i>hasmada</i>
is an excruciating one. In fact, he writes, quite the opposite should be true -
the study of Torah must be something accompanied by enjoyment. When 
Tosfos says that the blessing of <i>la'asok</i><i>
bedivrei</i> Torah is connected to the phrase 
<i>veha'arev</i><i> na</i> - make
pleasant - by a <i>vav</i>, and is therefore one
blessing, that is not just by way of teaching us a <i>halacha</i>
in <i>bracha</i><i> hasmucha
lechaverta</i>, but also teaching a life lesson in
how to relate to the study of Torah. </p>

<P>The <I>gemara</I> (<I>Megillah</I> 31b) explains that Ezra <I>Hasofer</I>
established the practice of reading the <I>klalos sheb'Toras Kohanim</I>,
the curses found in <I>Vayikra</I> (26) before the <I>yom tov</I> of
<I>Shavuos</I>, and those of <I>Sefer Devarim</I> (28) prior to Rosh
Hashana. Tosafos add, in the name of Rabbeinu Nissim, that the <I>klalos</I>
of <I>Sefer Devarim</I>, which begin in <I>Parshas Ki Savo</I>,
include part of <I>Parsah Nitzavim</I> as well. Because of this
<I>takonas</I> Ezra, we always read <I>Parshas Nitzavim</I> on the
<I>Shabbos</I> before Rosh Hashana.</P>

<P>The Gaon of Vilna highlights an essential difference between the
<I>tochacha</I> found in <I>Vayikra</I> and the <I>berachos u'kallos</I>
of <I>Devarim</I>. The <I>tochacha</I> in <I>Vayikra</I> is
formulated in the <U>plural</U>,
"<I>im b'chukosai timasu</I>", addressing <I>kol echad
v'echad</I>, each individual member of <I>Klal Yisroel</I>. The
<I>berachos u'klalos</I> of <I>Sefer Devarim</I>, however, which are
statements in the <U>singular</U>,
embrace the totality of <I>Keneses Yisroel</I>. This collective
quality is emphasized by the <I>pesukim</I> of <I>Parshas Nitzavim</I>
which follow the <I>tochacha</I>, "<I>v'lo itchem l'vadchem
anochi koreis es habris hazos v'es ha'ala hazos</I>" <I>Devarim</I>
(29:13) - "not with you alone do I seal this covenant and this
imprecation." Rashi explains that the phrase "<I>v'lo
itchem l'vadchem</I>" includes even <I>doros hasidim l'hiyos</I>,
future generations. Indeed, the <I>gemara</I> (<I>Sanhedrin</I> 43b
and <I>Sotah</I> 36b) explains that the principal of communal
responsibility - <I>kol Yisroel areivim zeh bozeh</I> -
is rooted in this <I>parsha.</I></P>

<P>The Rambam (<I>Sefer Hanitzvos
Shoresh</I> 3) questions the view of the Halachos
Gedolos, who together with Rav Saddia Gaon lists <I>berachos
u'klalos</I> as one of the 613 <I>mitzvos</I>. In what sense do these
<I>berachos</I> constitute a <I>mitzvah l'doros</I>?</P>

<P>Rav Yeruchum Perlow (<I>Sefer
Hamitzvos L'Rav Saddia Gaon, Perek</I> 57) suggests that the Halachos
Gedolos was not referring to the ceremony and process of the <I>tochacha</I>
which was only a <I>hora'as sha'a</I>, but rather to the principle of
<I>arvus</I> which is derived from this <I>parsha.</I></P>

<P>The reading of the <I>berachos
u'klalos</I> before Rosh Hashana remind us of the uniqueness of
<I>kedushas Yisroel</I>. May we be worthy of the fervent <I>beracha -
 shetichle shana v'kililoseha</I> -
that the conclusion of the year should mark an end of all tragedy and
suffering.</P>

		<title><![CDATA[The Legacy of Yaakov <i>Avinu</i>]]></title>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vayechi]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<p>The death of Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> not only marks the end of <i>Sefer Bereishis</i>, but also the end of an era. The Ramban, in his introduction to <i>Sefer</i><i> 
Shemos</i> poignantly explains: "<i>Hishlim hakasuv Sefer Bereishis shehu sefer yetzira bechidush haolam, veyetziras kol notzar, uvemikrai haavos shehem 
k'inyan yetzira lezar'am</i> - the Torah completes <i>Sefer Bereishis</i> which is the account of creation as well as a record of all that happened to the forefathers who are a form of 
creation to their seed." In so many ways, the triumphs and challenges Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> serve as a moral guide and, as the Ramban terms, a <i>yetzira</i>,  a creation for all 
generations.</p>

<p>The <i>Meshech Chochmah</i> observes that twice, first in <i>Parshas</i><i> Vayetze</i> (28:11-12), and later in <i>Vayigash</i> (56:2), the Torah emphasizes that <i>Hakadosh 
Baruch Hu</i> appears to Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> at night, <i>bemaros halayla</i>. Although Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> was forced to leave <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> and endure the difficulties of 
<i>galus</i>, <i>HKB"H</i> reassures him, specifically at night, that even <i>becheshkas hagalus</i> (in the darkness of exile) one can experience  <i>hashra'as hashechinah</i>- Divine Revelation.</p>

<p>Although all of the <i>avos</i> (forefathers) engaged in <i>tefilla</i>, Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> instituted <i>Tefillas Arvis</i>, the evening prayer. He taught us the 
appropriateness of <i>tefilla</i> when one is surrounded by darkness. </p>

<p>The <i>Meshech Chochmah</i> explains that especially during <i>galus</i>, one must embrace <i>darchei ha'avos</i>, the paths and priorities of our forefathers. 
Just as a <i>korban</i> can only continue to burn at night if it was offered during the day, and just as a <i>navi</i> can only merit prophecy in <i>chutz
laaretz</i> if he experiences <i>nevuah</i> in <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> first, so too our <i>avodas Hashem</i> in <i>galus</i> must emulate and embrace <i>derech ha'avos</i>.</p>

<p>The Zohar (vol. 1, 146b) comments "<i>Al sheloshah devarim haolam omed: Hatorah - da Yaakov, haavodah - da Yitzchak, gemilus chassadim - da Avraham</i>." Each of the 
<i>avos</i> represents a pillar on which the world stands. The <i>middah</i> of Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> is Torah.</p>

<p>May we, as descendants of Yaakov <i>Avinu</i>, embrace this legacy, enabling the light of Torah to permeate the darkness of  <i>galus</i>.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vayetse]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<P>The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Berachos</i> 26b) cites two different
sources for our daily <i>tefillos</i>. According to Rebbe Yosi b'rebbe Chanina,
our <i>tefillos</i> were instituted by the <i>avos</i>. Rebbe Yehoshua ben Levi
however maintains that our <i>tefillos </i>correspond to the daily <i>korbanos</i>.</p>



<P>The <i>Gemara</i> subsequently (27b) disputes the nature of <i>tefillas
arvis</i>. Rabban Gamliel maintains that <i>tefillas arvis chova</i>, that the <i>maariv
tefilla </i>is compulsory, whereas Rebbe Yehoshua argues that <i>tefillas arvis
reshus</i>, that <i>maariv</i> is elective.</p>



<P>Although the <i>Gemara</i> never connects these two themes, Rashi
(<i>Shabbos</i> 9b) explains that the source and extent of our obligation to <i>daven</i>
<i>maariv</i> are clearly linked. If <i>tefilla</i> is rooted in the practice
of the <i>avos</i>, there is no difference between <i>shacharis</i>, <i>mincha</i>,
and <i>maariv</i>. According to Rebbe Yehoshua ben Levi, however, who bases <i>tefilla</i>
on <i>korbanos</i>, one can easily distinguish between <i>shacharis</i> and <i>mincha,</i>
which are patterned after fixed <i>korbanos</i>, and <i>maariv,</i> which does
not correspond to a particular <i>korban</i>, but rather to the remaining parts
of the <i>korban</i> which would burn through the night.</p>



<P>The Netziv, however, observes (<i>Sheilta</i> 8) that this
cannot be the view of Rebbe Achai Gaon. Although the <i>Sheiltos</i> maintains <i>tefillas
arvis reshus</i> (<i>maariv</i> is elective) he nevertheless cites the source
of Rebbe Yosi b'rebbe Chanina basing <i>tefilla</i> on the <i>avos</i>. Why
however, should the <i>tefilla </i>of Yaakov <i>avinu</i> be any different than
the <i>tefillos</i> of Avraham and Yitzchok?</p>



<P>The Netziv explains that an answer can be found in the very
phrase <i>vayifga bamakom</i>, he encountered the place, which describes the <i>tefilla
</i>of Yaakov <i>avinu</i>. The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Chulin</i> 91b) comments "<i>ki
mata l'Charan amar, efshar avarti al makom shehispalelu avosai va'ani lo hispalalti</i>?"
- "when Yaakov reached Charan he exclaimed, how could I have passed the place
where my fathers <i>davened</i> and not have davened there myself?"</p>



<P>Unlike the <i>tefillos</i> of Avraham and Yitzchok, when the
Torah simply states that they davened, here the <i>passuk</i> attributes the <i>tefilla</i>
of Yaakov <i>avinu</i> to a particular time and place. Apparently, the <i>tefilla</i>
of Yaakov was not a categorical obligation, but rather a response to his unique
circumstance. If so, the Netziv observes, the view of Rebbe Yehoshua who holds <i>tefillas
arvis reshus</i> can be understood based on the <i>tefilla</i> of Yaakov <i>avinu</i>.</p>



<P><i>Tefillas arvis</i>, which was instituted by Yaakov <i>avinu</i>,
emphasizes the appropriateness of <i>tefilla</i> when one is surrounded by
darkness. The Meshech Chochmo explains (<i>Braishis</i> 46:2) that twice, <i>Hakadosh
Baruch Hu</i> appeared to Yaakov <i>avinu</i> at night, <i>b'maros layla</i>. Although
Yaakov <i>avinu</i> was forced to leave <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> and endure the
difficulties of <i>galus</i>, <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i> reassures him,
specifically at night, that even <i>b'cheshkas hagalus</i> one can experience <i>hashroas
hashechina</i>.</p>



<P>May we, the descendants of Yaakov <i>avinu</i>, embrace the
priorities of our <i>avos</i>, enabling the light of Torah and <i>tefilla</i>
to permeate the darkness of <i>galus</i>.</p>

<P>The <I>mishna</I> (<I>Avos</I> 5:22) contrasts the character
traits of Avraham <I>Avinu</I> and Bilaam <I>Ha-rasha</I>.
Interestingly, the Tiferes Yisroel notes that Avraham's very name is
an acronym for &ldquo;<I>av ha-mon goyim</I> &ndash; father of a
multitude of nations&rdquo;, as he taught monotheism and ethical
character to all of humanity. Thus, by emulating his traits, even a
non-Jew can become a disciple of Avraham. The three traits of
Avraham: a good eye, one who is not jealous of the next one's
success; a humble spirit, possessing humility and modesty; and an
undemanding soul &ndash; one who exercises restraint and
self-control. In contrast, those who possess an evil eye, an arrogant
spirit and a greedy soul, are classified as followers of the wicked
Bilaam.</P>
<P>The <I>mishna</I> then continues with a rhetorical question: how
are the students of our forefather Avraham different from the
students of the wicked Bilaam? The disciples of Avraham enjoy (the
fruit of their good deeds) in this world and inherit the world to
come. The disciples of the wicked Bilaam inherit <I>Gehinom</I>
(purgatory) and descend into the well of destruction (the <I>mishna</I>
cites verses to substantiate the above).</P>
<P>At first glance, we might have understood sentence of <I>Gehinom</I>
for the wicked to refer to <I>olam ha-bah</I>, their due punishment
in the world to come. However, the Meiri in his commentary notes, in
contrast to the righteous who reap reward in this world, the wicked
experience Hell already on Earth. Those who suffer from greed,
arrogance, and lust cannot and do not enjoy even this world! They
cannot and do not enjoy what they have, if others have what appears
to them to be more and better.</P>
<P>We are taught in the Talmud (<I>Kiddushin</I> 39b) &ldquo;the
reward for <I>mitzvos</I> is not in
this world.&rdquo; In addition, in <I>Avos</I> (1:3) Antignos taught,
&ldquo;be not as servants who serve the Master for the sake of
receiving a reward.&rdquo; Yet, our <I>mishna</I> teaches that the
very observance of Torah and living its <I>middos</I> (character
traits) <U>does</U> provide the
highest form of reward (i.e. personal contentment) even in this
world.</P>
<P><I>Shir Hashirim</I>
(5:16) states, &ldquo;His palate is sweet, and he is altogether
desirable.&rdquo; Rashi explains that His decrees of the Torah are
sweet, as Hashem commands in <I>Vayikra</I> (19:28) &ldquo;you shall
not make a wound in your flesh for one who has died ... I am the
Lord.&rdquo; Is there a palate sweeter than this? Do not wound
yourself, and for this Hashem promises a reward! The reward is thus
not only in the world to come, but here and now He protects and
guards our physical bodies, and through the positive noble character
traits of Avraham, He enhances and protects our psychological
well-being as well. Reb Yeruchum zt&rdquo;l, <I>mashgiach</I> of the
Mirer Yeshiva, noted that it's not only the example cited above by
Rashi that enhances our life, but indeed all of Torah is a formula
for &ldquo;<I>ashrecha baolam hazeh</I>&rdquo;, your well-being in
this world.</P>
<P>The above is
encapsulated in the insightful teaching of the Vilan Gaon &ndash; in
his <I>Aderes Eliyahu</I> on <I>Vayikra</I> (18:5), &ldquo;you shall
observe My decrees and My laws, which man shall carry out and <I>v'chai
b'hem</I> - by which he shall live &ndash; I am Hashem.&rdquo; The
Gr&rdquo;a understands <I>v'chai b'hem</I> literally. The observance
of <I>mitzvos</I> yields goodness and quality to our lives. Thus, he
understands the end of the verse to mean I am Hashem, who is
instructing you to observe these <I>mitzvos</I> because I commanded
them, rather than observe them because they are good for you and
provide meaning and quality to your life.</P>
<P>Shabbos is the
<I>yom m'nucha </I>and<I>
kedusha.</I> In addition, it binds and bonds the family. Without a
proper <I>halachik</I> observance of <I>Shabbos</I>, one not only
loses out on the rituals of Torah, but also on the social benefits as
well.</P>
<P>The expression
of &ldquo;sweet revenge&rdquo; is antithetical to a Torah
personality. To the contrary, the Talmud (<I>Chulin</I> 89a) teaches
that the world exists only on account of the one who restrains
himself in strife.</P>
<P>Finally, the
Rama concludes his commentary to <I>Orach Chaim</I> by citing the
verse &ldquo;t<I>ov lev mishta tamid</I>&rdquo;, which the Gr&rdquo;a
understands to mean a person with a generous heart and disposition
enjoys a state of being of contentment and happiness, always.</P>

<P>A yeshiva student of Novardok was thrown into jail by the Communists.
They did not allow him to have <i>seforim</i> in jail, but did permit him to
receive food parcels. His family decided to wrap the food in a <i>daf</i> of <i>gemarah</i>.
The question arose, should they use an old frayed <i>gemarah</i> or a new one?
The answer was a new one, as the older one has a greater degree of <i>kedusha</i>
(sanctity).</p>



<P>Reverence for the past begins with Avraham <i>Avinu</i>. The
Torah teaches, "And <i>Avraham</i> had become old and advanced in days, and Hashem
blessed Avraham with everything" (<i>Braishis</i> 24:1). The Talmud (<i>Bava Metzia</i>
87a) teaches that until Avraham, there were no visual signs of old age, and Avraham
prayed for recognizable old age to come into existence, and Hashem responded in
the affirmative. The medrash (<i>Braishis Rabbah</i> 65) teaches that Avraham
argued before Hashem thata man and his son could walk together and no one would
know whom to honor. Thus signs of aging were a gift from Hashem, to enable the
younger generation to show reverence and respect for a life of accomplishment.
Grey hair is not to be camouflaged but to be flaunted as a crown of glory. This
is in sharp contrast to the subsequent teaching of the gemarah, that until Yaakov
there was no illness. Yaakov prayed to Hashem that mankind be afforded a
warning that their end might be approaching, enabling them to put their life
and affairs in order in preparation for the next world.</p>



<P>The old age of Avraham is one of blessing, fulfillment, and
accomplishment. This can only be understood from a spiritual perspective. From
a physical perspective the senior years are marked by a significant diminution
of physical strength, prowess, and accomplishment. Avraham wanted old age so
that the elderly would be venerated. Indeed, Rav Yochanan would greet and rise
before the elderly of even the non-Jewish community (<i>Kiddushin</i> 33a),
stating that they have weathered the various storms of life, and have graduated
from the school of hard knocks. </p>



<P>The Gemarah (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 97b) teaches that the coin of
Avraham <i>Avinu</i> had an elderly couple on one side, and a young couple on
the other. Rashi understands this to refer to Avraham and Sarah on one side,
and Yitzchak and Rivka on the reverse. The Maharsha, however, explains the coin
to refer exclusively to Avraham and Sarah. To enable them to have Yitzchak they
were miraculously transformed to younger individuals. They underwent a renewal.</p>



<P>Perhaps this is the reason for the custom as found in many <i>siddurim</i>
that recommend that upon completion of <i>Hallel</i> on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>,
one recite the verse, "<i>V'Avraham zakein bo bayomim, v'Hashem beirach es Avraham
bakol</i>" - "now Avraham was old, well on in years, and Hashem had blessed Avraham
with everything" (<i>Braishis</i> 24:1). <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> is a time of
renewal. Renewal of the moon, and our taking note of Hashem's renewal of nature
affords us an opportunity to renew our relationship with <u>Him</u>. In
addition, as Avraham and Sarah experienced renewal so must we.</p>



<P>While their renewal was more physical in nature, our Ravs
note that a spiritual transformation occurs as well. The <i>Mishna</i> (<i>Kinim</i>
3:6) makes a sharp distinction between the aging of "<i>amei haaretz</i>", the
unlearned, who seek but personal gratification, and the learned. The former,
commensurate with the lessening of their physical capacity and pleasures,
experience a void and emptiness that robs them of their meaning and purpose in
life. In contrast, the latter, despite the same bodily decline, their
attainment of spiritual endeavors increases and flourishes, fulfilling the
verse "<i>od yenuvun b'saiva</i>" - "they will still be fruitful in old age,
even vigorous and fresh", (Psalms 92:15).</p>



<P>The Abarbanel in his explanation of the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>yovel</i>
(Jubilee year - <i>Vayikra</i> 25:8-13) echoes the above theme. He teaches that
the Torah is alluding to the fifty years of working on behalf of family and
society. The remaining years are to be an opportunity for the <u>personal</u>
self-actualization that was often limited in one's earlier years. Enrolling in
a <i>kollel</i> for senior citizens, attending <i>shiurim</i> and bringing
satisfaction to others through many different <i>chessed</i> opportunities, can
adorn one's life with a new sense of personal growth, purpose, and meaning.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




  <p>We find throughout the Book of Yehoshua
that <i>B'nai</i><i> Yisroel</i>
captured <i>Eretz</i><i> Yisroel</i>
with relative ease. Their first conquest was that of Yericho,
and because of the miraculous way in which the city fell to them, it was understood
that they would not take of the spoils. They, the people, were not the real
victors, but rather Hashem was. It is thus perplexing
that we find (Yehoshua 15:16)
Kalev making the following declaration, "Whoever will
conquer D'vir, which was formerly known as 
Qiryat Sefer, I will give my
daughter Achsha as a wife". We are then told that 
Osneal ben Knaz
conquers it and is given Achsha as a wife. Why was
this particular section of the land more difficult to conquer? The Book of 
Yehoshua does not inform us, but the <i>Gemara</i>
(<i>Temurah</i> 16a) gives us a significant clue.</p>
  <p>The above cited <i>Gemara</i>
teaches that when Moshe died, 300 <i>halachos</i>
were forgotten by the people. Osneal restored them
using his understanding and erudition of the oral law. The text that the 
<i>Gemara</i> uses to prove that he restored these laws is
the verse from Yehoshua that teaches that us that he
conquered Qiryat Sefer.
What might be the connection between these two subjects?</p>
  <p>HaRav Dovid
Shlomo Eibshitz 
z"l, the author of the <i>L'vush</i>
on <i>Yoreh</i><i> Deah</i>
and <i>Orach</i><i> Chaim</i>,
writes a most fascinating idea in his <i>sefer</i><i>
Arvei Nachal</i> (
<i>Parshas</i><i> Shelach</i>, 
<i>Drush</i> 2). The reason that the Jewish nation
conquered <i>Eretz</i><i> Yisroel</i>
with relative ease is because the Torah is the blueprint of the world. "
<i>Histakel</i><i> b'Oraysa 
u'bara </i><i>alma</i>"
- Hashem looked in the Torah and created the world. 
<i>Eretz</i><i> Yisroel</i> is
inextricably metaphysically bound with the Torah, and indeed the Torah provides
the very life and vitality to the land. Each part of Torah maintains a
particular piece of land in <i>Eretz</i><i> 
Yisroel</i>. Thus it is understandable that their primary
preparation for the conquest of the land was not a military academy. Rather
their training at <i>Har</i><i> Sinai</i>, where
their acceptance of Torah and their commitment to its perpetuation enabled them
to conquer the land. When Moshe died and they forgot 300 Torah laws, they were
lacking the spiritual munitions to conquer D'vir. 
Osneal conquered not only with the sword, but more
importantly with the restoration of the <i>sefer</i>,
by his Torah, as alluded to in the name Qiryat 
Sefer. </p>
  <p>What is true regarding Osneal is
true regarding each and every Jew. The <i>Zohar</i>
teaches that the very name <i>Yisroel</i> is an
acronym for 600,000 letters of Torah corresponding to 600,000 Jewish souls ("
<i>yesh</i><i> shishim 
rivo osiyos laTorah</i>").
Each Jew has his own individual portion of Torah. It is for this reason,
suggests the <i>Arvei</i><i> Nachal</i>,
that the land of Israel
was divided by lottery, under Divine supervision. Not only did this prevent any
quarrel and jealousy among the people regarding their particular part, in
addition it precisely matched every individuals "portion", his mastery of - and
commitment to - Torah, with his parcel of land. Each settler provided unique
nourishment to the soil.</p>
  <p>The Jew prays (at least thrice daily) regularly, "
<i>v'sain</i><i> chelkainu 
b'sorasecha</i>" - may we actualize our unique potential in
your Torah. Each person, given his intellect, desire, and circumstances, acquires
his portion of Torah. In the <i>Shabbos</i><i> 
Mussaf</i> we beseech Hashem,
return us to <i>Eretz</i><i> Yisroel</i>,
"<i>v'sitoeainu</i><i> b'gvulainu</i>"
- implant us in our "boundary". With the insight of the <i>Arvei</i><i>
Nachal</i> we now have a deeper and more personally
relevant understanding of these prayers.</p>
  <p>Finally, in <i>Parshas</i><i> 
Kedoshim </i>(19:23)
we read, "when you shall come to the land and you shall plant any food tree..". The <i>Ohr</i><i> 
HaChaim Hakadosh</i> reminds us
that often beyond the literal explanation, a much deeper thought is being
presented. He reminds us that often the word <i>eitz</i>
(tree) refers to a <i>tzadik</i>. In 
<i>Parhas</i><i> Shlach</i> when
Moshe instructs the <i>meraglim</i> (spies) as to
what to note, he asks them (<i>Bamidbar</i> 13:20) "are there trees in it?" Of course
Moshe knew three were trees, rather he was asking in keeping with the Talmud (
<i>Bava</i><i> Basra</i> 15a) "is there among them a
righteous man who can protect them through his merit - as a tree protects." R. 
Yose (<i>Shabbos</i> 118b) refers
to his five sons - all of whom were prominent men - as five cedars within the
Jewish people. Similarly (<i>Devarim</i> 20:19) "do not destroy its trees" is
understood by the <i>Zohar</i> to mean its educated
men. Thus, our verse which teaches us the importance of planting trees in Israel
is referring not only to the earthly ecology, but also to a higher one as well,
namely when you come into the land, educate your children in Torah, as the land
itself yearns for its Torah, and assist the student to acquire more of it.</p>

<P>It is interesting to note that Rav Saadia Gaon counts among the
t<I>aryag</I> (613) <I>mitzvos</I>
the convocation ceremony that happened at Har Grizim and Har Eival on
the day that the Jewish nation crossed the Jordan. The Torah in
Parshas Ki Tavo (Ch. 27) details the exact manner that the new
immigrants to the land were to gather - six tribes on Har Grizim and
six tribes on Har Eival. The Kohanim and Levi'im stood in between the
two mountains and first pronounced blessings to the nation if they
keep the Torah, and then curses if they do not.</P>
<P>Most commentaries do not count this
happening as one of the 613 <I>mitzvos</I>, as it was an experience
that occurred but once. By definition <I>mitzvos</I> are eternal,
thus the placing of the blood on the door post in Egypt is not
counted as a <I>mitzvah</I>. Rav Yeruchum Perlow explains that this
is the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>arvus</I> &ndash; collective
responsibility that the Jewish nation entered into at this time. The
<I>mitvzah</I> is not to regroup at the mountain but to practice and
live by &ldquo;<I>kol Yisroel araivim zeh lazeh</I>&rdquo; (all
Israel is responsible for one another.)</P>
<P>This is the source and foundation for
the important <I>halachic </I>principle of <I>yatzah-motzi</I>. Under
normal circumstances, once an individual has fulfilled a particular
<I>mitzvah</I> he is <U>not</U>
given a second chance to fulfill that <I>mitzvah</I> again. Case in
point: one who has recited <I>kiddush</I> Friday night cannot recite
the <I>kiddush</I> again, claiming for example that he or she lacked
proper <I>kavanah</I>( concentration) the first time. Yet, the same
individual, should he go for a walk that night and encounter a Jew
who has not yet recited/heard <I>kiddush</I>,  is obligated to recite
<I>kiddush</I> for him, as all Israel is responsible one to another.</P>
<P>The meaning of
the word &ldquo;<I>areiv</I>&rdquo; in the above context is that of a
co-signer. As in a loan, the co-signer assumes responsibility for
payment if the borrower renegs on his obligation, similarly each Jew
is responsible to see that his fellow Jew observes Torah and <I>mitzvos</I>.
Your <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>shofar, lulav, sukkah</I> and <I>T'fillin</I>
are  incomplete if your neighbor has not yet fulfilled the <I>mitzvah</I>,
and you can positively correct the situation. 
</P>
<P>The Noam
Elimelech suggests another interpretation to the word <I>areiv</I> in
light of the passage in Shir Hashirim (2:14) - &ldquo;<I>ki koleich
areiv</I>&rdquo; - &ldquo;for your voice is sweet&rdquo; -  <I>kol
Yisroel araivim zeh lazeh - </I>all Israel sweetens one another. It
is not coincidental that we read <I>Ki Tavo</I> and <I>Nitzavim</I>
each year prior to Rosh Hashana. We are taught &ldquo;<I>tichleh
shanah v'killoseha</I>&rdquo; = may the year with its curses and
adverse circumstances come to a close. I'd like to suggest that the
<I>mitzvah </I>of <I>arvus </I>is a critical one, especially at this
time of the year.</P>
<P>Rosh Hashanah is
a two day holiday even in Eretz Yisroel. The Talmud Rosh Hashanah
(30b) gives an interesting <I>halachik </I>explanation. Rav Dessler
(<I>Michtav M'ELiyahu</I> vol. 2) cites a fascinating Zohar (<I>Parsha
Pinchas</I>) which offers the following philosophical approach: The
first day of <I>Rosh Hashanah</I> is a <I>dina kasha</I> &ndash;
rough/strict judgment, while the second day is that of <I>dina rafya</I>
&ndash; soft judgment. Rav Desler then brings the explanation of the
Arizal to the above. The first day of <I>Rosh Hashanah</I> each
individual is judged as an individual, how they fared with their
unique individual potential. Each person has character traits and
understanding that is exclusively theirs. The Talmud (Berachos 58a)
teaches that just as each person's facial features are unique, so is
their perception and intelligence. How one either elevated or used
and abused their individual personal gifts and potential is judged on
day one. All too often the result is that man is found to be lacking,
hence <I>dina kasha</I> &ndash; difficult judgment.</P>
<P>The second day
however, explains the Arizal, man is judged as part of the <I>klal</I>,
his being a member of <I>Klal Yisroel</I>. Here there is greater
opportunity for <I>dina rafa</I> &ndash; softer/kinder judgment as
each individual contributes  - <I>areivim</I> &ndash; sweetens and
enhances the community. Your praying with a minyan in synagogue as
opposed to praying alone at home is not only a higher quality
personal mitzvah but each participant contributes to <I>&ldquo;brov
am hadras melech.</I>&rdquo; The quality not just quantity of one
minyan is enhanced by each individual . Moreover, note the text of
the berachos of the Shemoneh Esreh- they are all couched in the
plural. We do not only pray for our health, wealth, and personal
redemption but include the rest of Klal Yisroel as well. 
</P>
<P>As each person
is singular &ndash; unique &ndash; so too is their prayer on behalf
of the Jewish nation. Thus, each one is needed. Therefore a most
important way to prepare for Rosh Hashanah is to focus your prayers
properly on behalf of the community enabling one to merit a positive
judgement on Rosh Hashanah.</P>
<P>Finally, before
Rosh Hashana pause and reflect how you can sweeten the lives of those
around you. The smile that you bring to the faces of the senior
citizens you visit, either alone or with your children, your
telephone call to the shut-in inquiring of their well-being, Your
greeting a newcomer to shul with a warm welcome as opposed to
ignoring him. These are but a few practical  methods of implementing
the lesson of the Noam Elimelech. Make a conscious effort to sweeten
the next one's day as there is no telling how it will impact on your
life. 
</P>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Benjamin Yudin]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2004]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: terumah]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<p>The <i>mishkan</i> served as the
religious center during the forty years that the fledgling Jewish nation
tRaveled in the dessert, and was the hub of spirituality in the land
 of Israel until David/
Shlomo built the <i>Beis</i><i> 
Hamikdash</i> in Yerushalayim. The
Ramban explains that just as at Sinai the entire
nation camped around the mountain, similarly when they tRaveled from Sinai, the
<i>mishkan</i> was at the center of the camp. The 
<i>mishkan</i><i> /mikdash</i>
unified the people. There is no Mitzvah for any individual to build a 
<i>mikdash</i>,
rather it is incumbent upon the Jewish nation. It was to the 
<i>mishkan</i><i> / mikdash</i> that
they came thrice yearly to celebrate the pilgrim festivals and to bring the
prescribed offerings. Once we were privileged to build a <i>Beis</i><i>
HaMikdash</i>, the Torah distinctly prohibited the
offering of <i>korbanos</i> in any other location.</p>
  <p>In addition, the ability to develop a close relationship
with Hashem is attainable by every individual
wherever in the world they might live. The individual keeping 
Shabbos, kashrus, and studying Torah can attain a personal
closeness with Hashem. However, it is only when the
nation is united in its pursuit of sanctity that there is a concept of kingship
(government), sanctity of the Temple
and sanctity of the community serving Hashem. This is
only attainable in <i>Eretz</i><i> 
Yisrael</i>.</p>
  <p>With the above, we can now more fully understand a
perplexing teaching of the Talmud (<i>Megillah</i>
12a) regarding the threat of Purim. The Talmud asks: what might the Jewish
people have sinned so terribly that they deserved "<i>l'hasmid</i><i>
laharog l'abed 
es kol hayehudim</i>"
- to G-d forbid destroy the entire Jewish nation? The Talmud gives two answers,
both of which are puzzling on the surface. The first answer is that they
worshipped <i>avodah</i><i> zarah</i>
- idolatry. However, a more careful analysis reveals that it was not actual
idolatry, but "<i>avak</i>" idolatry, behavior that
resembled idol worship, as they bowed to the image of Nebuchadnezzer.
While surely a serious offense, at first glance it doesn't warrant such a harsh
punishment. </p>
  <p>The second response is even more difficult. 
Rashbi teaches that they were "<i>nehene</i><i>
mei'seudas Achashverosh</i>"
- they attended and participated in the party of Achashverosh.
What, however, was their crime? Lest we think that they partook of a non-kosher
meal, the <i>Megillah</i> explicitly states "
<i>hashtiyah</i><i> ka'das</i>"
which the Talmud understands (<i>Megillah</i> 12a) to
mean that the king satisfied the individual dietary needs of each person,
including kosher food. Even the wine was <i>mevushal</i>.
So wherein lies the gRave offense? HaRav
Yitzchak HaCohen Kook zt"l
and Reb Yosef 
Salant zt"l in his 
Be'er Yosef suggest a fascinating
response. They remind us of the prophecy of Yirmiyahu
that the Jewish people would return to their land after seventy years. 
<i>Achashverosh</i> miscalculated and believed that the
seventy years had passed and the prophecy proved to be false. The
Jewish people were not returning home. He was therefore celebrating the demise
and downfall of the Jewish nation. Of course, if any Jew wanted to keep Kosher
they could in <st1:country-region>Persia</st1:country-region>,
but the nation, the people of <st1:country-region>Israel</st1:country-region>,
had lost its purpose.</p>
  <p>Thus the Talmud understands that when we are told that he
donned "<i>bigdei</i><i> malchus</i>"
- royal garb, it refers to the <i>bigdei</i><i> 
kehuna</i> - priestly garments, and specifically that of
the <i>kohen</i><i> gadol</i>.
Moreover, he displayed the relics of the Temple
that would no longer be needed. Thus, their participation in this party was an
agreement that no redemption/salvation was necessary - they could remain Jews
in <st1:country-region>Persia</st1:country-region>.</p>
  <p>Mordechai tried to persuade the
nation not to attend. There is much more than individual observance of
mitzvoth. Moreover, if the Jewish people forsake their sacred mission of being
a holy nation, a holy people, then they lose their right to survive as a people.
Their attending the party of Achashverosh had much
deeper meaning. We can now appreciate Mordechai's
plea not to attend, as he was advocating a difficult theological-religious
perspective, the importance of the nation on their land.</p>
  <p>We can now understand the response of Mordechai
who leads the people to <i>teshuva</i> (repentance).
Firstly, he tells Esther "<i>lech</i><i> 
k'nos es kol
hayehudim</i>" - "gather the entire Jewish nation".
The people need to be awakened regarding their belonging to a nation. Personal
participation in Torah and <i>mitzvos</i> is
insufficient. Secondly, he awakens the desire to return home to <st1:country-region>Israel</st1:country-region>
and build the <i>Beis</i><i> HaMikdash</i>.
The <i>Medrash</i> teaches that the Jewish nation
fasted on the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth of Nissan to cancel the
evil decree of Haman and Achashverosh.
When Haman finds Mordechai
to implement the king's order of parading Mordechai
throughout the city in an honorable way to express the king's appreciation, he
finds Mordechai teaching the innocent Jewish
children. Does it really make a difference what the subject of his lesson was?
Why does the <i>gemorah</i> (<i>Megillah</i>
16a) inform us that he was expounding the laws of <i>kemitzah</i>
and <i>korban</i><i> omer</i>,
the offering brought on the sixteenth of Nissan? HaRav
Kook zt"l explained that this was to maintain their
hopes and aspirations for <i>shivas</i><i> 
tzion</i>,
return to Zion. The 
<i>korban</i><i> omer</i> was not
brought by any one individual, rather one offering was
brought on behalf of the entire nation. In unified the people in spirit and in
practice.</p>
  <p>The Raavad teaches that 
<i>Taanis</i> Esther is most unique, in that all other
fasts have an element of sadness and tragedy, while this fast is one of 
<i>simcha</i>, happiness. Happiness that
we were victorious over our enemies, and especially that we did not loose a
single soldier. In addition, our fasting reminds us of their fasting for
three days, which brought about the unification of the Jewish nation and
ultimately our <i>geulah</i>. May we, through our
fasting, be so privileged to bring happiness and hasten our 
<i>geulah</i>.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[





<P>The <i>Medrash Sochar Tov</i> (<i>Mishlei, Parsha</i> 9)
distinguishes between Purim and the other festive days of the year:

<BLOCKQUOTE>"kol hamoadim betailim v'yemei haPurim lo yiheyu betailim shene'emar
'v'yemei haPurim ho'eille v'lo ya'avru mitoch haYehudim v'zichram lo yasuf mizaram'
(Esther, 9:28) - All festivals will cease with the exception of Purim, as it is
written, and these days of Purim shall never cease among the Jews, nor shall
their remembrance perish from their descendants."
</blockquote>
</p>

<P>Throughout each <i>yom tov</i> we celebrate the <i>nissim gluyim</i>,
overt and obvious miracles that Hashem performs for <i>Klal Yisroel</i>.
Pesach, Shavuos, and Sukkos are times when the <i>hashgachas</i> Hashem is
undeniably revealed. Indeed, Ben Zoma maintains that <i>l'asid lavo</i> we will
not mention <i>yetsias Mitzrayim</i> in our daily <i>tefillos</i>. The Gemara (<i>Berachos
</i>14b) explains that this view is based on the <i>pasuk</i> in Yirmiyahu
(27:7-8):

<Blockquote><i>"Hiney yamim boim neum Hashem v'lo yomru od chai Hashem asher
he'ela es Bnai Yisroel mei'Eretz Mitzrayim, ki im chai Hashem asher he'ela v'asher
heivi es zerah Beis Yisroel mei'Eretz Tzafona u'mikol ha'aratzos asher hidachtim
shom"</i> - Behold days are coming, the word of Hashem, when people will no
longer swear, as Hashem lives, who brought <i>Bnai Yisroel</i> up from the land
of <i>Mitzrayim</i>, but rather, as Hashem lives, who brought up and brought
back the offspring of <i>Bnai Yisroel</i> from the land of the North and all
the lands were he had dispersed them.
</blockquote>
</p>

<P>Accordingly the Midrash asserts that when we experience the <i>geulah
asidah bimeheira biyameinu</i> we will no longer commemorate our <i>yomim tovim</i>
in the same way, but rather we will celebrate the miracle of our current
redemption.</p>

<P>Purim, however, teaches us a different lesson. Unlike other <i>yomim
tovim</i>, during which we celebrate <i>nissim gluyim</i>, Purim, the Gra
explains, teaches us to recognize and appreciate the <i>yad</i> Hashem in times
of <i>hester panim.</i> Even in the darkness of <i>galus</i>, one finds and
experiences <i>hasra'as hashechinah</i>. This lesson endures forever - "v'zichram
lo yasuf mizaram (Esther, 9:28)".</p>

<P>Indeed the Ramban so magnificently explains:

<Blockquote><i>"Umin hanissim hagedolim hamefursamim adam modeh bnissim hanistarim
sheheim yesod haTorah kulah. She'ein laadam cheilek b'Toras Moshe rabbeinu ad shena'amin
bechol devarienu u'mikreinu shekulam nissim ein bohem tevah uminhago shel olam,
bein b'Ravm, bein b'yachid"</i> - through the great open miracles one comes
to admit the hidden miracles which constitute the foundation of the whole
Torah. For no one can have a part in the Torah of Moshe Rabbeinu unless he
believes that all our words and our events are miraculous in scope, there being
no natural or customary way of the world, whether affecting the public or the
individual"</blockquote>
</p>

<P><i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i> at times performs <i>nissim gluyim</i>
to hone our vision to recognize and appreciate <i>nissim nistarim</i>.</p>

<P>The gemara (<i>Megillah</i> 6b) asks why does Rabban Shimon ben
Gamliel insist that we celebrate Purim during <i>Adar Sheini</i>? The gemara
answers, "<i>amar Rav Tevi, ta'ama d'Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel mismach geulah
l'geulah adif</i> - it is preferable to link the redemption of Purim with the
redemption of Pesach. The connection between Pesach and Purim, between the <i>nissim
gluyim</i> and <i>nissim nistarim</i>, underscores the infinite <i>nissim</i>
and <i>chassadim</i> that <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i> bestows on each one of us.
May we be <i>zoche</i> to recognize and appreciate "<i>nissecha sheb'chol yom imanu</i>."</p>

<P>What's in a name? The Torah (<i>Shemos</i> 16:36) tells is that an <i>omer</i> is a tenth of an <i>ephah</i> (a dry measure). Rashi
on this verse makes a calculation and informs us that a tenth of an <i>ephah</i>
is the minimum amount of dough needed for the requirements of taking <i>challah</i>
and for the <i>menachos</i>. What is of special noteworthiness is that the
Torah and the Ravs take note of this weight measurement of <i>omer</i> and refer
both to the <i>korban</i> of barley that is brought on the second day of Pesach
(the sixteenth of Nissan) not as the offering of barley but as the <i>korban omer</i>
(<i>Vayikra</i> 23:10, 11, 12). Moreover, the mitzvah of counting and
connecting the <i>yom tov</i> of Pesach with that of Shavuos is called counting
the <i>omer</i> (Sefer HaChinuch, mitzvah 306). Why stress the <i>omer</i> in
each case, when even regarding the <i>korban tamid</i>, brought twice daily,
the Torah ordains (<i>Bamidbar</i> 28:5) that it be accompanied by a tenth <i>ephah</i>
of fine flour as a meal offering, with no mention of the <i>omer</i>?</p>



<P>Rav Yosef Salant <i>zt"l</i> in his Be'er Yosef suggests a
fascinating answer. He notes that the first time the term <i>omer</i> is used
in the Torah is in conjunction with the <i>mann</i> that miraculously sustained
the Jewish nation in the desert for forty years. Moshe directs them to (<i>Shemos</i>
 16:16) "gather from it an <i>omer</i> per person." Moreover, when Moshe is
told to hide and preserve some <i>mann</i> so that future generations will be
able to actually witness the miracle food, he places an <i>omer's</i> worth of <i>mann</i>
for safekeeping in the <i>aron</i> (<i>Yuma</i> 52b). The <i>gemarah</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i>
38a) teaches that the <i>mann</i> stopped falling on the seventh of Adar - the
day of Moshe's death - as the <i>mann</i> fell in his honor. Unlike the other
times that the Torah teaches (<i>Shemos</i> 16:20) that that which was left
overnight became worm infested and putrid, here it lasted until they crossed
the Jordan, until the sixteenth of Nissan. From then on they ate of the produce
of the land.</p>



<P>It is thus no coincidence that the Torah ordained that the <i>korban
omer</i> whose purpose is to thank Hashem for His kindness in renewing the
harvest (and we thus present Him with this produce prior to our benefiting from
it - Sefer HaChinuch mitzvah 306) was to be brought on the day the <i>mann</i>
stopped nourishing us. Thus, the sixteenth of Nissan, the second day of Pesach,
is the day the <i>korban omer</i> was brought.</p>



<P>Our bringing the <i>korban omer</i> results in our remembering
the <i>omer</i> of the <i>mann</i>. As the <i>mann</i> was <i>hamotzi lechem
min hashomayim</i> - the produce of <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> is <i>hamotzi lechem
min haaretz</i>. The <i>motzi</i> is the same. The produce of the Land of Israel
represented by the <i>omer</i> of barley is no less a divine blessing than the <i>omer</i>
of <i>mann</i>.</p>



<P>Rav Menachem Mendel of Rimanov suggests a novel
interpretation to the name <i>mann</i>. When the <i>mann</i> descended the
Jewish nation did not know what it was (<i>Shemos</i> 16:15), referring to the new found object they said to one another "<i>mann hu</i>". Rav Menachem
Mendel learns "<i>mann hu</i>" as referring not only to the object of the <i>mann</i>,
but additionally to the persons who ate the <i>mann</i> as they were constantly
being elevated and spiritually uplifted by this divine nourishment. "<i>Mann hu</i>"
- they didn't recognize each other and the positive transformation it had on
the people.</p>



<P>Our counting the <i>omer</i> from Pesach to Shavuos is
likewise to remind us of the special nourishing food for thought the <i>mann</i>
provided. There is no room for jealousy or envy if one believes their
sustenance is being provided by Hashem. Ben Azzai taught (Yuma 38a) "by your name
shall they call you, and in your place shall the seat you, and from your own
position shall they provide you." Rashi explains that each person's livelihood
(<i>parnasah</i>) is not a gift of others good will, rather it is the
personalized <i>parnasah</i> that Hashem has allotted to him.</p>



<P>We count the <i>omer</i> until Shavuos, out time of
reaccepting the Torah and our commitment towards renewed Torah study, as the <i>omer</i>
itself served in that capacity. The <i>omer</i> of <i>mann</i> that Moshe hid
was removed from its case many hundreds of years later by Yirmiyahu Hanavi. In
response to the excuse of the Jewish people for not studying Torah - that they
needed to earn a livelihood - Yirmiyahu said learn from the <i>omer</i> of <i>mann</i>
-as He sustained them with a minimum effort and exertion so will he provide for
you.</p>


<P>The <i>omer</i> teaches: you make time for Him, He'll make
time for you.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Adar-ation: Gratitude to the Multitude]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Benjamin Yudin]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2005]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: shekalim]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The <i>Mishna</i> at the beginning of <i>Shekalim</i>
teaches: on the first of Adar it was announced that the people should prepare
their <i>shekalim</i> and check their fields for <i>kilayim</i> - forbidden
mixtures; that the <i>Megillah</i> is read on the fifteenth of Adar, and that other
services were provided for the community. We are then taught in the same <i>mishna</i>
that in Adar the <i>beis din</i> attended to all the public needs. Why does the
month of Adar warrant greater attention to servicing the public needs?</p>



<P>The <i>Binyan Shlomo</i> (responsa 55) enlightens us with a
novel approach. The <i>Gemorah Shabbos</i> (33b) relates how R' Shimon Bar Yochai
and his son miraculously hid from the Romans for twelve years. When he finally
emerged, R' Shimon said, "since a miracle was performed on my behalf, I shall
go and contribute something to benefit the community." This, we are taught, he
learned from Yaakov. When Yaakov arrived (<i>Beraishis</i> 33:18) "<i>shaleim</i>
- intact" in terms of his body, wealth, and his Torah, "<i>vayichan es pnai ha'ir</i>
- and he encamped before the city". The Ravs understood that he either
contributed <i>chain</i> - charm, or changed the face of the city. He either
established their own currency, or marketplaces, or bathhouses. In gratitude
for Hashem's protection and salvation he showed his appreciation by assisting
the community.</p>



<P>Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> and R' Shimon show how it behooves an
individual to "pay back" the community upon their personal deliverance. Certainly
in the month of Adar when we commemorate our "deliverance from death to life" (<i>Megillah</i>
14a) we should annually direct this thanksgiving and gratitude to some form of
communal service and enhancement.</p>



<P>The <i>Gemorah Taanis</i> (22a) teaches us that Eliyahu <i>Hanavi</i>
proclaimed that two comedians who cheered up the depressed were destined to go
to <i>olam ha-bah</i>. This is further explained by the Maharsha that just as
the <i>mishna Sanhedrin</i> (46a) relates that Hashem feels the pain and
suffering of the individual that is executed, as one of <u>His</u> children is
suffering, how much more so is He pleased when His children are made happy. It
is thus understandable that enhancing the welfare of the community brings
greater pleasure to Hashem, as "G-d, His Torah, and the people of Israel are inseparable"
(Zohar <i>Acharei Mos</i> 23).</p>



<P>Moreover, the entire miracle of Purim evolves around the <i>t'zibur</i>,
the community of Israel. Haman charges (Esther 3:8) that the Jewish nation is "<i>mefuzar
u'mefurad</i> - scattered and dispersed", lacking unity and concern for one
another, and full of strife. To demonstrate the falsity of his charge, "<i>nikhalu
ha-Yehudim</i> - the Jews organized themselves in their cities" (Esther 9:2).
Again in verses 15 and 18 the theme of the <i>kahal</i> forming one unit is
stressed. The very acceptance of Purim by the Jewish nation is expressed by "<i>v'kibail
ha-Yehudim</i> - the Jews undertook" (Esther 9:23), written in the singular,
explains the Gr"a, to portray their unity.</p>



<P>In addition, the <i>Gemorah</i> <i>Shabbos</i> (88a) teaches
the significance of Purim as a time of reacceptance of the Torah. In contrast
to the coercion present at Sinai, understood by our Ravs - "<i>vayisyatzvu b'sachtis
ha-har</i> - they stood under the mountain" each witnessing <i>gilui Shechinah</i>,
(making it almost impossible to refuse Hashem), here at Purim they experienced <i>hester
panim</i> - concealment of His presence, reflected by the fact that Hashem's
name is not found in the <i>Megillah</i>. As the first acceptance of Torah at
Sinai was accomplished in the spirit of "<i>vayichan</i> - they encamped" (<i>Shemos</i>
19:2) at Sinai "as one man, with one mission", similarly at Purim the
acceptance was "<i>v'kibail</i>" - as one.</p>



<P>In addition, the <i>mitzvah </i>of <i>mishloach manos</i> is
explained by R' Shlomo Alkabetz zt"l (author of <i>l'cha dodi</i>) in his <i>Manos
Halevi</i>, that this <i>mitzvah</i> demonstrates the love and brotherhood
present in the Jewish nation. It therefore follows that we focus on the needs
of the community in this month of national unity.</p>



<P>Perhaps one can further suggest that the response to a
miracle is to benefit the community as taught in <i>Shabbos</i>, as an
individual should ideally attribute the miracle not to his worthiness, but to
the merit of the community. To demonstrate this true humility, he shows his
appreciation to the community by his reciprocation on its behalf. </p>



<P>In light of this new dimension and obligation inherent in the
month of Adar, might I suggest that each individual, in keeping with "<i>b'chal
m'odecha</i>" - serving Hashem with your unique talents and resources,
introspect on how you can best serve the needs of, and help fill the voids in,
your community. Not only the obvious needs, such as <i>bikur cholim</i> and
greater attention to the shut-ins, but also to those needs that might go
unnoticed, such as calling the local Yeshiva and offering to tutor a child for
free.</p>



<P>Finally, Rav Ephraim Wachsman shlit"a delivered the following
inspiring message at the recent <i>siyum hashas</i> in the name of the <i>Tomer
D'vorah</i>: all Israel is one collective soul. Your personal learning of Torah
is not only a personal fulfillment if <i>talmud Torah</i>, but it elevates the
entire community of Israel.</p>

<P>The <i>mishna</i> (<i>Megillah</i> 21a) outlines the number
of individuals called to the Torah throughout the year. Although one cannot
reduce the number of required <i>aliyos</i>, occasionally additional <i>aliyos</i>
are permitted. Rashi explains that additional <i>aliyos</i> unnecessarily
prolong the <i>tefillah</i>, causing undue hardship to those who work. Accordingly,
on <i>Shabbos</i>, <i>Yom Kippur</i>, and <i>yom tov</i>, when <i>melacha</i>
is forbidden, <i>hosafos</i> are permitted.</p>



<P>The Ran, however, maintains that the number of <i>aliyos</i>
reflect the level of the <i>kedushas hayom</i>, the sanctity of the day. To
underscore the heightened sanctity of <i>yom tov</i> above <i>chol hamoed</i>,
the <i>chachamim</i> insist that on <i>yom tov</i> an extra person is called to
the Torah. If one would add <i>aliyos</i> on <i>chol hamoed</i>, it would
appear as though one is inappropriately equating <i>yom tov</i> and <i>chol hamoed</i>.
If so, <i>hosafos</i> would only be allowed on <i>Shabbos</i>, the pinnacle of <i>kedushas
hayom</i>.</p>



<P>Although <i>hosafos</i> are generally permitted on <i>Shabbos</i>,
the <i>mishna</i> (<i>Megillah</i> 31a) teaches, "<i>ein mafsikin b'klalos, ela
echad koreh es kulo</i> - we may not interrupt the reading of the curses,
rather one person is called and reads the entire passage."</p>



<P>The <i>gemara</i> (31a) which limits the teaching to the <i>tochacha</i>
in <i>parshas Bechukosai</i> offers two explanations of this <i>mishna</i>.
According to Rav Chiya <i>bar</i> Gamda <i>amar</i> Rabi Assi our <i>mishna</i>
reflects the <i>passuk</i> (<i>Mishle</i> 3), "<i>mussar Hashem b'ni al timmas</i>
- the admonishment of Hashem, my son, do not disdain," which underscores the
inappropriateness of interrupting <i>mussar</i> Hashem. Reish Lakish, however,
maintains that the <i>mishna</i> is based on the general principle, "<i>ein omrim
beracha al hapuranus</i> - we do not recite a <i>bracha</i> on punishment." If
an <i>aliyah</i> was added in the middle of the <i>tochacha</i>, the new <i>oleh</i>
would be reciting a <i>bracha</i> on a <i>davar ra</i>.</p>



<P>The Taz (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 428) raises an obvious
difficulty. Although the view of Reish Lakish conforms to our common practice
where each <i>oleh</i> recites his own <i>brachos</i>, the custom in the time
of the <i>mishna</i> was that only the first and last <i>oleh</i> recite <i>brachos</i>.
If so, even if we were to add an <i>oleh</i> in the middle of the <i>tochacha</i>,
the new <i>oleh</i> would not recite an additional <i>bracha</i>. How, then,
can Reish Lakish explain the <i>mishna</i> in this way?</p>



<P>The Taz answers that although in the time of the <i>mishna</i>
each <i>oleh</i> relied on the first <i>bracha</i> of the <i>kohein</i> and the
concluding <i>bracha</i> of the <i>acharon</i>, each <i>oleh</i> could recite
his own <i>bracha</i>. Indeed if an individual called to the Torah did not hear
the initial <i>bracha</i>, he would be obligated to recite his own <i>bracha</i>.
Therefore the concern of Reish Lakish is applicable even in earlier times.</p>



<P>The <i>Nachalas</i> Yaakov (<i>peirush</i> to <i>maseches Sofirm</i>,
<i>perek</i> 12) based on the <i>maseches Sofirm</i> and <i>Yerushalmi</i>
suggests a novel answer. Although generally only one set of <i>brachos</i> was
recited for the entire <i>krias haTorah</i>, this was not true regarding the
reading of the <i>tochacha</i>. The <i>gemara</i> (<i>Megillah</i> 31b)
explains that the reading of the <i>berachos u'klalos</i> this Shabbos is a
special enactment of Ezra. "<i>Ezra tikein lahem l'Yisroel she'yehu korin klalos
sheb'toras kohanim kodem atzeres v'sheb'mishna Torah kodem Rosh Hashana</i> - Erza
decreed that we should read the <i>tochacha</i> of <i>Vayikra</i> prior to <i>Shavuos</i>
and the <i>tochacha</i> of <i>Devarim</i> before <i>Rosh Hashana</i>". As an
independent <i>takana</i> of <i>krias haTorah</i> separate <i>brachos</i> were
recited even in the time of the <i>mishna</i>. Therefore Reish Lakish explains
that <i>hosafos</i> are forbidden.</p>



<P>The <i>gemara</i> teaches that we read the <i>tochacha</i>
at this time to emphasize that "<i>Atzeres nami Rosh Hashana he d'tnan u'b'Atzeres
al peiros hailan</i> - <i>Shavuos</i> is also the beginning of the year, for on
<i>Shavuos</i> we are judged concerning the fruit of the trees." May we merit
the <i>bracha</i> of "<i>Abayey v'e'teima Reish Lakish - kdai shetichle hashana
v'kilaloseha</i>" - <i>Shavuos</i> should mark an end to all curse, tragedy and
suffering.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: beshalach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<P>The Even Ezra explains (Shemos 15:35) that the <i>nes </i>of
the <i>mann</i>, which sustained <i>Bnai Yisroel</i> for forty years, was the
greatest of all miracles which they experienced in the <i>midbar</i>. Unlike
all the other <i>nissim</i> which were isolated occurrences, the <i>mann</i>
served as daily testimony affirming Divine providence.</p>



<P>Even today we acknowledge and communicate this <i>nes</i>
each Shabbos. The <i>Gemara</i> (Shabbos 117b) explains that the requirement of
<i>lechem mishna</i>, having two <i>challos</i> at each Shabbos meal, and the
obligation of <i>shalosh seudos</i>, three <i>Shabbos </i>meals, stem from the <i>nes
</i>of the <i>mann</i>. Indeed, Rabbeinu Tam explains that although women are
generally exempt from time bound positive commandments, they are obligated in <i>lechem
mishna</i> and <i>shalosh seudos</i>, based on the principle of <i>af hein hayu
b'oso hanes</i>, they too were included in this miracle.</p>



<P>Interestingly, the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>seudas Shabbos</i>
has two different sources. The Torah teaches "<i>Vayomer Moshe ichloohu hayom ki
Shabbos hayom la'donay hayom lo timtsaoohu ba'sadeh</i> - Eat it today for
today is a Shabbos for Hashem - today you shall not find it in the field" (<i>Shemos</i>
 15:24). The <i>Gemara</i> (Shabbos 117b) explains that the word "<i>hayom</i>",
today, which is found three times in this <i>passuk</i>, alludes to the three <i>Shabbos</i>
meals.</p>



<P>The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 105a), however, brings a
second source for <i>seudas Shabbos</i>. Yeshaya <i>Hanavi</i> emphasizes
(58:17) "<i>v'karasa laShabbos oneg l'kedosh Hashem mechubad</i>" - if you
proclaim the <i>Shabbos</i> a delight, and the holy day of Hashem honored."</p>



<P>These two sources - "<i>ichloohu hayom</i>" and "<i>v'karasa
laShabbos oneg</i>" - emphasize different aspects of <i>seudas Shabbos</i>
highlighted by several <i>halachic </i>differences. "<i>V'karasa laShabbos oneg</i>"
underscores the need to have two meals on <i>Shabbos</i>, one at night and the
other during the day (<i>Pesachim</i> 105a). "<i>Ichloohu hayom</i>", however,
stresses the requirement of an additional third meal. In fact, the <i>MecHaber</i>
(<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> O.C. 529) maintains that whereas the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>oneg</i>
applies even on <i>Yom Tov</i>, "<i>ichloohu hayom</i>" is limited to <i>Shabbos</i>.
Therefore, the <i>mecHaber</i> asserts that on <i>Yom Tov</i> there is no need
for <i>seudas shlishis</i>, an additional third meal.</p>



<P>Furthermore, although <i>oneg</i> requires a complete
festive meal which includes <i>pas</i>, bread, the <i>MecHaber</i> (<i>Shulchan
Aruch</i> O.C. 291) cites several views regarding "<i>ichloohu hayom</i>". Therefore
<i>MecHaber</i> concludes that although one should wash and have <i>challah</i>
at <i>seudas shlishis</i>, if one forgot to recite <i>retse v'hachalitseinu </i>in
<i>Birkas Hamazon</i> at the <i>seudas shlishis</i>he he is not required to
repeat <i>Birkas Hamazon</i>.</p>



<P>The <i>MecHaber</i> further explains that if one was unable
to have a <i>Shabbos</i> meal <i>leil Shabbos</i>, Friday night, he should eat
three meals during the day. This <i>Halacha</i> can be understood in light of
the two sources for <i>seudas Shabbos</i>. One who failed to partake of a <i>seudah</i>
on <i>leil Shabbos</i> missed the opportunity to fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i>  of
<i>oneg <u>balayla</u></i>. He is nevertheless obligated to have a total of
three meals based on the <i>passuk</i> of <i>ichloohu hayom</i>. In such a
case, his first meal on <i>Shabbos</i> morning is rooted in the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>oneg</i>. The next two meals, however, are based on <i>ichloohu hayom</i>.</p>



<P>Accordingly, one can understand the view of <i>Birkei Yosef</i>
who maintains that in this case, when one failed to have a <i>seudah</i> on <i>leil
Shabbos</i> and therefore has three meals during the day, if one failed to
include <i>retse v'hachalitseinu</i> in <i>Birkas Hamazon</i> in the <u>second</u>
meal, he need not repeat the <i>Birkas Hamazon</i>. In this instance, the
second meal is similar to <i>seudas shlishis</i>, whose basis is the <i>passuk</i>
of <i>ichloohu hayom</i>.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<P><i>Parshas Vayera</i> and <i>Chayey</i> Sara contain
exemplary acts of <i>chessed</i> which serve as models for all generations. <i>Parshas
Vayera</i> begins as <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i> appears to Avraham <i>Avinu</i>
who is recuperating from his <i>bris milah</i>, Rav Chama <i>b'rabi</i> Chanina
explains (<i>Sotah</i> 14).</p>



<P>"<i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu bi-ker cholim...af atah ba-ker cholim</i>
- Hashem visited the sick, you too should visit the sick." <i>Parshas Chayey</i>
Sara concludes as <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i> appears to Yitzchak after the death
of Avraham <i>Avinu</i>. Similarly, Rav Chama <i>b'rabi</i> Chanina comments "<i>Hakadosh
Baruch Hu nicheim aveilim...af atah nacheim aveilim</i> - Hashem comforts
mourners, you too should comfort mourners."</p>



<P>The Rambam explains (<i>Hilchos Aveil</i> 14:7) that <i>nichum
aveilim</i> takes precedence over <i>bikur cholim</i>, for whereas through <i>bikur
cholim</i> one services the needs of the living, <i>nichum aveilim</i> is a <i>chessed</i>
for the living and the dead. The Ohr Sameach questions this view based on the <i>Gemara</i>
(<i>Succah</i> 41) which describes the practice of <i>anshei Yerushalayim</i>
who would hold the <i>daled minim</i> throughout <i>Succos</i>: "<i>ho-lach l'vaker
cholim u'l'nachem aveilim, lulavo b'yado</i>". It seems from the order of the <i>Gemara</i>
that the <i>anshei Yerushalayim</i> would first be <i>mevaker cholim</i> and
only later be <i>menachem aveilim</i>. Interestingly, the Rosh cites the
practice of <i>anshei Yerushalayim</i> in the reverse order - first <i>nichum aveilim</i>
followed by <i>bikur cholim</i>. Yet the Rambam himself (<i>Hilchos Lulav</i> 7:24) cites our version of the <i>Gemara</i>. How can we reconcile the Rambam's view with
the <i>minhag</i> of <i>anshei Yerushalayim</i>? The Rambam and the Rosh
disagree regarding the focus of an <i>aveil</i> on <i>yom tov</i>. According to
the Rambam (<i>Aveil</i> 10:7) "<i>ain davar midivrei aveilus noheig b'yom tov</i>
- no aspect of <i>aveilus</i> applies on <i>yom tov</i>." The Rosh however
maintains that principle elements of <i>aveilus</i> are observed even during <i>yom
tov</i>. The <i>mishna</i> (<i>Moed Kattan</i> 27a) which states that the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>nichum aveilim</i> can be fulfilled on <i>yom tov</i> seems, at first
glance, to support the view of the Rosh, for according to the Rambam how can
there be a <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>nichum aveillim</i> if <i>aveilus</i> has not
yet begun! Rav Betzalel Zolte explains that <i>nichum aveilim</i> on <i>yom tov</i>
must be understood based on the duel nature of this <i>mitzvah</i>. Although <i>avielus</i>
only begins at the conclusion of <i>yom tov</i>, the element of <i>nichum aveilim</i>
as <i>chessed im hameis</i> can be expressed even on <i>yom tov</i>. According
to the Rambam, because <i>nichum aveilim</i> on <i>yom tov</i> is only a <i>chessed
im hameis</i>, <i>bikur cholim</i>, which is a <i>chessed im hachai</i>, would
take precedence over <i>nichum aveilim</i> on <i>yom tov</i>. This was the
practice of <i>anshei Yerushalayim</i>. Generally, however, as the Rambam
asserts, <i>nichum aveilim kodem l'bikur cholim</i>.</p>



<P>According to the Rosh, however, private <i>aveilus</i> is
observed even on <i>yom tov</i>, allowing for both elements of <i>nichum aveilim</i>
to be expressed. Thus, even on <i>yom tov</i>, <i>nichum aveilim</i> would
precede <i>bikur cholim</i>, consistent with the Rosh's citation of the <i>minhag</i>
of <i>anshei Yerushalayim</i>.</p>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Yonason Sacks]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2005]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: kitavo]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<P>The mitzvah of <i>bikurim</i> encompasses three distinct
elements: <i>hafrasha</i>- designating one's first fruit, <i>havaah</i>-
bringing these fruits to the Beis Hamikdash, and <i>mikra bikurim</i>-
declaring one's gratitude to Hashem. Although the Rambam treats <i>hafrashah</i>
as a single mitzvah (<i>Sefer HaMitzvos, Aseh</i> 125), he counts <i>mikra bikurim</i>
independently (<i>Aseh</i> 132).</p>



<P>The Ramban cites the mitzvah of <i>bikurim</i> in his
fascinating characterization of <i>birchas</i> <i>hatorah</i>. Based on the <i>Gemara</i>
(<i>Berachos</i> 21b) the Ramban maintains that the daily requirement to recite
<i>birchas hatorah</i> is a <i>mitzvah</i> <i>min haTorah</i>. Accordingly, he
challenges the Rambam who does not include <i>birchas haTorah</i> in the <i>minyan</i>
<i>hamitzvos</i>. The Ramban rejects the notion that <i>birchas hatorah</i> is
included in the broader mitzvah of <i>talmud Torah</i>, for just as <i>mikra bikurim</i>
is listed as a separate mitzvah, so too <i>birchas haTorah</i> should be
counted separately. </p>



<P>If indeed the Rambam acknowledges that the recitation of <i>birchas
haTorah</i> is a Torah obligation (see Mabit, <i>Kiryas Sefer)</i>, one must
distinguish between <i>mikra bikurim</i> and <i>birchas haTorah</i>. Rav Asher
Weiss suggest that although <i>mikra bikurim</i> is recited at the time one
brings his <i>bikurim</i> to the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, it is nevertheless
viewed as an independent mitzvah, i.e., <i>mikra bikurim</i> is not a <i>brachah</i>
on <i>havaas bikurim</i>, but rather an expression of thanks to <i>HKB"H</i>
for all the <i>berachos</i> He has bestowed on us. This transcendent quality of
<i>mikra</i> <i>bikurim</i> is evident in "<i>arami oved avi</i>" when we
recall the very history of our nation. Accordingly, <i>mikra bikurim</i> is
seen independently, not merely as a function of <i>havaah</i>, and is therefore
counted as a separate <i>mitzvah</i>. <i>Birchas haTorah</i> however is a <i>brachah</i>
on the substance and essence of Torah itself - "<i>ki shem Hashem ekra, hovu goddeil
l'Elokeinu</i> - when we declare the name of Hashem we must assign greatness to
Him"<i> </i>(<i>Devarim</i> 32:3). This obligation, the Mabit explains, is not
an independent one but rather part of the broader <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>talmud
Torah</i>.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Perspective on the <i>Omer</i> and <i>Shtei Halechem</i>]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Yonason Sacks]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2005]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: pinchas]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<P>The <i>mishna</i> (<i>Menachos</i> 68b) compares the <i>minchas
haomer</i> which is offered on Pesach to the <i>shtei halechem</i> which is
brought on <i>shavuos</i>.</p>



<P>"<i>Haomer ha-ya matir b'medinah ushtei halechem b'mikdash</i>
- the <i>omer</i> would permit the new grains to be used outside the <i>mikdash</i>,
whereas the <i>shtei halechem</i> allowed these grains to be offered in the <i>mikdash</i>."
Both offerings, as we are taught in <i>parshas Emor</i> (<i>Vayikra</i> 23),
permit the use of the new grain.</p>



<P>Although both <i>menachos</i> are mentioned in <i>parshas Emor</i>,
the Torah in <i>parshas Pinchas</i> distinguishes between the <i>omer</i> and <i>shtei
halechem</i>. <i>Parshas Pinchas</i>, which enumerates the <i>korbanos haregel</i>,
the festival offerings, includes the <i>shtei halechem</i> but omits the <i>omer</i>.
Indeed, in <i>tefillas Mussaf</i> on <i>Shavuos</i> we mention the <i>shtei halechem</i>.
On <i>Pesach</i>, however, we don't include the <i>minchas omer</i> in our <i>shemoneh
esreh</i>.</p>



<P>These distinctions point to a fundamental difference between
the <i>shtei halechem</i> and the <i>omer</i>. Whereas the <i>shtei halechem</i>
are included in the <i>korbanos haregel</i> of <i>Shavuos</i>, the <i>omer</i>,
although offered on the second day of <i>Pesach</i>, is not an inherent part of
the <i>korbanos haregel</i> of <i>Pesach</i>.</p>



<P>This essential difference is indicated in the Rambam as
well. The Rambam (<i>Hil. Klei Hamikdash</i>, chap. 4) describes the division
and rotation of the <i>Kohanim</i> who serve in the <i>beis hamikdash</i>. Each
<i>mishmar</i> would serve for a week and was entitled to various parts of the <i>korbanos</i>.
The <i>korbanos haregel</i>, however, were divided among all the <i>Kohanim</i>.
When the Rambam delineates the <i>korbanos haregel</i>, he includes the <i>shtei
halechem</i> but omits the <i>omer</i>. Although the <i>shtei halechem</i> was
shared by all the <i>Kohanim</i>, the <i>omer</i> was given to the <i>mishmar hakavu'a</i>
- the <i>mishmar</i> of that week.</p>



<P>The difference is also evident from the <i>gemara</i> in <i>Eruchin</i>
which discusses the obligation of reciting <i>Hallel</i> on <i>yom tov</i>. Why
do we recite a complete <i>Hallel</i> on <i>chol hamoed Sukkos</i>, but only a <i>chatzi
Hallel</i> on <i>chol hamoed Pesach</i>? The <i>gemara</i> assumes that on each
day of <i>Sukkos</i> different <i>korbanos</i> were offered, unlike <i>Pesach</i>,
<i>she'ein chalukin b'korbanoseihem</i>. On the second day of <i>Pesach</i> in <i>Eretz
Yisroel</i> only <i>chatzi Hallel</i> is recited despite the fact that the <i>omer</i>
was offered on this day! Apparently, since the <i>omer</i> is not found in <i>parshas
Pinchas</i> and is not counted among the <i>korbanos haregel</i>, only a <i>chatzi
Hallel</i> is said.</p>



<P>Rav Betzalel Zholte explains that this distinction can be
used to resolve a further difficulty in the Rambam. The <i>gemara</i> (<i>Menachos</i>
83b) explains that although ideally the <i>shtei halechem</i> and the <i>omer</i>
are brought from the new grain; if no new grain can be found, grain which grew
during the previous year can be used. Seemingly this statement is applicable to
both the <i>omer</i> and the <i>shtei halechem</i>. The Rambam, however, cites
this <i>halacha</i> only regarding the <i>shtei halechem</i> (<i>Hil. Temidim U'mussafim</i>,
chap. 8) and not earlier (chap. 7) when discussing the <i>omer</i>. Apparently <i>yashan</i>,
last year's crop, can only be used for the <i>shtei halechem</i> and not for
the <i>omer</i>! Rav Zhotle suggests that the need for <i>chadash</i>, new
grain, is rooted in the fact that the <i>omer</i> and <i>shtei halechem</i>
serve to permit the use of the new grain, "<i>Haomer ha-ya matir b'medinah ushtei
halechem b'mikdash"</i>, only <i>chadash</i>, the new grain, can function as a <i>matir</i>.
Accordingly the <i>omer</i>, which served as a <i>matir</i>, can only be
brought from <i>chadash</i>. The <i>shtei halechem</i>, however, function as a <i>matir</i>
as well as <i>korbanos haregel</i>. This second element, <i>korbanos haregel</i>,
allows the <i>shtei halechem</i> to be brought from <i>yashan</i> if no <i>chadash</i>
can be found.</p>

<P>The incident of <i>mai merivah</i> is one of the most
obscure narratives of the Torah. The Ohr Hachaim <i>Hakadosh</i> cites ten
different positions, from Rashi to the Maasei Hashem, as to what the sin of
Moshe was. Rashi (<i>Bamidbar</i> 20:12) explains the sin to have been Moshe's
hitting the rock instead of speaking to it. The Ramban challenges Rashi by
asking, if Moshe was to only speak to the rock, why was he told to take the
staff? Moreover, asks the Netziv (<i>Bamidbar</i> 20), we are not informed as
to what exactly Moshe was to say to the rock.</p>



<P>The Netziv then suggests that <i>mai merivah</i> has to be
viewed from the context as to when it occurred. In his <i>hashlama</i> to the
book of <i>Bamidbar</i> he postulates that the book is one of transition from
the time the Jewish people entered the <i>midbar</i> to the time they are about
to enter <i>Eretz Yisroel</i>. It is a book of transition from a state of <i>l'malah
min hatevah</i> - from <i>mon</i>, <i>be'air</i> and clouds of glory, to a
state of <i>tevah</i>, a natural world of man working the land and dependent
upon rain for his water supply.</p>



<P>It is for this reason explains the Netziv that thirty nine
years prior to <i>mai merivah</i>, at <i>Massah U'merivah</i> (<i>Shemos</i>
17:1-7) Hashem actually instructs Moshe to hit the rock. The <i>mateh</i> -
staff of Moshe - personifies a miraculous existence. We recount at the Pesach <i>seder</i>
the verse from <i>parshas Ki Tavo</i> (26:8) "Hashem took us out of Egypt with
a strong hand ... with signs and with wonders." The <i>haggadah</i> explains -
"<i>os-os, zu hamateh</i> - 'signs' refers to the staff of Moshe". Thus, at the
infancy of the Jewish nation the rapport between Hashem and the former slaves
was supernatural. Now as they are about to enter <i>Eretz Yisroel</i>, Hashem
wants to teach them what the procedure will be in case of a drought. The <i>mishna</i>
(<i>Ta'anis</i> 2:1) teaches that they would bring out the ark to the town
square, and the eldest among would preach ways of inspiration. This was to be
the new method, the new rapport between the nation and Hashem. Moshe, explains
the Netziv, due to his anger, forgot this approach and relied upon the former
proven method of hitting the rock, which is why Moshe believed he had the staff
in the first place, if the new method did not succeed.</p>



<P>The Ohr Hachaim suggests a different approach, citing a <i>medrash</i>
(Yalkut, <i>parshas Chukas</i> #764) which says that Moshe was instructed by Hashem,
"Teach before it one chapter", meaning, learn Torah before the rock, and nature
will respond positively on behalf of Torah. That nature is subservient to
Torah, as is understood by our Chazal - "<i>Breishis</i>" for Israel, who are
called "<i>reishis</i>", did Hashem create heaven and earth. The ideal harmony
between nature and Israel is that nature is to serve Israel's needs. Thus the Ohr
Hachaim explains that the significance of the splitting of the Red Sea was not
so much the actual parting of the waters, but rater the timing of the event. He
notes (<i>Shemos</i> 14:24) that the water split for Rav Pinchas ben Yair (<i>Chulin</i>
7a). He had the merit of Torah, so it is understandable that the water should
divide. However, at <i>Yam Suf</i> they had not yet received the Torah, and
still the water split! This was indeed a miracle!</p>



<P>While much of <i>mai merivah</i> is couched in mystery, one
concept emerges mist clearly. The world was created to sustain the Jewish
people and the study of Torah. Often we marvel at the ability of young <i>kollel</i>
families to make ends meet. The response to that wonderment is that of the Yalkut
- "<i>sha-neh alov perek echad</i>" - one <i>mishna</i>, one <i>daf</i> of <i>gemorrah</i>,
one <i>siman</i> of <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, has positive consequences beyond our
national comprehension.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: lech]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>Rav Akiva in Avos (3:18) teaches, "<i>chaviv adam shenivra
b'tzelem</i> - beloved is man for he was created in G-d's image". Rashi (<i>Braishis</i>
 1:26) understands this to mean <i>l'havin u'l'haskil</i> - to understand and
to gain wisdom. Man's intelligence is a reflection of his being created in G-d's
image, and is the yardstick by which his actions are measured. Does he utilize
the Divine gift of intelligence properly or not? Thus, the generation of the
flood was annihilated as they went against their <i>sechel</i> (intelligence)
with their rampant <i>chamas</i> (robbery). (In contrast, notes Rashi (Braishis
11:9), the <i>dor</i> <i>haflaga</i>, the generation that attempted to build
the tower, was built upon love and friendship.)</p>



<P>The above cited mishna continues, "<i>chavivin Yisroel shenikre'u
banim laMakom</i> - beloved are the people Israel, for they are described as
children of Hashem." The mishna is providing for us a progression. First one
has to be an <i>adam</i> - a mentsch, and only then he can be included among
the <i>banim</i>. The Torah of the <i>banim</i>, i.e. the <i>mitzvos</i>, is
clearly stated beginning in Shemos (chapter 12). What however is <i>toras adam</i>?
This is <i>sefer</i> <i>Braishis</i>, and specifically the personal lives,
examples, and lessons we learn from the <i>avos</i>.</p>



<P>The Gemara (Avodah Zarah 25a) identifies <i>sefer Braishis</i>
as "<i>Sefer Hayashar</i> - the book of the upright", as it describes the lives
of the <i>avos</i> who are called <i>yesharim</i>. In <i>parshas</i> <i>Lech</i><i>
L'cha</i> (13:3) the Torah teaches "<i>vayelech l'masa'av</i>" describing Avraham's
tRavels. On his return trip from <i>Mitzrayim</i>, he stayed in the same
lodgings he had stayed in on his way to Egypt. Rashi says- "<i>Lelamdecha derech
eretz</i>"- Avraham was teaching proper conduct. One should not change his
lodgings when tRaveling the same route, lest it be taken as a sign of
dissatisfaction with the first host, and hence an affront to his dignity. This
is part of <i>toras adam</i>. In addition- who told Avraham to endanger his
life and rescue Lot? The Ramban (Bereishis 19:29) attributes this to Avraham's <i>hakaras
hatov</i>, deep-felt appreciation of Lot's accompanying him. Once again, this
is Avraham using his G-d given gift of intelligence- <i>toras adam.</i></p>



<P><i>Chovos Halevavos</i> teaches that Hashem communicates to us
through <i>sechel</i> (intelligence). It is a holy directive from on High.
Thus, there is a complete chapter (O.C. 170) in Shulchan Aruch dedicated to
standards of propriety in accordance with which a person should conduct himself
during his meal. For example, one may not to eat as a glutton. One should sit
and eat slowly. These are parts of <i>toras adam</i>. It is wrong to ask- where
does it say that one is to conduct himself in accordance with the above? The
answer is <i>chaviv adam</i>- this defines how an <i>adam</i> lives.</p>



<P>The Kotzker Rebbe zt"l noted on the verse, "<i>veanshei kodesh
tiheyu li</i> - people of holiness shall you be to me" (Shmos 22:30), that the Torah first mandates that we be <i>anshei</i>- a person, a <i>mensch</i>,
and the build upon that to become a <i>kadosh</i> (holy).</p>



<P>Too often the <i>kiddush</i> following <i>davening</i> does
not reflect this <i>toras adam</i>. Similarly, the environment and demeanor at
the <i>shmorgassbord</i> too often can bring out the worst in us. <i>Chaviv adam</i>
is a directive to all mankind, and unfortunately too often we neglect it,
substituting pleasure and technology in its stead. Compare photographs of
people 50 years ago to that of this day and one can see the failing of a lack
of <i>toras adam</i>.</p>



<P>Koheles (7:29) teaches, G-d has made man yashar (straight),
but man has sought out many intrigues. Hashem made man a <i>yashar</i> by
endowing him with <i>sechel</i> (intelligence). This is the book of Breishis
and the many lessons of the <i>avos</i> are chapters in <i>yashrus</i>. The too
familiar excuse, "it doesn't say in the Mishna Brurah" or "show me where it
says it's <i>assur</i>", and then concluding that it therefore must be <i>muttar</i>,
is an affront upon <i>toras</i> <i>adam</i>. May we be privileged to actualize
the great potential of <i>tzelem Elokim</i> that Hashem has invested in us.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: shoftim]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The last two of the forty-one <i>mitzvos </i>contained in <i>parshas
Shoftim</i> concern the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>eglah arufah</i>. If the corpse of
a murder victim is found in the Land of Israel, the elders of the city closest
to the corpse participate in a ritual whereby a cow that has not yet reached
its second birthday is brought to a valley whose land is too harsh to have been
worked. The cow is killed by someone axing the back of its neck. The elders
then recite "<i>ya-deinu lo shofchu ha-dam hazeh</i> - our hands have not
spilled this blood" (<i>Devarim</i> 21:7).</p>



<P>The Talmud (<i>Sotah</i> 46b) asks the obvious question: Would
we really suspect that the leaders of the Jewish community actually committed
the murder, such that our suspicion necessitates this declaration? No. Rather,
they declare that they did not allow the murdered individual to leave the
community without provisions and without a <i>l'vaya</i> (an escort). </p>



<P>What is the significance of <i>l'vaya</i>? The Maharal in
his commentary on the above <i>gemara</i> explains that there are two distinct
entities: the individual and the <i>klal</i> (the group). The protection and
Divine providence that a <i>klal</i> experiences is much greater than that
experienced by an individual. Thus, the act of <i>l'vaya</i> transforms the
status of the individual to that of a member of the <i>klal</i>. Hashem notes
this change of status and affords additional protection. It is thus
understandable that R' Yochanan teaches that when one neglects to escort his
guest, it is akin to spilling his blood, as he deprived him of the additional
protection.</p>



<P>The following examples demonstrate the superiority of the <i>klal</i>
over the individual. Firstly, the Talmud (<i>Brachos</i> 8a) teaches that Hashem
does not reject the prayers of the congregation (<i>tefilas ha-tzibur</i>).
Their prayer has a different status than that of the individual. It is for this
reason that we recite a public <i>mi-sheberach</i>on behalf of the sick,
elevating the level of prayer on their behalf to that of communal prayer.
Secondly, the <i>kaparah</i> (atonement) that is attained via the <i>sa-ir hamishtaleach</i>
- the he-goat to Azazel on <i>Yom Hakippurim</i>, did not relate to any
individual members of the nation, but to the <i>klal</i> (the nation as a
whole). It is thus understandable that the sacrifice is affective even without <i>teshuva</i>
(Rambam, <i>Hil. Teshuva</i> 1:2). If an individual brought an offering without
repenting, it is inaffective as "<i>zevach reshaim to'evah</i> - the sacrifice
of a wicked man is an abomination" (Proverbs 21:27). The <i>sa-ir</i> is the
offering of the <i>klal</i>, and it relates to whoever is part of the <i>klal</i>.</p>



<P>The Tur (<i>Orach Chaim 581</i>) notes the unique behavior
of the Jewish nation. Usually one on trial for his life will don black garb, go
unshaven, paying no attention to his personal grooming as the uncertainty of
the outcome looms over him constantly. <i>Klal Yisroel</i>, in sharp contrast,
dons holiday clothes, take haircuts and eat and drink a ­<i>yom tov</i> meal on
their day of judgment, as they know that Hashem will affect a miracle on their
behalf.</p>



<P>The <i>Alter</i> of Kelm explains this Tur in the following
way. Each individual must experience fear and trepidation, and dare not rely
upon a miracle being performed on their behalf. However, the <i>klal</i> can be
assured that the Jewish nation will survive and will reach its ultimate
destiny. Therefore he recommends that each individual, to the best of his
ability, connect himself to the <i>klal</i>. Commensurate with one's
affiliation with the <i>klal</i> will be their assurance and insurance for
their personal success. The manner in which one joins the <i>klal</i> may vary
from teaching Torah to the not-yet learned, participating in public <i>shiurim</i>,
to supporting <i>klal</i> institutions and involvement in <i>klal</i> <i>chessed</i>.</p>



<P>The Maharal's understanding of <i>l'vaya </i>is that the
individual attains the additional merit of the <i>klal</i>, thereby affording
him greater protection. Perhaps, one can say that in addition the individual
becomes part of the <i>klal</i> by yielding his stance - showing flexibility
for the benefit of the <i>klal</i>.</p>



<P>This summer with the disengagement of the twenty one
communities of Gush Katif we witnessed an additional understanding of <i>ya-deinu
lo shafchu ha-dam hazeh</i> - our hands did not spill this blood. With tensions
and emotions especially high, the fifty thousand supporters who gathered in Kfar
Maimon demonstrated incredible restraint. Instead of physical confrontation and
violence, they responded to the twenty thousand soldiers and police officers by
singing "<i>chayal-shoter - ani ohaiv oscha</i> - soldier policeman, I love
you." The member families of Gush Katif realized that there was a higher goal
to be attained, by keeping the integrity of the <i>klal</i> even over their
holy rights.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Irony: A Divine Solution]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Benjamin Yudin]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2005]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vaeira]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>While there are no <i>mitzvos</i> of the <i>taryag</i> in <i>Parshas
Va'eira</i>, it does contain many lessons for life. At the end of <i>Shemos</i>
Moshe throws up his hands in frustration, "me'az basi el Paroh, he'ra la'am hazeh"
(5:23), from the time I came to Paroh to speak in your name, things have only
deteriorated. The response is found in the beginning of <i>Va'eira</i>.</p>



<P>Hashem is teaching Moshe and the Nation of Israel that often
what appears to us to be an insurmountable obstacle and problem is itself the
seed and source of the solution and salvation.</p>



<P>The <i>Gemara Shabbos</i> (119a) teaches the famous story of
the great reward that came to the man who honored the Shabbos. There was a wealthy
non-Jew in the neighborhood of "Yosef <i>Mokir Shabbos</i>", Yosef who greatly
honored the Shabbos. Astrologers informed the non-Jew that all his possessions
would eventually pass to Yosef. Fearing their prediction and hoping to foil it,
the wealthy man went and sold all his possessions and bought am extremely
valuable jewel that he placed in his hat. He was convinced he could guard his
wealth at all times by wearing this hat. As the man was passing over a bridge,
a gust of wind cast his hat into the water, where upon a fish came and
swallowed the jewel. Some time later, a fisherman caught the fish and brought
it to market late in the day on Friday, by which time everyone had finished
their purchases for <i>Shabbos</i>. Disappointed, they said, "who will buy this
fish now at this late hour?" The townspeople directed the fishermen to Yosef <i>Mokir
Shabbos</i>, as he was called, for he had the habit of buying any delicacy for <i>shabbos
</i>that came his way. Indeed he bought it! When he cut it open, he found the
jewel inside.</p>



<P>The Dubner <i>Maggid</i>, in his commentary to the <i>Chamesh
Megillos</i>, <i>Kol</i> Yaakov, at the end of <i>Megillas</i> Esther asks, why
was it necessary for the Talmud to give us the background on how the jewel
landed in the fish? If the Talmud simply wanted to teach the reward for
honoring <i>Shabbos</i>, just inform us that he found a jewel in a fish
purchased for <i>Shabbos</i>?</p>



<P>Rather, this famous and popular story has an additional
lesson to be taught. It was the will of Hashem that the wealth of the non-Jew
be transferred to Yosef, and the owner, tipped off by his astrologers, wished
to insure that it would never happen. Therefore Hashem planted the idea of the
jewel, which he purchased immediately, and behold his faulty insurance policy
turned out to be Yosef's prize dividend.</p>



<P>In <i>Parshas Vayeishev</i> when the brothers see Yosef from
a distance they say "<i>v'nireh mah yihiyu chalomosov</i> - then we will see
what will become of his dreams" (<i>Brasihis</i> 37:20). The medrash comments
that Hashem said - you (the brothers) say "<i>v'nireh</i> - let's see", and I
say "<i>v'nireh</i>" - let's see whose way will prevail - Mine or yours? Hashem
had a plan. To bring Yaakov down to <i>Mitzrayim </i>in the most dignified way,
to be united with his beloved Yosef. He sets it all in motion, by planting the
dreams in Yosef, causing hatred among the brothers, Yosef's sale and ultimately
his languishing in jail for twelve years. One could only imagine how happy the
brothers were to be rid of the dreamer and his dreams, and Yosef bemoaning his
sharing them with the brothers. Yet, it was the very dreams that extricated Yosef
from prison, allowing him to rise to a meteoric political career, and to offer ultimate
salvation for the fledgling nation.</p>



<P>In <i>Meggilas Esther</i> we see this principle as well. It
is not in spite of our troubles that our assistance comes, but literally
through the trials and tribulations themselves; it is actually "<i>matzmiach yeshua</i>"
- they have implanted within them seeds of relief. Haman (5:14) immediately erects the gallows for Mordechai, lest when the king Achashverosh gives the royal
decree to hang Mordechai he has a chance to change his mind. This alacrity on Haman's
part proves to be his downfall, when the king gives the irreversible order to
"hang Haman on it" (7:8).</p>



<P>The Dubner <i>Maggid</i> brilliantly explains the <i>medrash</i>
(<i>Shemos Rabbah</i> 23:3) that explains that since Moshe sinned with the word
"<i>az"</i>, as cited in the beginning, he corrects and atones for it by
beginning his song at the <i>Yam-Suf</i> with "<i>az</i>". The <i>Kol</i> Yaakov
says "<i>az yashir Moshe</i>" is understood to mean "then Moshe should have
sung". The intensification of the oppression that caused Moshe to complain
contained the foundation of deliverance, thus it was worthy of song. Moshe just
didn't realize it at that time.</p>



<P>The phenomenon of the solution being an integral part of the
problem is not only evident on a communal and national level, but applies to
each individual as well. The Mishan (<i>Avos</i> 5:26) teaches <i>l'fum tza'ara
</i><i>agra</i> - commensurate with the pain is the gain. The Ramban in his
commentary on this mishna applies the maxim especially to the study of Torah.
Torah which is accompanied by diligent work and self-sacrifice will remain and
endure long after that which is acquired effortlessly.</p>



<P>Perhaps pursuant to the above, Hashem's response to Moshe is
found in the opening verse of <i>Parshas Va'eira</i>. "<i>Vayedaber Elokim el
Moshe vayomer eilav ani Adonay</i>" - What you, Moshe perceived to be "<i>vayedaber"</i>
- a stern expression - has within it "<i>vayomer"</i> - a kinder expression. Moreover,
within the <i>middas hadin</i> - strict judgment - of "<i>Elokim"</i>, is
contained "<i>Adonay</i>" - the attribute of mercy.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Chanukah as a Holiday of Idealism and Maximalism]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Michael Rosensweig]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2006]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: chanukah]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The <i>gemara</i> in <i>Shabbat</i> (21b) responds to the
query "<i>mai Chanukah</i>" (what is the basis and character of Chanukah)
by describing the miracle of the cruise of oil that miraculously burned for
eight days in the aftermath of the <i>Chasmonean</i> victory. The account is
striking for its de-emphasis of the military victory as a motivating force in
the establishment of the holiday. </p>



<P>To be sure, the significance of the military campaign
registers in other accounts (Pesikta Rabbati, Megillat Taanit, in the insertion
of "<i>al ha-nissim</i>" etc.), and even in numerous <i>halachic</i>
references and nuances. Abudraham and Shibboleit ha-Leket even find allusion to
the victory in the very name of Chanukah (<i>hanu be-kaf hei</i>). The Peri Chadash
posits that the first day is celebrated in tribute of the decisive victory
since the oil was sufficient for that day. Indeed, the Netziv argues that one
should focus attention also on the miraculous survival as one recites the <i>beracha</i>
of <i>shehecheyanu</i> on the first night.</p>



<P>Notwithstanding these and other expressions, it is precisely
the first post-revolt event, the effort to rededicate the <i>mizbeach</i>, that
is the primary focal point of Chanukah. The Or Zarua sees the name "Chanukah"
in this reference (see also Rashi <i>Megillah</i> 30b). In any case, it was the
lighting of the menorah that emerged as the central mitzvah and symbol of Chanukah.
&nbsp;</p>



<P>Why should a post-revolt event, even one that was
miraculous, be accorded such centrality, even eclipsing national survival, an
apparently more urgent miracle. Moreover, there were other miraculous
manifestations, recorded in Megillat Taanit, that did not generated equivalent
days of <i>hallel</i> and <i>hodaah</i>. What is singular about the miracle of
the candles?</p>



<P>A celebrated question posed by R. Eliyahu Mizrachi and
discussed extensively by the <i>meforshim</i> further highlights the problem.
Why doesn't the <i>halachic</i> principle that ritual defilement is not
an obstacle to national temple obligations (<i>tumah hutrah betzibbur</i>)
dictate that the menorah could have been kindled with impure oil as well,
rendering the miracle of the cruise of oil completely superfluous? &nbsp;While
many <i>mefarshim</i> conclude that this rule does not apply in this case,
others confirm that the rule does prevail. The Chakham Zvi argues that the
miracle, while not indispensable, was an important projection of Hashem's
special affection for <i>Klal Yisrael</i>. Still, is it conceivable that the
miraculous centerpiece of Chanukah may not have been fully necessary?</p>



<P>We encounter parallel difficulties when we examine the
eight-day period. The Raavad explains that it took this long to return from Tekoa
with the most refined (<i>mehudar</i>) oil. Thus, the miracle sustained the
higher ambition of lighting the menorah with the most preferred oil, but may not
have been required simply to discharge the Temple obligation of ritually pure
oil! The Beit ha-Levi queries why the menorah was not lit with thinner wicks
during this period to stretch the oil supply. Wouldn't a concession in
the quality of the mitzvah have been justified given the crisis?</p>



<P>It is conceivable that the menorah miracle emerged as the
central feature and symbol of Chanukah precisely because it was not technically
indispensable. As the Levush, Bach, and others note, Chanukah (in contrast to Purim)
celebrates salvation from spiritual extinction. The Chasmonean revolt rejected
the very notion of institutionalized spiritual mediocrity even at the expense
of national survival. The nation could not acquiesce to the decrees against the
study of Torah and performance of <i>mitzvot</i> because such acquiescence
would have undermined the very foundation of Jewish existence, even if it might
temporarily have secured the physical continuity of the nation. The concept of <i>shaat
ha-shemad</i> (Sanhedrin 74a:Rambam, <i>Hil. Yesodei ha-Torah</i> 5:3; Chanukah
3:1) which demands that Jews sacrifice life itself to affirm their Torah
commitment in a time of religious crisis stems from the realization that Jewish
life cannot long survive without the idealism and ambition of a life of <i>mizvot</i>.
Each discrete challenge to <i>halachic</i> life might warrant a response of <i>yaavor
ve-al yeihareg</i> (Sanhedrin 74a- violate rather than be killed) as a
concession to the sanctity of human life. However, when applied pervasively to
justify a comprehensive and systematic breakdown of <i>halachic</i> life, this
policy condemns <i>Klal Yisrael</i> to spiritual oblivion. The principle of <i>shaat
ha-shemad</i> underscores the transcendent value of ideal <i>halachic</i>
standards as worthy of sacrifice. Chanukah, then, represents a struggle for a maximalist
<i>halachic</i> lifestyle. </p>



<P>Precisely because attaining victory in the military struggle
once joined was indispensable, this miracle did not accurately convey the
singular character of Chanukah, although it certainly occasions the <i>hodaah</i>
expressed in al <i>ha-nissim</i>. However, the miracle that resolved the first
national-spiritual challenge in the aftermath of victory, the ritual impurity
of the Temple oil, dramatically captured the very spirit of the Chasmonean
struggle. A miracle that obviated the need to rely upon the <i>bedieved halachic</i>
response of <i>tumah hutrah betzibbur</i>, or even the thinning of the wicks or
use of <i>halachically</i> inferior oil forcefully projected <i>halachic</i>
idealism and maximalism as the foundation of the revolt and set a powerful tone
for the new era. Thus, the <i>gemara's</i> question "<i>mai Chanukah</i>"
conveys an effort to capture the essence of the holiday, not merely to record
its history or the details of its observance. The miracle of the <i>neirot</i>,
which enabled the <i>mitzvah</i> to be implemented without compromise,
perfectly encapsulates the motive, goal and impact of Chanukah.</p>



<P>It is entirely appropriate that unique among <i>mitzvot</i>,
the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>neirot</i> Chanukah projects three distinct levels- <i>neir
ish u-beito, mehadrin, mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i>. While the concept of <i>zeh
Keili ve-anveihu</i> establishes a general concept of <i>hiddur mitzvah</i>
(adorning the <i>mitzvah</i>), only in Chanukah do we encounter different
qualitative performances. Moreover, the Shulchan Aruch and Tur almost
exclusively emphasize the more ambitious and idealistic performance of the
mitzvah! &nbsp;According to R. Bechya the term "Chanukah" also
suggests <i>chinuch</i> - an educational program. May we succeed in
internalizing and inculcating maximalism and idealism in <i>halachic</i>
standards and performance thereby fulfilling the aspirations of Chanukah.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>

<P>Unlike the <i>hatoros</i> throughout the year which relate
to the weekly <i>parsha</i>, the <i>haftoros</i> known as <i>sheva d'nechemta</i>
reflect the character of this time of the year. The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Megillah</i>
4a) explains, "Moshe <i>tikein lohem l'Yisroel sheyehu sholaim v'dorshin b'inyano
shel yom</i> - Moshe enacted the practice of inquiring and elaborating on the
theme of the day." The fact that the <i>gemara</i> applies this principle to
Purim demonstrates that this institution is not limited to the <i>yomim tovim</i>,
but extends to other significant periods of the year. Rav Soloveitchik suggests
that it was this <i>takonas</i> Moshe which guided our sages to institute this
special series of <i>haftoros</i>.</p>



<P>Although all seven of the <i>haftoros</i> are taken from <i>sefer
Yeshayahu</i>, surprisingly their order does not follow the sequence of the <i>navi</i>.
The <i>haftorah</i> of <i>Parshas Shoftim</i> for example, is found in <i>perek</i>
51, whereas the <i>haftorah</i> of <i>Parshas Re'eh</i> which is read a week
earlier is taken from <i>perek</i> 54.</p>



<P>Tosafos (<i>Megillah</i> 31b s.v. <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>)
explains "<i>d'derech hanechamos l'hiyos holchos u'm'shubachos yoser</i>" - the
order of these <i>haftoros</i> reflect the unique progression of the quality of
consolation. The <i>Pesikta Rabbasi</i> explains that although the first of the
<i>sheva d'nechemta</i> assures <i>Bnei Yisroel</i> of true consolation, "<i>nachamu
nachamu ami</i> - comfort, comfort, my people", it is not Hashem who consoles <i>Bnei
Yisroel</i> directly, but rather the <i>navi</i> as an emissary of Hashem who
promises consolation.</p>



<P>Then next <i>hatorah</i> which begins "<i>vatomar Tzion azovani
Hashem, v'Hashem shecheichani</i> - and <i>Tzion</i> said Hashem has forsaken
me, Hashem has forgotten me", underscores the refusal of <i>Tzion</i> to accept
an indirect <i>nechama</i>. We yearn for <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i> to console
us directly. The <i>haftorah</i> of <i>Parshas Re'eh</i> reiterates this
feeling of abandonment and despair - "<i>aniyah so-ara lo nuchama</i> -
afflicted storm tossed, unconsoled one."</p>



<P>Ultimately, Hashem Himself consoles us. Hence the <i>haftorah</i>
of <i>Parshas Shoftim</i> begins, "<i>Anochi Anochi hu menachemchem</i> - it is
I, I am He who comforts you."</p>



<P>One of the many lessons of this <i>medrash</i> is the need
for an <i>avel</i> to accept <i>divrei nechama</i>. Indeed, Rav Chaim Soloveitchik
once wrote, "<i>yavo'u divrei tanchumin ka'asher kein hu hamitzvah l'kabeil tanchumim</i>
- may words of consolation come, as it is a mitzvah to accept words of
consolation", emphasizing the mitzvah incumbent upon the <i>avel</i> to accept
the <i>birchas aveilim</i>.</p>



<P>In these extremely difficult and trying times, we yearn for
the fulfillment of the majestic prophecy, "<i>Anochi Anochi hu menachemchem</i>."</p>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>When Rosh Hashanah falls on a Shabbos, we don't blow the <i>shofar</i>.
There are several reasons for this law. I'd like to present three. The Talmud
(Rosh Hashanah 29b) cites the teaching of Rava that we are concerned lest a Jew
somewhere violates the Shabbos by carrying the <i>shofar</i> in a public domain
(<i>r'shus harabim</i>). The Ravs issued a decree that it's better to remain
passive and abstain from the biblical mitzvah of <i>shofar</i>, to protect the
integrity of Shabbos. This <i>halacha</i> speaks volumes about the <i>halachos</i>
of Shabbos in general and specifically the laws of carrying. This is especially
significant for many of us who are blessed with an <i>eruv</i>. We must educate
our children regarding the laws of carrying and their need to inquire of the
existence of an <i>eruv</i> when they go away for Shabbos.</p>



<P>The <i>Meshech Chachma</i> (<i>Vayikra</i> 23:24) provides another reason. He begins by extolling the significance and importance of <i>shofar</i>.
The Talmud (Rosh Hashanah 26a) equates the blowing of the <i>shofar</i> to a
service that is performed in the Holy of Holies in the Temple; not many other <i>mitzvos</i>
are awarded such a distinction. Moreover, our Ravs understand the blowing of
the <i>shofar</i> as an antidote to the harsh charges of the Satan. The <i>shofar</i>,
as a medicine, has the ability to combat the many different strands of virus
hurled against us. Thus, not blowing the <i>shofar</i> is akin to a sick
patient not taking his medicine. Whatever good excuse the patient has does not
compensate for the absence of the medicine.</p>



<P>It is precisely because the <i>shofar</i> is so crucial and
important to the welfare of the Jewish People that we abstain from blowing the <i>shofar</i>
on Shabbos. The Jewish Community is saying to Hashem, "Your Torah and Your Shabbos
is even more important and dear to us than our individual and collective
needs". Similarly, the Talmud (<i>Berachos</i> 6a) teaches that Hashem dons <i>tefillin</i>
as do the Jewish people; our <i>tefillin</i> contain the <i>shema</i> in praise
of Hashem, while his <i>tefillin</i> contain the verse "and who is like Israel,
a unique nation in the land," in praise of Israel. It is our sacrifice of
foregoing the benefits of the <i>shofar</i> on behalf of the benefit of Shabbos
that serves in our stead. Our abstaining from blowing the <i>shofar</i> on Shabbos
is placing Hashem before ourselves.</p>



<P>The <i>Chassam Sofer</i> offers yet another, most
fascinating, reason for not blowing the <i>shofar</i> on Shabbos. He explains
that the nature of Avraham's command to do the <i>akieda</i> was very different
than Yitzchak's. Avraham heard the command directly from Hashem, which is to be
likened to a command in the <i>Torah Sheb'ksav </i>- the Written Torah, which emanated
directly from Hashem. Yitzchak heard the will of Hashem through his father,
which he compares to the <i>Torah Sheb'al Peh</i> - the Oral Law. Avraham was
ready to offer his son based upon G-d's direct instruction, while Yitzchak
demonstrated his willingness to offer his life on behalf of the <i>Torah Sheb'al
Peh</i>.</p>



<P>It is for this reason that Yitzchak's sacrifice was even
greater than that of his father's. Therefore, the Chassam Sofer explains, we
refer in our <i>Mussaf</i> service to this event as the binding of <u>Yitzchak</u>
- "<i>v'akeidas <u>Yitzchak</u> l'zaroh tizkor</i> - and may the merit of the
binding of <u>Yitzchak</u> be remembered on behalf of his progeny" - as opposed
to the binding of Yitzchak by Avraham, as Yitzchak proved himself ready to
sacrifice his life based on the <i>Torah Sheb'al Peh</i>. In this regard, his
sacrifice was greater than his father's. Avraham was convinced that he head
heard G-d speaking to him, but Yitzchak who did not hear it from Hashem demonstrated
his absolute trust and faith in the <i>masorah</i> - the oral tradition.</p>



<P>In addition, the Torah (<i>Breishis</i> 22:6) describes the
journey of father and son as "<i>vayelcho shneihem yachdav</i>". This refers to
the integration and synthesis of the written and oral law.</p>



<P>The Talmud (Rosh Hashanah 16a) provides as a reason for the
blowing of the <i>shofar</i>, "Hashem said 'blow the ram's horn before me so
that I shall recall on your behalf <i>akeidas</i> Yitzchak'". That is, to
recall the sacrifice of Ytitzchak on behalf of <i>Torah Sheb'al Peh</i>.
Therefore when Rosh Hashanah falls on a Shabbos our abstaining from blowing the
<i>shofar</i> based upon <i>Torah Sheb'al Peh</i> is a living implementation of
a teaching of the <i>akeidah</i>. As Yitzchak demonstrated his absolute
allegiance and commitment to the <i>masorah</i>, our refraining from blowing
the <i>shofar</i> on Shabbos is our affirmation of the <i>masorah</i> as well.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[The Rigorous Simplicity of <i>Temimut</i>]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Michael Rosensweig]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2006]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: shoftim]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<P>In <i>parshat Shoftim</i> (<i>Devarim</i> 18:9-13), the
Torah admonishes <i>Klal Yisrael</i> upon entering <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> not to
emulate the excesses and deviancies of the indigenous population.  <i>Klal Yisrael</i>
is specifically proscribed from obscene acts of idolatry ("<i>maavir beno u-bito
ba-aish</i>"), various methods of prognostication ("<i>meonen u-menahesh, chover
chaver, shoel ov ve-yidoni, doresh el he-meitim</i>"), as well as engaging in sorcery
("<i>u-mechashef</i>").   It is noteworthy that the Torah succinctly formulates
the idealistic alternative to this deviant lifestyle by invoking the concept of
<i>temimut</i> (wholeness, integrity, purity and simplicity)- "<i>tamim tihiyeh
im Hashem Elokechah</i>."  </p>



<P>It is striking that the Torah itself does not define or
elaborate the quality of <i>temimut</i> despite its obvious prominence. 
Indeed, this quality characterizes many of our forefathers notwithstanding the
diversity of their characters and personalities.  Noach's righteousness was
depicted by this term ("<i>tamim hayah be-dorotav</i>").  Avraham <i>Avinu</i>,
the father of <i>Am Yisrael</i>, is charged to be a <i>tamim</i> ("<i>hithalech
lefanai ve-heyeh tamim</i>"), and Yaakov, the chosen of the <i>avot</i> whose
name Yisrael is synonymous with the nation, is introduced with the credentials
of "<i>ish tam yoshev ohalim</i>".  The Torah itself is characterized by this
quality of <i>temimut</i> ('<i>Toras Hashem temimah meshivat nefesh</i>"). </p>

<P>As we enter the month of Elul in preparation of the <i>yamim
noraim</i>, we should reexamine this doctrine of <i>temimut</i> that serves as
the foundation of our unique relationship with Hashem and as a primary vehicle
for <i>teshuvah</i> ("<i>meshivat nafesh</i>").  </p>



<P>The significance of <i>temimut</i> is particularly
highlighted by the Ramban's perspective.  While the Rambam (<i>Hil. Avodah Zarah
</i>11:13,16) explains that this imperative rejects the authenticity of sorcery
and other methods of prognostication, the Ramban (<i>Devarim</i> 18:9) insists
that these alternatives are prohibited despite their efficacy.  Thus, for the Rambam
"<i>tamim tihiyeh</i>" factually establishes Divine prophecy (as well as <i>urim
ve-tumim</i>) as the exclusive epistemological source for supernatural
knowledge.  According to the Ramban (<i>Devarim</i> 18:13), however, the obligation of <i>temimut</i> constitutes a singular <i>halachic</i> approach to
life.  Indeed, the Ramban enumerated <i>temimut</i> as an independent <i>mitzvah</i>
(<i>aseh</i> #8).  He also develops the centrality of <i>temimut</i> as an
approach to Hashem in his discussion of the formative covenant between Avraham
and Hashem (<i>Bereishit</i> 17:1).  </p>



<P>The <i>halachic</i> approach of <i>temimut</i> entails
several interrelated components, each of which is indispensable to attaining <i>teshuvah</i>. 
Unkelos emphasizes the need for an absolute (<i>shalem</i>) commitment to <i>yirat</i>
Hashem.  Ibn Ezra (<i>Bereishit</i> 17:1) explains that the imperative of <i>temimut</i>
militates against questioning the value and objective of the <i>mitzvot</i>. 
Accordingly, Rashi (<i>Bereshit</i> 17:1) projects <i>temimut</i> as the basis
of Avraham's ability to withstand the 10 challenges (<i>nisyonot</i>) that were
designed to test the intensity of his faith.  Rashi (<i>Devarim</i> 18:13) also emphasizes the capacity to integrate hardship without second-guessing and with
total equanimity that reflects <i>bitahon</i> (reliance upon Hashem). 
According to Rashi, simple, pure, but profound faith and reliance on Hashem
obviate the need to penetrate the future.  It is sufficient for one suffused in
<i>temimut</i> to respond to Hashem's directives in the present with a sense of
confidence that this normative, pious path will secure an appropriate future.  
</p>



<P>The Ramban delineates various other facets of the <i>temimut</i>
theme that form an ambitious and comprehensive (<i>tamim</i>) approach to <i>halachic</i>
life.  Faith that is both comprehensive and integrated cannot tolerate the
distraction of other forces and methods (as <i>kishuf</i> etc.).  Alternatives
are irrelevant even if they are effective.  Moreover, the relationship between <i>Klal
Yisrael</i> and Hashem, precisely because it is rooted in unconditional simple
faith, is one that transcends the regular canons of natural and even
supernatural law. The direct relationship, which the Ramban expands upon elsewhere
("<i>ki chelek Hashem amo</i>"), allows for Divine intervention that may
contRavene other media.  In any case, it certainly establishes the inadequacy
of channels other than those that are <i>halachically</i> sanctioned, such as
prophecy and <i>urim ve-tumim</i>.  Furthermore, the Ramban asserts that the
approach of "<i>tamim tihiyeh</i>" entails a recognition that there is a
correspondence between human responsibility and Divine providence.  Thus, <i>temimut</i>
is a basis for human accountability and Divine retribution (<i>sechar ve-onesh</i>),
linchpins of <i>avodat</i> Hashem generally, and especially of the process of <i>teshuvah</i>. 
</p>



<P>Undoubtedly, the Torah did not specifically define this
pivotal motif of <i>temimut</i> precisely because it is not so much a specific
quality or even a group of properties, but rather a simple yet profound
approach to <i>halachic</i> life.  Diverse Torah personalities and the wide
range of Torah itself could be characterized by this term without trivializing
or diluting the concept. Rav Soloveitchik once depicted his grandfather (R. Chaim
), father (R. Moshe) and other towering subtle and sophisticated <i>halachic</i>
thinkers as being men of simple, innocent faith. It is critical that we renew
our commitment to the simple yet ambitious foundation of <i>temimut</i> as we
enter the month of <i>teshuvah</i>.  "<i>Yehi libi tamim be-chukechah leman lo aivosh</i>"
(<i>Tehillim</i> 119:80).</p>

<P>The uniqueness of <i>shevet </i>Levi is evident in the way
they were counted. Initially the entire <i>shevet </i>was counted - "<i>kol zechar
miben chodesh vomahlah tifkedaim</i> - every male from one month of age and up
shall you count them" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 3:15). The <i>bnei </i>Levi were counted
according to their age. The family of Gershon, the oldest son, was counted
first, followed by the families of Kehas and Merari.</p>


<P>Subsequently, <i>shevet </i>Levi was counted again. This
time Hashem commanded Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i> "<i>miben shloshim shana vomahlah v'ad
ben chamishim shana, kol ba latzava la'asos melacha b'ohel moed</i> - from
thirty years of age and up, until fifty years of age, everyone who comes to join
the legion to perform work in the Tent of Meeting" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 4:3).
Because <i>beni </i>Levi were counted for the purpose of <i>avodah</i>, ONLY
those who were eligible to serve in the <i>mikdash</i> were counted.</p>


<P>This time, however, the sons of Kehas, the second son of
Levi, were counted first. The <i>Medrash Rabbah</i> comments, "<i>lama hikdim hakasuv
l'Kehas, l'fi sheKehas haya matoanei ha'aron</i> - because the <i>beni</i> Kehas
were granted the privilege of carrying the <i>Aron</i> they were counted first.
The <i>Kli Yakar</i> (<i>Bamidbar</i> 4:22) explains that in order to
demonstrate that "<i>keser Torah hefker lakol, v'hakol zochin eilav</i>" - that
Torah is accessible to everyone, irrespective of one's birthright, the sons of Kehas
(who was NOT the oldest son) were granted this right.</p>

<P>Similarly, the Rambam (<i>Hilchos Shemittah V'yoveil</i>
13:3) emphasizes:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<i>V'lo shevet Levi bilvad ela kol ish
v'ish. Harei zeh niskadesh kodesh kodoshim v'y'hiyeh Hashe, chelko v'nachalaso l'olam
u'l'olmei olamim</i> - Any member of <i>Klal Yisroel</i> who emulates the <i>Leviim</i>
"becomes sanctified as holy of holies and Hashem will be his portion and
heritage forever
</blockquote>


<P>Indeed the <i>passuk </i>in <i>Mishlei</i> (3:15) describes Torah as "<i>yakara hi mipeninim</i> - more precious than pearls." The <i>Kli
Yakar</i> explains that the word <i>peninim</i> has several meanings. <i>Peninim</i>
connotes <i>lifnai ulivnim</i>, a reference to the <i>Kohein Gadol</i> who
enters the <i>Kodesh Hakodoshim</i>. Furthermore, <i>peninim</i> alludes to the
<i>keser malchus</i>, the royal crown which contains pearls and precious
stones. Additionally, <i>peninim</i> refers to the rights of the first born, as
implied by the verse "<i>vezos lifnim b'Yisroel</i>" (Ruth 4:7). These
allusions underscore the primacy and accessibility of Torah.</p>


<P>The Ramban (<i>Shemos</i> 25:10) notes that the commandment
to construct the <i>Aron</i> is written in the plural - "<i>v'assu Aron</i> -
and they shall make an <i>Aron</i>." Everyone was called upon to participate in
creating the <i>Aron</i>. The <i>Medrash </i>explains "<i>yavo'u hakol v'yisasku
baron shyizku laTorah </i>- everyone should come and be involved in the <i>Aron</i>
so they should merit acquiring Torah". May we be worthy of this unique
privilege.</p>

		<date><![CDATA[2006]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: noach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<P>The complex nature of man is
evident in his creation. The <i>Medrash Rabbah</i> (8:11) explains, "<i>Rav
Yehoshua bar Nachmeini beshaim Rav Chanina bar Yitschak v'Rabbanan beshaim
Rav Elazar amri, bara bo arba briyos milema'ala varaba milematan</i>."
In certain ways man resembles an animal, in others, however, he is compared to
an angel. Man eats, drinks, multiplies and excretes like an animal. He stands
erect, speaks, exhibits intelligence, and sees like an angel. The Midrash asks,
"<i>ubeheima aina roeh? Atmeha! Ela ze metsaded</i> - is it true that an
animal does not see? Rather, unlike an animal, man posses peripheral
vision"</p>



<P>This poignant Midrash distinguishes
between the sight of animals and the vision of man. Whereas an animal can only
see that which is directly before it, man is capable of angelic perception,
discernment and perspective. Man's broad visual field and foresightedness
enables and challenges him to emulate the angels.</p>



<P>Rav Soloveitchik linked this midrash
to others which contrast the vision of <i><u>tzadikim</u></i> and <i>reshoim</i>.
The <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> (<i>Parshas Balak</i>, 765) explains, "<i>noach loreshaim
sheyihiyu sumin, she'eineihem m'vi'im maareh laolam, 'vatereh haisha ki tov haeitz
l'maachal...' uksiv, 'vayaar Cham avi Canaan'...aval tzadikim yirru vyismachu,
'vayisa einav vayar vhinei shlosha anashim'...'vayar es hamakom meirachok'</i>
- better that the evil doers should be blind, for their sight brings curse to
the world, 'and the woman saw that the tree was good for eating...' (<i>Braishis</i>
3:6)... 'Cham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness (<i>Braishis</i>
9:22)...however the righteous will see and be glad. 'He lifted his eyes and
saw, and behold three men were standing over him' (<i>Braishis</i> 18:2). 'On
the third day Avraham raised his eyes and saw that place from afar' (<i>Braishis</i>
22:4)."</p>



<P>Cham and Canaan used the gift of
vision to disgrace and shame Noach. Canaan was therefore punished, "<i>arur
Canaan eved laavodim yihiye le'echav</i> - cursed is Canaan, a slave of slaves
shall he be to his brothers" (<i>Braishis</i> 9:25). A slave who is under
constant control of his master has limited vision and aspiration, and awaits a
bleak destiny.</p>



<P>Avraham <i>Avinu</i>, however, lifts
his eyes and searches for opportunities to perform <i>chessed</i>. Even at a
time of <i>nisayon</i>, he is able to perceive <i>Har Hamoriyah</i> from afar.</p>



<P>As descendants of Avraham <i>Avinu</i>,
we must hone our vision <i>liros beTuv Hashem</i>, to see the goodness of Hashem.
Undoubtedly, each of us is capable of such greatness, for we were created with
angelic vision.</p>

<P>Rav Yitzchok Hutner explains that the term <i>hoda'a</i> has
a dual meaning. In addition to thanksgiving, <i>hoda'a</i> is an act of
admission: "<i>Hoda'as ba'al din k'meah eidim dami</i> - a litigant's admission
is equivalent to the testimony of one hundred witnesses." Only when one who
acknowledges that he is not self sufficient, but inherently dependent, can he begin
to appreciate the goodness of others.</p>



<P>We often measure our thankfulness from the perspective of
the one who performs an act of <i>chessed</i> - we ask ourselves, will he
appreciate my gesture of thanks? To what extent did he go out of his way to
help me?</p>



<P><i>Parshas Vaera</i> provides profound insight into proper
thankfulness and appreciation. The <i>Medrash Rabba</i> explains that Moshe <i>Rabbeinu,
</i>who was saved by water and protected by the dust of the land, was unable to
perform the initial <i>makos</i> himself. Yet how do we understand this sense
of <i>hakoras hatov</i>? Surely the water and dust of the land did not go out
of their way to aid Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i>. Inanimate objects do not need and
cannot appreciate our gratitude.</p>



<P>The inability of Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i> to participate in
these <i>makos</i> teaches us that <i>hoda'a</i> and <i>hakoras hatov</i> must
also be viewed from the perspective of the beneficiary; the mere fact that
Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i> benefited from these inanimate objects elicited an
abundant sense of <i>hoda'a</i>.</p>



<P>Accordingly, the <i>gemara </i>(<i>Berachos</i> 58a)
contrasts the <i>oreach tov</i>, the appreciative guest, with the <i>oreach ra</i>,
the ungrateful guest. Whereas the <i>oreach ra</i> minimizes his needs to
express gratitude, claiming, "<i>kol torach she'tarach ba'al habayis ze lo torach
ela bishvil ishto u'banav</i> - all the effort of the host was surely for his
wife and children", the appreciative guest feels, "<i>lo tarach ela bishvili</i>
- all the efforts of the host were exclusively for me."</p>



<P>The Vilna Gaon observes that each of us is a guest in the
world. One could selfishly feel that Hashem creates little exclusively for me.
True <i>hakoras hatov</i> and <i>hoda'a</i>, however, demand that as an <i>oreach
tov</i> we view all <i>chasdei Hashem</i> as though <i>bishvili nivra ha'olam</i>
- the world was created for me.</p>

<P>After years of separation the Torah describes he emotional
reunion of Yosef and Binyamin, "<i>vyapeil al tzavarei binyamin achiv
vayeifk uBinyamin bacha al tzavaRav</i> - then he fell upon his brother
Binaymin's neck and wept, and Binyamin wept upon his neck." The tears
shed by Yosef and Binyamin were not merely tears of joy. The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Megillah</i>
16b) explains that Yosef was crying over the destruction of the first and
second <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> which were located in Binyamin's portion of <i>Eretz
Yisroel</i>, and Binyamin wept over the destruction of <i>Mishkan Shilo</i>
which was found in Yosef's portion. What, however, is the link between this
moment of reconciliation and the future destruction of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>?</p>



<P>The Ramban explains that the very purpose and essence of the
<i>Mishkan</i> and the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> was to capture and preserve the
exalted moment of <i>kabbolas haTorah</i>. Just as <i>maamad Har Sinai</i>
represents a time of intense <i>hashroas haShechina</i>&nbsp;and unity of <i>Klal
Yisroel</i>, so too the&nbsp; <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> embodied these qualities.
Without <i>hashroas haShechina</i> and <i>achdus</i> the&nbsp; <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i> could not exist.</p>



<P>The reconciliation of Yosef and his brothers marks a period
of harmony and unity. Yet Yosef and Binyamin knew through <i>ruach hakodesh</i>
that this ideal condition would not endure. <i>Klal Yisroel</i> would once
again exhibit <i>sinas chinam</i> which would result in the destruction of the <i>&nbsp;Beis
Hamikdash</i>. Accordingly, even at this moment of intense joy, Yosef and
Binyamin cry over the future destruction of the&nbsp; <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>.</p>



<P>The theme of unity and redemption is highlighted in the <i>hatorah</i>.
Yechezkel <i>hanavi</i> who experienced the <i>churban</i> and joins <i>Bnei
Yisroel</i>&nbsp;in Bavel declares, </p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"<i>hinei ani lokeach es eitz Yosef asher beyad
Ephraim vshivte Yisroel chaveiro nosati oasm alav es eitz Yehuda voasisom
le-eitz echad vehayu echad beyodi</i> - behold I take the wooden tablet
of Yosef which is in Ephraim's hand, and one of the Tribes of Israel his
comrades, and shall place them with it together with the wooden tablet of
Yehuda, and I will make one wooden tablet and they shall become one in my
hand" (37:19)</p>

<P>"<i>vehaya mishkani aleihem vehayisi lahem le-Elokim
veheima yeheyu li le-am</i> - My dwelling place shall be upon them and I
shall be for a God unto them, and they shall be unto me for a people"
(37:27).</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>A poignant illusion to this reconciliation can be found in
the majestic prophecy of <i>Yeshaya Hanavi</i> who describes messianic times,
"<i>vesamti kadkod shimshotayich veshaarecha leavni ekdach</i> - I
shall make your windows of rubies and your gates of garnets" (54:12). The
<i>Gemara</i> (<i>Bava Basra</i> 75a) explains:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>" '<i>vesamti kadkod shimshotayich', amar Rav Shmuel
Bar Nachmeini, pleegee trei malachai borokia Gavriel uMichoel, veamri lei trei
amorai bemaaRava uman inun? Yehuda veChizkiya bnei R' Chiya, chad amar shoham
vecahd amar yashfei. Amar lehu Hakadosh Baruch Hu lehavi kedien ukedein</i>
- 'I will make your windows of adkod stone.Rav Shmuel bar Nachmeini said,
two angels in heaven disputed the meaning of kadkod, Gavriel and Michoel, and
some say two Amoriam in the west, and who are they, Yehuda and Chizkiya, the
sons of R' Chiya. One of them says it is <i>shoham</i> and the other says
Jasper. The Holy One Blessed is He said to them let it be both opinions"</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>What is the significance of the stones <i>shoham</i>&nbsp;and
<i>yashfei</i> which would be used to build the walls of Yerushalayim? The <i>choshen</i>
of the <i>kohein gadol</i> contained tweleve stones which represented the
twelve tribes of Israel.&nbsp; <i>Shoham</i>&nbsp;and <i>yashfei</i> were the
stones which represented Yosef and Binyamin. Perhaps the choice of these
stones, " <i>lehavi kedien ukedein</i>", reflects the harmonious
reunion of Yosef and his brothers, a prerequisite for the building of the <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i>.</p>



<P>May we merit the fulfillment of this glorious prophecy <i>bemeheira
beyameinu</i>.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[<I>Shevuas Haeidus</i> - The Oath of Testimony]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Yonason Sacks]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2006]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vayikra]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[




<P><i>Parshas Vayikra</i> describes the different types of
oaths - <i>shevuas bitui</i> - an oath of utterance, and <i>shevuas haeidus</i>
- an oath of testimony. A <i>shevuas bitui</i> can refer to the past or the
future. Whereas a <i>shevuas bitui l'habah</i> (an oath of utterance referring
to the future) obligates an individual to engage in or refrain from a given
activity, a <i>shevuas bitui l'sehavar</i> affirms or denies what has already
occurred. A <i>shevuas haeidus</i> allows a litigant to insist that an
individual either testify or assert through an oath that he is unaware of any
relevant testimony. Should that individual swear falsely, he must offer a <i>Korban
Oleh V'yored</i>.</p>



<P>Unlike a <i>shevuas bitui</i> which an individual initiates
himself, a <i>shevuas haeidus</i> can be imposed by others. A litigant can
approach a potential witness and adjure him to affirm his denial of testimony (<i>mushba
mipi acheirim</i>). This might stem from the Torah's insistence that a witness
testify - <i>im lo yagid v'nasa avono</i>.</p>



<P>The Netziv (<i>Breishis</i> 24:3, see <i>Harchev Davar</i>)
explains that the right to impose a <i>shavua</i> can be broadened beyond the
example of <i>shevuas haeidus</i>. When Avraham <i>Avinu</i> instructs his
servant Eliezer to find a suitable wife for Yitzchok, the term "<i>v'ashbiacha</i>"
is used, implying that Avraham <i>Avinu</i> imposed a <i>shavuah</i>. The Netziv
explains that because a servant must obey his master, an oath can be imposed.
Similarly Shlomo <i>Hamelech</i> confronted Shimmy stating (<i>Melachim </i>I:2:44) "<i>halo hishbaticha b'Hashem</i>" indicating that a king can impose an oath on his
subjects. Furthermore, the Netziv suggests that the <i>Sanhedrin</i> has the
right to impose a <i>shavuah</i>. Accordingly the <i>Sanhedrin</i> would impose
an oath, <i>mushba mipi acheirim</i>, on the <i>kohein gadol</i> prior to Yom
Kippur to ensure that the <i>avodah</i> would be performed properly. All of
these examples are rooted in the model of <i>shevuas haeidus</i>, where the
concept of <i>mushba mipi acheirim</i> originates.</p>



<P>At times, one who takes an oath must invoke Hashem's name. Rabbeinu
Tam maintains (Ran <i>Nedarim</i> 2a) that this is only necessary in cases
where an oath is imposed - <i>mushba mipi acheirim</i>. We mention Hashem's
name as if to state: by virtue of the authority granted by the Torah I hereby
impose this oath. The Netziv observes that in each of the above cases the name
of Hashem is used in the <i>passuk</i>, supporting the distinction of Rabbeinu
Tam.</p>

<P>Rashi begins his commentary on <i>Parshas Behar</i> with the
famous question of "<i>mah inyan shemitah eitzel Har Sinai</i>?" His question
remains unanswered when we informs us that it comes to teach that as the laws
of <i>Shmitah</i> were given at Sinai with all it nuances and intricacies,
similarly all of the particulars of all the <i>mitzvos</i> were given at Sinai.
The question remains; could not any other <i>mitzvah</i> have served in this
capacity, teaching that all its parts were taught at Sinai?</p>



<P>Rav Yosef Salant <i>zt"l</i> in his Be'er Yosef suggests a
fascinating answer. As the Yerushalmi notes (relating to (<i>Shemos</i> 6:13) "<i>vayetzaveim el Bnei Yisroel</i>") regarding Hashem's telling Moshe to give <i>Bnei
Yisroel</i> the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>shiluach avadim</i> (to free their slaves
they would have in the future), that it is so difficult for a master to free a
salve. It was only that they were in <i>Mitzrayim</i>, feeling the plight of
slavery, that they could accept upon themselves this <i>mitzvah</i> at that
time. Similarly, <i>Behar Sinai</i>, refers to the very special environment the
preceded <i>Matan Torah</i>. The <i>Gemarah </i>(<i>Shabbos</i> 146a) teaches
that when the Satan beguiled Chava to eat of the forbidden fruit in <i>Gan Eden</i>,
he injected in her a <i>zuhamah</i> - an impurity, which among other things
manifested itself in doubt, specifically doubting the oneness of Hashem and the
complete authenticity of his Torah. This <i>zuhamah</i> was purged and expunged
from them during the six day encampment at Sinai (from <i>Rosh Chodesh Sivan</i>
to the 6<sup>th</sup> of <i>Sivan</i>). Thus the special introduction of <i>Shmitah</i>
beign given at <i>Har Sinai</i> is to be understood as follows. The <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>Shmitah</i> is an incredibly difficult <i>mitzvah </i>(see Vayikra Rabbah,
beginning of <i>Parshas Vayikra</i>). To relinquish ownership of your land, to
remove the "No Trespassing" sign, could only happen at Sinai, after being
purged from the <i>zuhamah</i>.</p>



<P>The <i>Chinuch</i> (<i>Mitzvah</i> 84) writes that the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>Shmitah</i>, in addition to serving as a reminder to the Jewish nation
that Hashem created the world in six days and rested on the seventh (and hence
we work six units and rest on the seventh, both in the realm of days and
years), gives us an additional opportunity to emulate Hashem (<i>v'halachta b'drachav</i>-
<i>Devorim</i> 28:9). Just as Hashem bestows in His generosity blessings upon
man and does not ask anything in return for Himself<a href="#_edn1"
name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>,
the mitzvah of <i>Shmitah</i> trains the Jew to be altruistic, to open his
field to all, rich and poor alike, without any strings attached or immediate
benefit for the farmer.</p>



<P>Similarly, in <i>Parhas Behar</i> (<i>Vayikra</i> 25:36) the
Torah says "do not take from him interest and increase; you shall fear your G-d
and let your brother live with you." At first glance it is most difficult to
understand why it is forbidden to take interest on a loan. To begin with, the
lender will charge less interest than the bank. In addition, the borrower is
only too happy to pay. Thus, just as one can forgo and cancel a debt owed to
him, wherein lies the sin if the borrower is willing and happy to pay interest?
The answer, explains Rav Chaim Shmuelevitz <i>zt"l</i> is that we are not
dealing with a <i>mitzvah bein adam lachaveiro</i> (an interpersonal <i>mitzvah</i>),
butrather <i>bein adam laMakom</i> (between man and G-d). if the lender charges
interest, he is benefiting from the plight and circumstances of his neighbor in
need. He is personally gaining, literally, at the expense of another. Note that
prior to <i>mattan Torah </i>we would have called lending on interest a <i>chesed</i>.
Independent of what you take for yourself, you have helped the next one.
However, <i>Behar Sinai</i> we are taught a higher level of giving, one of <i>n'divus</i>,
i.e. emulating Hashem by assisting without any personal benefit whatsoever.</p>



<P>Case in point: a neighbor assists another in a fashion that
is clear to all. It involved time, effort, and money. After the kindness was
performed, the recipient did not even say "Thank you" for the neighbor's help.
The neighbor, the practitioner of the kindness, is appalled - "imagine, he did
not even say 'thank you'!" An honest evaluation is to take place. If the good
neighbor is troubled by the flaw in the recipient's character, that is
understandable and acceptable. If, however, on a personal note he is slighted,
hurt, and offended, then this can serve as the barometer as to the true measure
and degree of altruism in his <i>chesed</i>. If the lack of appreciation on the
part of the recipient disturbs the neighbor personally, it reveals a lack of
total altruism in his service. He has yet to achieve, and must further aspire
to, <i>v'halachta b'drachav</i>, emulating the ways of Hashem, which includes assisting
without any strings attached.</p>



<P>This ennobling character trait of altruism is not only
taught by specific <i>mitzvos</i>, such as <i>shmitah </i>and the prohibition
or <i>ribis</i>, in <i>Parshas Behar</i>, but it is also culled from the holy
city of Yerushalayim. It is well known that the Torah imposes a vacation on the
Jewish farmer in the first, second, fourth and fifth years of the <i>shmita </i>cycle.
After giving ten percent of his crop to the Levi, the land owner is to take and
additional ten percent (either of the actual produce or the monetary equivalent
thereof which is then used to purchase food in Yerushalayim), and eat it in Yerushalayim
(<i>Devorim</i> 14:22-27). Tosafos (<i>Bava Basra</i> 21a) writes that the
experience of observing the <i>kohanim</i> officiate in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>
contributed and inspired the visitor to greater spirituality, as is says, "so
that you will learn to fear Hashem, your G-d, all the days" (<i>ibid</i> 23).</p>



<P>In addition, commenting on the verse in Tehillim (48:3)
"fairest of cities, joy of all the Earth" the <i>Medrash Shemos Rabbah</i>(52:5)
understands David's description of Yerushalayim to refer not only to its
physical beauty, but that in accordance with the teaching of Rav Yochanan -
that there was a specific designated location where one did their personal
financial accounting, outside the holy city proper. The balancing of one's
checkbook, as important and practical for one's day to day operations, was of a
personal nature. This was not to be done, ideally, in Yerushalayim. There,
one's focus was to be on <i>K'ir shechubra la yachdav</i> - a city that is
united and unites. A city of total altruism.</p>



<P>May our praying and pining for Yerushalayim further awaken
within us these especially rich unique Jewish traits.</p>


<hr align=left size=1 width="33%">

<p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a>
The many <i>mitzvos</i> He asks us to observe using our resources are all for
our good. For example, in the merit of giving a tenth of our produce we become
wealthy, as <i>Chazal</i> explain the <i>possuk</i> "<i>aser t'aser</i>" -
giving a tenth of our produce ("<i>aser</i>") so that you will become wealthy "<i>t'aser</i>").</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: kisisa]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>There is a most intriguing <i>medrash</i> (<i>Shemos</i> <i>Rabbah</i>
41:1) that states, "Rav Shmuel <i>Bar</i> Nachman taught, it was good and
proper for our forefathers to receive the Torah and to declare (Shemos 24:7)
'everything that Hashem has said, we will do and we will listen - <i>na'aseh</i>
<i>v'nishma'</i>. But was it proper for them to say (<i>Shemos</i> 32:4) 'these
are your gods, Israel, who brought you up from the Land of Egypt'!?" The <i>medrash</i>
is asking - how could this happen?</p>



<P>The Bais Halevi suggests that the response of "<i>n'aseh v'nishma</i>
- we will do and we will listen" is not to be understood literally. As every
parent recalls instructing their child, why don't you listen before you do!
Indeed, one cannot act without prior instruction. One cannot keep <i>Shabbos</i>
without studying the laws of <i>Shabbos</i>. Hence included in the <i>na'aseh</i>
is an earlier <i>nishma</i>. What then does <i>na'aseh v'nishma </i>mean? It
means that we shall do and understand. We will do and make very effort to
comprehend why we are so doing. The last Rambam in <i>Hilchos Me'ilah</i>
teaches, "it is fitting for man to attempt to understand the laws of the holy
Torah, to plumb the depths of reason and understanding to the best of one's
ability."</p>



<P>In <i>Parshas Ki Sisa</i> (32:1) the Jewish nation
miscalculated the return of Moshe from <i>Har</i> Sinai, and believed the forty
day stay in the mountain had ended without Moshe returning. The Satan assisted
in the confusion by displaying in the heavens an image of darkness and gloom (<i>Shabbos</i>
89a). The Ramban (<i>Shemos</i> 32:1) and others write that not for a moment
did they look for a replacement of Hashem, but they were looking for a
replacement of Moshe. Their leader had effected <i>hashraas hashechina</i>,
causing Hashem to reside in their midst, and this is what they were looking to
perpetuate, a replacement of Moshe to bring the Divine Presence in their midst.</p>



<P>The Ramban reminds us that at Sinai this enlightened
generation (<i>dor de'ah</i>) encountered the Divine. While it is true that Hashem
is incorporeal, in Yechezkel (1:10) the prophet describes His throne as having
the image of an ox engRaved upon it. Thus, on their own initiative with their
understanding and quest for spirituality they endeavored to construct a calf,
as a refection of His heavenly abode.</p>



<P>Hence the perplexing <i>medrash</i> above, explains the Bais
Halevi. They tried on their own initiative to create a holy cow, only to find
out that they are only human, and cannot create <i>kedusha</i> - sanctity. What
was missing from the golden calf was the divine command. Without the
authorization of Hashem it had no sanctity whatsoever. It is for this reason
that the description of the <i>mishkan</i> in <i>Parshas</i> <i>Pekudei</i>,
which is an atonement for the sin of the golden calf, contains the expression
"as Hashem had commanded Moshe" no less than eighteen times.</p>



<P>Spirituality is not created by the initiative of man.
Perhaps a guitar would make the <i>Shabbos</i> morning service more appealing
to the not-yet affiliated and committed youth. However, the lesson of <i>Parshas
Kisisa</i> is to the contrary.</p>



<P>The <i>gemara</i> (<i>Berachos</i> 10a) teaches that the
prophet Yeshayahu instructs King Chizkiyahu to prepare his last will and
testament. The Torah observant King questions the decree and is told that it is
because he refrained from having children. In his defense Chizkiyahu argued
that he saw with Divine revelation that he would have a child (Menashe) who
would not be upright in nature. Whereupon the prophet castigated the king and
said "Don't be so smart! You have no business concerning yourself with these
hidden matters. Rather, what is incumbent upon you, you are to do!"</p>



<P>Moreover, in <i>Parshas Ki Sisa</i> we are commanded to
observe and safeguard the <i>Shabbos</i>. The Torah (<i>Shemos</i> 31:13) couches
the <i>mitzvah</i> in the plural, "<i>Es shab-s-osay tishmoru</i>". The <i>Ksav
Ha'Hakbala</i> explains that there are two different components of Shabbos. On
one hand "<i>mechal'leha</i>", those who profane it and violate its sanctity by
performing any of those <i>melachos</i>, shall be punished. In addition, there
is the <i>oneg Shabbos</i>, the joy and pleasure of the day. Here, one might
imagine, each individual might suggest and follow their own guidelines, such as
casual wear (shorts and sneakers) after lunch, The Wall Street Journal, or
other forms of rest and relaxation. Therefore the Torah uses the possessive
plural form, "<i>es Shab-so-say</i>", to instruct that man cannot define
neither the <i>melachos</i> nor the <i>oneg</i> of <i>Shabbos</i>, in
accordance with what please him.</p>



<P><i>Na-aseh v'nishma</i> teaches us that after a complete
acceptance of the Divine boundaries of <i>na'aseh</i>, Hashem welcomes our
engagement in <i>nishma</i>.</p>

<P>In <i>Parshas Matos</i>, the tribes of Reuven, Gad, and half
of Menashe approach Moshe with the following proposal, "The land that Hashem
smote before the assembly of Israel, it is a land of livestock, and your
servants have livestock. If we found favor in your eyes, let this land be given
to your servants as a heritage, do not bring us across the Jordan" (<i>Bamidbar</i>
32:4-5).</p>



<P>In responding to Moshe, the two and a half tribes said that
they would build pens for their livestock and cities for their children. Rashi
(32:16) cites the <i>Medrash Tanchuma</i> that Moshe criticized them for having
misplaced priorities, as is evidenced by their placing the livestock before
their children - their children should have taken precedence over their
business ventures. Yet, our Ravs in the <i>Medrash Hagadol</i> teach a
significant positive character trait of the tribe of Reuven. They were
concerned that due to their large quantity of cattle, and perhaps insufficient
grazing land in the Land of Israel, they would come to trespass and steal
pasture lands from others. Rather than violate the biblical prohibition of
theft, they preferred to remain on the other side of the Jordan River.</p>



<P>The Ravs further note (<i>Beraishis Rabba</i> 72:2) that
this great sensitivity towards theft came from the founder of the tribe of
Reuven. In <i>Braishis</i> (30:14) we are taught that Reuven brought <i>dudaim</i>
(mandrakes) to his mother Leah. The <i>Medrash</i> (ibid) notes in praise of
Reuven that he was careful not to take any flowers or grain from private property,
only from that which was open to the public and ownerless. The <i>medrash</i>
continues and cites the <i>passuk</i> (<i>Mishlei</i> 22:6), "Educate the child
in his youth, for even in his years of maturity he will not deviate there from."
The Ravs attribute the sensitivity of <i>bnei</i> Reuven to their ancestor
Reuven. We thus see that a great deal more than DNA is transmitted to our
children and grandchildren. While each person and generation has their own free
will, they are given a greater propensity towards either a virtuous or other
direction from their parents and indeed ancestors.</p>



<P>While this aspect of the value system of <i>Bnei Reuven</i>
was most praiseworthy, a careful analysis of the text, as presented by Sforono,
points to another deficiency on the part of <i>Bnei Reuven</i>. Moshe (32:22)
cites the condition of their acquiring the land in <i>Ever HaYarden</i> that it
will become theirs after they successfully fulfill their mission of helping the
other <i>shevatim</i> conquer the Land of Israel. They say no, and insist "We
shall cross over to the Land of Canaan, and our land shall be ours immediately,
and moreover we will stay not only for the years of conquest but also for the
years of settlement as well" (32:34). Moshe, explains Sforno, (32:28)
reluctantly acquiesces for the sake of peace and harmony.</p>



<P>Rav Shalom Shapera zt"l notes in his Hamaor ShebaTorah that
this exchange between Moshe and <i>Bnei Reuven</i> is a further indication of <i>Bnei
Reuven</i>'s skewed priorities. Their primary concern for their land and
business, even if conducted honestly, is not to supersede their
responsibilities to their children. <i>Bnei Reuven</i> transmitted skewed
priorities to their children, and it is no coincidence that the two and a half
tribes were exiled before the other ten tribes by Sancherev (as found in <i>Divrei
Hayamim</i> I:5): "She weeps bitterly in the night, and her tear is on her
cheek" (Eicha 1:2). The Nesivos in his commentary on Eicha understands this to
mean that the sin of neglect and disdain for <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> which was at
the root of the sin of the <i>meraglim</i> on that very first <i>Tisha B'av</i>
is still present in our midst. As <i>Bnei Reuven</i> favored another land over
the Land of Israel, in order to have an easier more affluent livelihood, too
many families reject <i>aliyah</i> and a higher living standard for fear of a
significant decline in their standard of living.</p>



<P>Often they are consciously or subconsciously emulating <i>Bnei
Reuven </i>by choosing materialism over a better environment for their
children. While it is understandable that the post-war (WWI and WWII)
immigrants to America, who had nothing, wanted a better and easier life for
their children, unfortunately, while they proudly extolled the virtues of <u>this</u>
land, they neglected to incorporate a love for <u>our</u> land.</p>



<P><i>Tisha B'av</i> summons us not only to recollect and mourn
the past, but to reevaluate the values we are currently transmitting to our
children.</p>

<P>The <i>gemara</i> (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 65b) cites the <i>passuk</i>
(<i>Vayikra</i> 22:27), "When an ox or sheep or goat is born", to
teach, "<i>shor ben yomo karui shor</i> - an ox immediately upon
birth is called an ox". <i>Chazal</i> are teaching us that whatever the ox
needs in the way of intelligence and self preservation has been given to it
from birth. This is also the norm regarding the rest of nature. A fish
immediately upon being hatched no longer recognizes its parent. Moreover, it
has the radar to know which fish are friendly and are foe. It is propelled
naked into cold water and survives. Similarly, a bird might need the nurturing
of its mother for a month, but afterwards is completely independent. Without
being taught or shown by others, it knows how to construct a home for itself.
In fact, an experiment was done in which a bird was taken away from its mother
prior to hatching and lo and behold, exactly the same day that the mother flew
southward, so did its young. The cat needs its mother for three months.</p>



<P>How different is man! A young child even of five years, if
left alone might well die, not yet possessing the maturity and know-how of
self-preservation. Why did Hashem make the human being the exception to the
rule? Man too could have been born self-sufficient like the rest of nature!</p>



<P>An answer is that though man is endowed with the greatest
mind, intelligence and potential, he begins the journey of life weak,
defenseless and completely dependent on others. As he is influenced by parents,
teachers and his environment from conception, so he grows and absorb knowledge,
values, and understanding throughout his life. Man enters this world dependent upon
others, and ideally never loses the recognition that there is always much to
learn from others. As he grows from infancy to adolescence to maturity in a
physical manner, so does he grow in his realm of understanding, until he too
not only takes but also gives to others.</p>



<P>This is the norm. Rav Hirsch (<i>Breishis</i> 25:25) and the
Minchas Yehuda, by Rav Yehuda Horowitz <i>zt"l</i> note that the name
given to the first son of Yitzchak and Rivkah is Esav, which comes from "<i>asui</i>"
- an already finished and completely made man. This name was given in
response to the fact that his hair was more fully developed that that of a
newborn, and similarly were his nails. The Targum Yonasan ben Uziel adds to
this list that Esav was born with teeth and developed gums. That Ravs
understand that it is not just his physical demeanor that was unique, but that
this was a portend of his philosophy of life, "I am complete, know it
all, don't need your input and guidance." Indeed, when Esav meets
his brother approximately one hundred years later (<i>Breishis</i> 33:9) he
describes himself as "<i>yesh li Rav</i> - I have plenty". In
sharp contrast is his brother Yaakov, the <i>yosheiv ohalim</i> After being
charged by his parents to go to Lavan's house and marry one of his
cousins, he detours for fourteen years to the yeshiva of Shem and Ever. Yaakov
is constantly growing.</p>



<P>Rabbeinu Bachya in <i>Chovos Halevavos</i> (<i>Shaar Habechina</i>
chapter 5) draws our attention to the wisdom that Hashem displays in every
facet of man's being and development. He notes that even the painful
experience of teething for a baby is to teach us to learn from infants that
there is no gain without pain.</p>



<P>It is interesting to note that while Esav was born
differently, perhaps gifted, it is what he did with this phenomenon that
counts. Moshe too was born differently; "she saw that he was good"
(<i>Shemos</i> 2:2) is understood by <i>Chazal</i> that he was born circumcised
and the home was filled with light. Moshe channeled his Divine gift towards the
service of God and Esav allowed himself to not only be pampered and
self-centered as a result of his differences, but also to rebel against man and
God. In fact, the Ohr Hachayim (<i>Devorim</i> 32:1) notes that Moshe is called
<i>Ish HaElokim</i> because he constantly worked on his character development.
He was not naturally a modest man, but became the most modest man. He is
endowed with the coveted title of <i>Ish HaElokim</i> upon blessing the very
same people that challenged him personally throughout his four decades of
leadership. Both Esav and Moshe had free will.</p>



<P>Interestingly, notes the Maharal, that while all the animals
came forth from the <i>adama</i>, none are called Adam but man. He notes that each
animal remains the same, retaining its characteristics. Similarly, if one
plants wheat or an apple tree, the best one could hope for would be the growth
of wheat or apple trees. Man is different. He comes from <i>adama</i> but is
unlimited in terms of his potential.</p>



<P>The very growth of man is most exciting. By being the
beneficiary of parents' love, teaching, and direction, a child, as is
explained in <i>mitzvah</i> thirty-three of the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, not
only has thanksgiving to his parents, but is able to transfer this positive
appreciation to Hashem.</p>



<P>The navi says that Hashem loves Israel - "<i>ki na'ar
Yisroel voa'haveihu</i>" - because he is a <i>na'ar</i>.
This is understood by Rav Yisroel Salanter to mean that just as a young man, a <i>na'ar</i>,
is always questioning, probing, studying, and growing, so are the Jewish
people. Make time to incorporate more <i>chessed</i> in your life. Make time
for yourself and incorporate more <i>Talmud Torah</i> in your life. This is the
way of Yaakov - a life of growth. Esav who didn't need and had it
all, didn't give or grow. Yaakov who realized how much he received from
others never stopped giving and growing.</p>

<P>"So he (Yaakov) blessed them that day, saying, by you shall Israel
bless saying, may Hashem make you like Ephraim and like Menashe. And he put
Ephraim before Menashe" (Braishis 48:20). Many fathers follow Rashi's understanding
of the above, and on special occasions (Shabbos, <i>yom tov</i>, and <i>erev</i>
Yom Kippur) bless their sons with the formula of Yaakov. Interestingly, the Targum
Yonasan says that this <i>bracha</i> is to be extended to an infant at his <i>bris
milah</i>. What might the connection be between <i>bris milah</i> and Ephraim
and Menashe?</p>



<P>Rav Pinchas Friedman <i>shlit</i>"a of Belz suggests the
following interesting relationship. The Sefer Parashas Drachim (<i>drush</i> 4)
notes that Hashem judges man as he is now at this time, and does not look at
the bad that the individual will do. Yet, in His abundant kindness Hashem does
look to the future to see the good that the individual will do and incorporates
that positively as part of present judgments.</p>



<P>Proof to the above may be found in the <i>medrash</i> (Shemos
Rabbah 3:2) on the <i>possuk</i> (Shemos 3:7) in which Hashem said "<i>ra'oh ra'isi</i>
- I have indeed seen the affliction of my people in Egypt. Commenting on the
double expression "<i>r'oh ra'isi</i>", the <i>medrash</i> cites Iyov (11:11) - "for he knows the men of vanity, he sees the wrongdoer and does not take note." Rashi
understands this <i>possuk</i> to refer to the extraordinary patience of Hashem
who sees evil being perpetrated now, but delays judgment. The <i>medrash</i>
understands the verse to mean that He sees bad in the <u>future</u> but does
not consider it now. Thus you, Moshe, see the Jewish people accepting the Torah
at Sinai, seeing the good in the future, which is their ticket to deliverance.
I (Hashem) additionally see their sinning with the golden calf, but I do not
take that into consideration.</p>



<P>Similarly, continues the <i>medrash</i>, Hashem answered
Hagar and provided a well of water for Yishmael, despite the fact that Yishmael
will cause many of Hashem's children to die of thirst when they will be exiled
after the destruction of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>. When the angels protested
to Hashem's intervention Hashem responded "right now what is he - innocent or
guilty?" They responded that he is innocent. Hashem then stated that He only
judges "<i>ba'asher hu sham</i> - as he is now".</p>



<P>We find that when Yosef brings his sons to Yaakov to be
blessed, Yaakov asks, "who are these?" (Breishis 48:8). It is difficult to
accept that Yaakov didn't recognize his grandsons with whom he had been
learning for seventeen years. The Medrash Tanchuma (6) explains that while he
wished to bless them, the <i>shechina</i> departed from him, because Yerovam
and Achav were destined to come from Ephraim, and Yayhu and his sons from Menashe.
Yosef prayed, and the <i>shechina</i> returned to Yaakov and he blessed them.</p>



<P>When Yosef wants to remove his father's right hand from the
head of Ephraim to that of Menashe, Yaakov protests, "I know my son, I know; he
too will become a people, and he too will become great; however, his younger
brother shall become greater than he, and his offspring's frame will fill the
nations" (48:19). Rashi again cites the Tanchuma which says that Menashe will
be great, as Gideon will come forth from him, through whom Hashem will perform
the miracle of three hundred men destroying the army of Midyan of 135,200.
However, Ephraim will be greater as Yehoshua will come from him, who will
apportion the land and teach Torah to Israel, and the entire world will
acknowledge Hashem when the sun will stand still for Yehoshua.</p>



<P>The Arugas Habosem asks, if Yaakov is basing his blessing on
their future progeny, they both have wicked offspring, and if he is blessing
them based on the present, then Menashe, the <i>bechor</i>, should get
preference? He answers that Yaakov was acting on the principle that the future
good be reckoned with now and the future bad not be noted currently, and
praying that Hashem would emulate his ways! This is "<i>b'cha Yivarech Yisrael</i>."
As his grandsons are being judged upon the future, so to will the Jewish people
always merit to benefit now from what their positive and glorious future has in
store for them.</p>



<P>That Hashem looks to our future may be seen in the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>milah</i>. The Rambam in Moreh Nevuchim understands this <i>mitzvah</i>
as a means of helping the Jew to be moral, assisting him in curtailing his
sexual drive. The Ramban sees the <i>mitzvah</i> in a more positive way, for
the Jews to carry with pride the sign of the covenant between G-d and Israel,
and the seal of the King on his body. Interestingly, be it <i>soor meirah</i>
or <i>assey tov</i>, it does not apply to the eight day old infant, but rather
this <i>mitzvah</i> is unique in that it is performed now for the future. As
the father performs this <i>mitzvah</i> on behalf of his child's future, so
does Hashem look to our future to exonerate us.</p>



<P>With the above principle we may understand the Talmud
(Menachos 43b), "when King David found himself naked in the bathhouse, he felt
melancholy, bereft of <i>mitzvos</i>. When he remembered his <i>milah</i> he
was appeased." On a deeper level, suggests Rav Pinchas Friedman <i>shlit</i>"a,
David entered the bathhouse to immerse and purify himself from sin. He did a <i>cheshbon
hanefesh</i> and found himself without <i>mitzvos</i>. He was depressed, until
he remembered the <i>mitzvah </i>of <i>milah</i>, which signifies that Hashem
looks to the future and sees the good he will yet do, and this encouraged him.</p>



<P>The connection, then, of the Targum Yonasan between Ephraim
and Menashe and <i>milah</i> is: just as <i>milah</i> underscores <u>His</u>
looking into the future regarding His nation, so did Yaakov regarding his
grandsons.</p>



<P>We can thus understand the teaching of Ben Azzai in Avos
(4:3), "do not regard anyone with contempt, for there is no man who does not
have his hour." Allow me to explain it referring to the <u>potential</u> of
each individual.</p>



<P>Finally, the concept of future good has <i>halachic</i>
ramifications as well. The Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 344:1) teaches that one
may exaggerate slightly in a eulogy. The Taz is troubled by this license, and
asks why a slight lie is permissible? His answer is very perceptive. He
postulates that if the <i>niftar</i> performed a <i>mitzvah</i> such as <i>tzedakka</i>
or <i>chessed</i> in a particular way, if a circumstance arose requiring
greater effort and exertion, he would have done it too. Therefore we have the
right to say that it is as if he already did it. We have the right to eulogize
the future the <i>niftar</i> would have had.</p>

<P>
The opening <i>Mishnah</i> in <i>Maseches Megillah</i> relates the various days
upon which the <i>Megillah</i> may be read: "The <i>Megillah</i> is read
on the 11<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 13<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup>, and
15<sup>th</sup> (of Adar), no earlier and no later.
</p>

<P>
Noting that the <i>Megillah</i> itself explicitly specifies only the 14<sup>th</sup>
and 15<sup>th</sup> of Adar as appropriate times for fulfillment of the
mitzvah, the <i>Gemarah</i> (2a) immediately seeks a scriptural source
sanctioning the reading on the 11<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, and 13<sup>th</sup>
of Adar.&nbsp; The <i>Gemarah</i> identifies such a source:&nbsp; in describing
the establishment of the days of Purim, the <i>Megillah</i> uses the plural
construction of the term "<i>bi'zmaneihem</i>" (Esther 9),
denoting a <i>plurality</i> of days - "<i>z'manim harbei tiknu
la'hem</i>."&nbsp; This term thus implies that the <i>Megillah</i>
may be read on days other than the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> of
Adar.&nbsp; The <i>Gemarah</i> notes, though, that the term "<i>bi'zmaneihem</i>"
would seem to denote only <i>two</i> additional days.&nbsp; How, then, do we
derive that the <i>three </i>preceding days may serve for the mitzvah as well?
</p>

<P>
In light of this challenge, the <i>Gemarah</i> reconsiders its analysis.&nbsp;
Indeed, "<i>bi'zmaneihem</i>" teaches us that the 11<sup>th</sup>
and 12<sup>th</sup> of Adar are fit for <i>Megillah</i> reading.&nbsp; What,
then, allows for <i>Megillah</i> reading on the 13<sup>th </sup>?&nbsp; The <i>Gemarah</i>
answers that the fitness of the 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp; is self evident and needs
no source, because "<i>Yud Gimmel Z'man Kehillah LaKol Hi</i>."&nbsp;
That is, the 13<sup>th</sup> day's status as a "<i>Z'man Kehillah
LaKol</i>," a time of assembly for everyone, justifies reading the <i>Megillah</i>.&nbsp;
Rashi (2a, s.v. "<i>Z'man Kehillah LaKol Hi</i>") explains
that the 13<sup>th</sup> marks the day in history on which "everyone
assembled to exact revenge from their enemies."&nbsp; This day thus
warrants <i>Megillah</i> reading because the "central part of the (Purim)
miracle took place" on that that day.
</p>

<p>The Rosh (1:1), however, presents a
very different possibility in the name of Rabbeinu Tam.&nbsp; Rather than
commemorating the when the Jews of old gathered to fight, the 13<sup>th</sup>
of Adar marks the day upon which "everyone gathers for the fast of
Esther" - a time of assembly, not for the Jews of antiquity, but
rather for Jews of the present age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This explanation presents
an obvious question:&nbsp; why does the 13<sup>th</sup> of Adar's status
as <i>Ta'anis Esther</i> necessarily justify the reading of the <i>Megillah</i>?&nbsp;
The <i>Gemarah's</i> inference certainly suggests a conceptual link
between the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> and the observance of <i>Ta'anis
Esther</i>, but what is the nature of this connection?
</p>

<P>
To answer this question, Rav Chaim Ahron Turtzin suggests that one must
understand the character of <i>Ta'anis Esther</i>.&nbsp; While fast days
generally assume a tragic quality in commemorating despondent times of
destruction, ample evidence suggests that, perhaps, <i>Ta'anis Esther</i>
is quite different in this regard.&nbsp; For example, the Ran (<i>Ta'anis</i>
7a in the Rif) cites the Ra'avad who questions the permissibility of our
practice of fasting on the 13<sup>th</sup> of Adar, given that <i>Megillas Ta'anis</i>
expressly forbids the enactment of such a fast, due to Yom Nikanor <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>.&nbsp; The Ra'avad adds that even though the celebrations
delineated in <i>Megillas Ta'anis</i> are not actively observed after the
destruction of the Temple, it is still forbidden to establish a public fast day
on any of the listed days.&nbsp; The Ra'avad justifies our practice by
suggesting that only <i>fasts of suffering</i> are forbidden on days of <i>Megillas
Ta'anis</i>.&nbsp; <i>Ta'anis Esther</i>, however, is not a fast of
suffering, and therefore does not violate the prohibition of <i>Megillas Ta'anis</i>.&nbsp;
Similarly, the <i>She'iltos</i> (<i>Parshas Vayakhel</i>, 67) explains
that although fast days that fall on <i>Shabbos</i> are generally deferred
until <i>after</i> <i>Shabbos</i> ("<i>akdumei pur'anusa lo mikadminan</i>"),
<i>Ta'anis Esther</i> is actually observed <i>early</i> (on the preceding
Thursday) because it is not a tragic fast.&nbsp; These sources suggest that <i>Ta'anis
Esther</i> stands unique from other fast days in being a fast day which is not
colored by sadness.&nbsp; Why is this so?
</p>

<P>
Perhaps one can understand the unique nature of <i>Ta'anis Esther</i> in
light of a brief comment of the Rambam at the very beginning of his <i>Yad HaChazaka</i>.&nbsp;
As the Rambam concludes his "<i>Minyan HaMitzvos HaKatzuv</i>" in
which he lists the 613 commandments, he notes that beyond the 613 biblically
mandated <i>mitzvos</i>, <i>Chazal</i> innovated a multitude of Ravnic
enactments.&nbsp; The Rambam defends the legitimacy of these enactments, namely,
that they do not constitute a violation of the prohibition of "<i>Bal Tosif</i>,"
because <i>Chazal</i> clearly publicized that their enactments are <i>not</i>
written in the Torah itself (see <i>Hilchos Mamrim</i> 2:9).&nbsp; In the
course of this discussion, the Rambam cites an example of a legitimate Ravnic
enactment:&nbsp; reading the <i>Megillah</i> on Purim.&nbsp; The Rambam
explains that <i>Chazal</i> enacted the mitzvah of reading the <i>Megillah</i>
in its time in order to proclaim the praise of Hashem and the salvation which
He orchestrated, and to attest to the fact that <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i>
responds to the prayers of <i>Klal Yisrael</i>.&nbsp; In the face of adversity,
we call out to <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i>, and the salvation of Hashem comes <i>k'heref
ayin</i>, like the blink of an eye.&nbsp; The <i>Megillah</i> is a testament to
the special relationship that connects <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> to <i>HaKadosh
Baruch Hu</i>.&nbsp; The significance of the&nbsp; <i>Megillah</i> is that <i>HaKadosh
Baruch Hu</i> <i>responded </i>to our cries.
</p>

<P>The Rambam thus suggests that the
purpose of reading the <i>Megillah</i> is to accentuate the <i>transition</i> from
fear and despondency to hope and joy; to emphasize that <i>K'nesses Yisrael</i>
can find itself on the brink of disaster, and instantly find salvation.&nbsp;
On Purim, we do not merely celebrate the miracles themselves, but rather, the <i>metamorphosis</i>
from disaster to tranquility.&nbsp; The <i>contrast</i> is what is
critical.
</p>

<P>What emerges from the Rambam's
interpretation is that the fast of <i>Ta'anis Esther</i> constitutes an
intrinsic part of the <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, the publicizing and glorification
of the mitzvah, itself.&nbsp; <i>Ta'anis Esther</i> sets the stage,
allowing us to appreciate the direness of the situation that preceded the
miracle, so that we can fully appreciate the greatness of the salvation.&nbsp;
If so, the suggestion of the Ra'avad and the Sh'iltos that <i>Ta'anis
Esther</i> is not a tragic fast becomes clear.&nbsp; The fast is not tragic,
because it merely serves to compound the eventual <i>simcha</i> and <i>hoda'ah</i>
on Purim itself.&nbsp; Moreover, Rabeinu Tam's understanding of "<i>Z'man
Kehilla La'Kol</i>" becomes lucid as well.&nbsp; Our mandate to
read the <i>Megillah</i> on the 13<sup>th</sup> is obvious, even without a
scriptural source, since <i>Ta'anis Esther</i> does not stand as a day of
sorrow independent of Purim.&nbsp; Rather, <i>Ta'anis Esther</i> is part
and parcel of the <i>pirsumei nisa</i> which the <i>Megillah</i> strives to
achieve.&nbsp; When the Jews of old gathered to fight their enemies, they
gathered for "puranus."&nbsp; When <i>we</i> gather, however, we
gather for <i>pirsumei nisa</i>.
</p>

<hr align=left size=1 width="33%">

<p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a>
<i>Megillas Ta'anis</i> enumerates certain celebrated days
that were observed during the time of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>.&nbsp; These
days were seen almost like minor <i>Yamim Tovim</i>, and prohibited
fasting.&nbsp; <i>Yom Nikanor</i> specifically commemorates the victory of the Chashmonaim
over a Greek chieftain.</p>

<p>In describing the festival of <i>Rosh Hashannah</i>, the Torah employs two very different
epithets. In <i>Parshas Pinchas</i> (<i>Bamidbar</i> 29:1), the day is dubbed a "<i>Yom Teruah</i>" (a day of blowing), while in
<i>Parshas Emor</i> (<i>Vayikra</i> 23:24), it is referred to as a "<i>Zichron Teruah</i>" (a
remembrance of blowing). While the <i>Gemarah</i> (<i>Rosh Hashannah</i> 29b) initially assumes that "<i>Yom Teruah</i>" refers to <i>Rosh
Hashannah</i> that falls on a weekday (hence the active "day" of blowing) and "<i>Zichron
Teruah</i>" refers to <i>Rosh Hashannah</i> that coincides with <i>Shabbos</i> (on which <i>shofar</i>
is not blown; hence the mere "remembrance" of blowing), the <i>Gemarah</i> ultimately
concludes that the disparity of language does not actually teach the abstention
from <i>shofar</i> blowing on the <i>Shabbos</i>. Rather, the cancellation of <i>shofar</i> blowing on <i>Shabbos</i> is a function of a
Ravnic - not Biblical - injunction, enacted out of fear that one might come
to carry a <i>shofar</i> in a <i>reshus haRabim</i>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In coming to this conclusion, however,
the <i>Gemarah</i> makes no mention of what the disparity of language - "<i>Yom Teruah</i>"
versus "<i>Zichron Teruah</i>" - comes to teach us.</p>

<p> To account for this discrepancy, Rav Soloveitchik <i>Zt'l</i> suggested that perhaps the
Torah is highlighting two components of the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>tekiyas shofar</i>. While the action of the <i>mitzvah</i>
(<i>"ma'aseh mitzvah"</i>) is accomplished through merely blowing the <i>shofar</i>
(signified through "<i>Yom Teruah</i>"), the mere action of blowing, by itself, is
insufficient. The ultimate fulfillment and completion of the <i>mitzvah</i> ("<i>kiyum mitzvah</i>") occurs internally,
through an emotional recognition of the <i>shofar</i>'s message (signified through the
internally-focused "<i>Zichron Teruah</i>"). In most <i>mitzvos</i>, the "<i>ma'aseh mitzvah</i>" 
and the "<i>kiyum mitzvah</i>" occur
simultaneously. The very moment one performs the action of eating <i>matzah</i>, for example, one instantly completes
the "<i>kiyum mitzvah</i>" as well. However, with <i>shofar</i>, the action does not represent an end in and of
itself, but rather a means of triggering an emotional response. It is this emotional response, the
"<i>kiyum She'Ba'Lev</i>" epitomized by the notion of "<i>Zichron Teruah</i>," which
constitutes the essence of the <i>mitzvah</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

<p> This distinction, between the action of blowing the <i>shofar</i> and the true fulfillment
of the subsequent emotional recognition, may help explain an apparent
contradiction in the Rambam. In <i>Hilchos Shofar</i>, 2:4, the Rambam rules that if one does not have appropriate
intent ("<i>kavannah</i>"), he does not fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>shofar</i>. In <i>Hilchos Chametz U'Matzah</i>, 6:3, however,
the Rambam appears to give the exact opposite ruling: if one eats <i>matzah</i> under duress, without intent to fulfill
his obligation, he nonetheless fulfills his obligation. The Rambam's understanding of whether
or not <i>mitzvos</i> require intent is thus obfuscated by apparently contradictory
rulings in <i>Hilchos Shofar</i> and <i>Hilchos Chametz U'Matzah</i>. Rav Soloveitchik <i>Zt'l</i>, suggested that
perhaps there is no contradiction whatsoever. A <i>mitzvah's</i> subjection to the general requirement for
"<i>kavannah</i>" is a function of the nature of the particular <i>mitzvah</i>. <i>Mitzvos</i> like <i>matzah</i>, in which the
<i>"ma'aseh mitzvah"</i> and "<i>kiyum mitzvah</i>" are inseparable, do not require
<i>kavannah</i>. Their action speaks for itself. <i>Mitzvos</i> like <i>shofar</i>, however, where the action is not an end in and of itself, but rather a means
towards an internal <i>"kiyum She'Ba'Lev"</i> do require <i>kavannah</i>.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Hence, if one lacks <i>kavannah</i> during
<i>tekiyas shofar</i>, he has not fulfilled his obligation.</p>

<p><i>Shofar</i>'s emphasis on a <i>"kiyum She'Ba'Lev"</i> may also manifest itself in several relevant
<i>halachos</i> which underscore an inextricable link between the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>shofar</i>
and the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>tefillah</i>, the prototypical <i>"Avodah She'Ba'Lev"</i> (service of
the heart)<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>. For example, the<i> Ba'al HaMaor</i> (<i>Rosh
Hashannah</i> 10b <i>b'dapei ha</i>Rif) assumes that the <i>berachos</i> which we recite before the
blowing of <i>shofar</i> are a relatively recent innovation. In the times of the <i>Gemarah</i>, he argues, <i>shofar</i> was not blown
before beginning <i>Mussaf</i>, as is common practice nowadays. The Ba'al HaMaor wonders: if <i>shofar</i> was
only blown during and after the <i>Tefillas Mussaf</i>, when was the <i>Birchas Hamitzvah</i>
(blessing generally recited prior to performing a mitzvah) for <i>shofar</i> blowing recited? He suggests that perhaps,
the very text of <i>Tefillas Mussaf</i> itself, into which <i>shofar</i> blasts were
inserted, served as a <i>Birchas Hamitzvah</i><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>. Apparently, even though <i>Tefillas Mussaf</i>
does not structurally resemble a classic <i>Birchas Hamitzvah</i>, the conceptual
relationship between the <i>kiyum She'Ba'Lev</i> of <i>shofar</i> to the <i>Avodah She'Ba'Lev</i> of
<i>tefillah</i> allows <i>Mussaf</i> to serve as a <i>Birchas Hamitzvah</i>.</p>

<p> This relationship is further highlighted by the <i>Gemarah</i> later in <i>Rosh Hashannah</i>
(26b), which instructs that a <i>shofar</i> should be bent. Rashi, based on the <i>Gemarah</i>, explains that a bent <i>shofar</i>
resembles a person bent in humility and submission during <i>tefillah</i>. Apparently, the <i>shofar</i> fulfills a role
strikingly similar to that of <i>tefillah</i>. Moreover, the <i>Gemarah</i> on 26a develops this relationship in its
discussion of "<i>ain kateigor na'aseh saneigor</i>." A <i>shofar</i> may not come from a cow, because that resembles the
<i>eigel hazahav</i>, a memory which we do not wish to evoke. The <i>Gemarah</i> challenges this ruling, noting that the
evocative problem of "<i>ain kateigor</i>" is seemingly only applicable to "<i>avodos
shebifnim</i>" - services of the highest level of sanctity which take place in the
<i>Kodesh HaKodashim</i> (such as selected parts of the Kohen Gadol's Yom Kippur service). However, <i>shofar</i>, which
is not blown specifically in the <i>Kodesh HaKodashim</i>, should not be included in this restriction. The <i>Gemarah</i>
answers that, since <i>shofar</i> serves as a "<i>Zikaron</i>" (commemoration), it is
"<i>k'lifnim dami</i>" - as though it takes place in the <i>Kodesh HaKodashim</i>, and thus
equally subject to restrictions of "<i>Ain Kateigor</i>&#8230;" Apparently, <i>shofar</i>'s <i>kiyum she'ba'lev</i>
makes it similar to the service of the <i>Kohen Gadol</i> on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, and by extension, to <i>tefillah</i>,
which is directed towards the <i>Kodash HaKodashim</i> as well<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Shofar</i>'s subjection to the possibility of "<i>mitzvah haBa'ah b'averiah</i>" (a <i>mitzvah</i>
fulfilled through a transgression) may also underscore <i>shofar</i>'s special <i>kiyum
she'ba'lev</i>. Based on the Yerushalmi, the Rambam (<i>Shofar</i> 1:3) rules that <i>shofar</i> is not subject to the
problem of <i>mitzvah haba'ah b'aveirah</i>, because an intangible <i>shofar</i> blast cannot
be stolen<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a>. This technical reasoning implies that
theoretically, <i>shofar</i> should be subject to <i>mitzvah HaBa'ah B'Aveirah</i>, and that
its exemption is simply the result of a technical loophole. This implication is telling, however,
since several <i>Rishonim</i><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> opine that not all mitzvos are subject to 
<i>mitzvah haba'ah b'aveirah</i>. <i>Mitzvah haba'ah b'aveirah</i> only
applies to supplicatory mitzvos, mitzvos which come "<i>l'ratzos</i>." If this is the case, apparently one
must assume that <i>shofar</i> too is a <i>mitzvah</i> whose aim is to supplicate and to beg, much like prayer, and would
thus be subject to <i>mitzvah haba'ah b'aveirah</i> if not for a technical solution.</p>

<p>Finally, the Rav Zt'l also pointed to the <i>Gemarah</i> in <i>Rosh Hashannah</i> 34b as a support to
<i>shofar</i>'s essential relationship to <i>tefillah</i>. If an individual has the option to spend <i>Rosh Hashannah</i> in a
city where <i>shofar</i> will be blown but <i>tefillah</i> will not be recited, or in a city
which will recite <i>tefillah</i> but not blow <i>shofar</i>, which is preferable? The <i>Gemarah</i> answers that obviously, the
Biblical <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>shofar</i> would take precedence over the Ravnical <i>mitzvah</i> of
<i>tefillah</i> (the <i>Gemarah</i> concludes that even the mere possibility of <i>shofar</i>
blowing would take precedence over a definite <i>tefillah</i>). The Rav, however, questioned the
<i>Gemarah</i>'s assumption that <i>tefillah</i> is simply a Ravnic <i>mitzvah</i>. After all, numerous sources seem to
suggest that <i>Malchiyos</i>, <i>Shofros</i>, and <i>Zichronos</i> on <i>Rosh Hashannah</i> might actually
be a Biblical commandment as well<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a>. If so, would this <i>Gemarah</i> not prove the
contrary? The Rav suggested that perhaps, <i>Rosh Hashannah</i>'s <i>Mussaf tefillah</i> may indeed be Biblical, but only when
<i>shofar</i> is blown during services. If the <i>tefillah</i> is not accompanied by <i>shofar</i> blowing (as was the case in
this <i>Gemarah</i>), however, then everyone would agree that the <i>tefillah</i> is simply a fulfillment on a Ravnic level.</p>

<hr align=left size=1 width="33%">
    
<P><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>Interestingly, the Talmud Yerushalmi concludes that the abstention from <i>shofar</i>
on <i>Shabbos</i> is indeed a Biblical commandment, derived from the aforementioned verses.<BR>
   
<a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>It should be noted that shofar is not the only <i>mitzvah</i> in which the action of
the <i>mitzvah</i> is separated from the fulfillment of the <i>mitzvah</i>. <i>tefillah</i> (see Rambam <i>tefillah</i> 1:1),
<i>Simchas Yom Tov</i> (see <i>Pesachim</i> 109a), <i>Aveilus</i> / <i>Aninus</i> (see top of <i>Sanhedrin</i>
46b) are all examples of <i>mitzvos</i> which prescribe specific actions which are means towards a desired emotional state.<BR>
    
<a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a>See <i>Kesef Mishnah</i> and <i>Maggid Mishnah</i> on Rambam ibid. This explanation may also be consistent with Rambam's
general understanding of shofar, underscoring the passive listening as opposed to active blowing.<BR>

<a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> See <i>Ta'anis</i> 2a.<BR>

<a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a>See Rosh, beginning of <i>Maseches Berachos</i>, who cites Rav Amram Gaon as saying a
similar idea regarding <i>Keriyas Shema</i> and its berachos.<BR>

<P>The character of <i>Tisha B'av</i>
manifests itself in two distinct ways. Modeled <i>after Yom Kippur, Tisha B'av</i>
is essentially a <i>ta'anis tsibbur</i> (a public fast). The <i>Gemara</i>
in <i>Pesachim</i> (54b) explains: "<i>Ein bein Tisha B'av l'yom
hakippurim ela shezeh sfeiko assur v'ze sfeiko muttar</i>" -
the only difference between <i>Tisha B'av</i> and <i>Yom Kippur</i> is
that whereas situations of doubt are forbidden on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, they are
permitted on <i>Tisha B'av.</i> Accordingly, the <i>chamisha enuyim</i>,
the five afflictions that are forbidden on <i>Yom Kippur</i> are prohibited on <i>Tisha
B'av</i>.</p>

<P><i>Teshuva</i>, essential to <i>Yom Kippur</i>,
is a central theme of the <i>krias haTorah</i> on <i>Tisha B'av. "B'tsar
l'cha u'mtsaucha kol hadevarim ha'eileh b'acharis hayomim,
v'shavta</i> <i>ad Hashem Elokecha v'shomata b'kolo" (Devarim</i>
4) "When you are in distress and all these things have befallen you, at
the end of day, you will return unto Hashem your God and hearken to His
voice."</p>

<P><i>Tisha B'av</i>, however,
is not merely a <i>ta'anis tsibbur</i>. The <i>gemara</i> in <i>Taanis</i>
(30a) teaches, "<i>Kol mitzvos hanohagos b'aveil nohagos b'Tisha
B'av</i>". In addition <i>to ta'anis</i> <i>tsibbur, Tisha B'av</i>
is characterized as a <i>yom aveilus</i> - a day of mourning. This aspect
of the day is emphasized in the <i>haftorah, "asof asifem</i>",
"I shall utterly destroy them," which underscores the despair,
suffering, and <i>aveilus</i> of <i>K'nesses Yisroel</i>.</p>

<P>The <i>Rambam (Peirush Hamishnayos,
Maseches Ta'anis</i>) emphasizes these two aspects of the day. Because <i>Tisha'B'av</i>
is a <i>ta'anis tzibbur</i> we refrain from eating and drinking. We sit
on the floor and refrain from Torah study to mark the fact that <i>Tisha B'av</i>
is a day of mourning.</p>

<P>The <i>Meiri (Yoma</i> 78a) explains that
because of the additional element of <i>aveilu</i>s, Rav <i>Yehoshua Ben Levi</i>
refrained on <i>Tisha B'av</i> from wiping his face, hands and feet with
a towel - a practice that is permitted on <i>Yom Kippur!</i></p>

<P>The <i>Minchas Chinuch</i> (<i>mitzvah</i> 312)
suggests that the <i>issur rechitzah</i>, the prohibition to wash, for example,
links these two elements. Both an <i>avel</i>, as well as someone who observes
a <i>taanis tzibbur</i>, are forbidden to wash. However, whereas <i>aveilus</i>
prohibits one from washing their entire body, <i>taanis tzibbur</i> forbids one
from washing a small part of the body as well.</p>

<P>The <i>Minchas Chinuch</i> further suggests
that when <i>Tisha B'av</i> occurs on <i>Shabbos</i>, although the <i>ta'anis</i>
is observed on Sunday, various aspects of <i>aveilus</i> apply even on <i>Shabbos</i>.</p>

<P>Emphasizing the nature of <i>Tisha B'av</i>
as a day of mourning, the <i>Chassam Sofer (Ohr Hachaim siman</i> 157)
maintains that even individuals who must eat on <i>Tisha B'av</i> can be
called to the Torah and receive an <i>aliyah</i>. He suggests that the
obligation of <i>krias</i> <i>haTorah </i>on <i>Tisha B'Av</i> is not
merely a function of <i>ta'anis tsibbur</i>, but reflects the character
of the day as a <i>yom aveilus</i>.</p>

<P>The <i>Rambam</i> extends another element of <i>Yom
Hakippurim</i> to <i>Tisha B'av</i>. The <i>Gemara (Yoma </i>81b)
explains that one is obligated to begin <i>Yom Hakippurim</i> early, before
sunset. The Torah obligation is determined from, "<i>ve'inisem es nafshoseichem
betisha bachodesh baerev</i>," indication that <i>Yom HaKippurim</i> is
to begin on the ninth of <i>Tishrei</i> towards evening. Most <i>rishonim</i>
maintain that this <i>mitzvah</i> is not limited to <i>Yom Hakippurim</i> but
applies to <i>Shabbos</i> and <i>yom tov</i> as well. The <i>Rambam</i> does
not mention the mitzvah of <i>tosefes Shabbos</i> and <i>yom tov</i> in the <i>Perush
Hamishnayos</i>; however, he does emphasize the need to begin <i>Tisha B'av</i>
early, "<i>umosifin michol oll hakodesh</i>." According to the <i>Rambam</i>,
the mitzvah of <i>tosefes</i> is not a function of <i>kiddush hayom</i>, but
rather of <i>taanis tzibbur.</i></p>

<P>Our commemoration of <i>Tisha Ba'av</i>
uniquely binds these aspects of <i>taanis tzibbur</i> and <i>aveilus</i>. May
our observance be <i>meorer rachamei shomayim</i> as we await <i>biyas Goel Tzedek
bimheira biyameinu.</i></p>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The primary observance of Chanukah is with the recitation of
<i>Hallel</i> and <i>Hoda'ah</i>, and the recitation of <i>Al Hanissim</i>
(<i>Shabbos</i> 21b). In the latter, we recount, "when the wicked Greek
kingdom rose up against Your people Israel <i>l'hashgicham Torasecha</i>
- to make them forget Your Torah and compel them to stray from the
statutes of Your will." How did the enemies of Hashem and Israel attempt
to implement <i>l'hashgicham Torasecha</i>? The Romans knew how to cause Israel
to forget its Torah. The wicked Roman regime decreed that the Jewish people
should not engage in the study of Torah (<i>Berachos</i> 61b). Rav Akiva
defied their edict, convening public assemblies to engage in Torah study. Rav
Akiva was tortured to and executed by the Romans.</p>



<P>The Greeks, as taught in <i>Megilas Antiochos</i>
(attributed to the elders of Hillel and Shammai), forbade the observance of <i>Shabbos</i>,
<i>milah</i>, and <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>. We are not told that they forbade the
study of Torah. Where, then, is the <i>l'hashgicham Torasecha</i>? The
common denominator to these three <i>mitzvos</i> is that they are based upon <i>kedushas
Yisroel</i>. <i>Shabbos</i> is not only a practical institution, a day of rest
enabling man to be more productive in the forthcoming week, but rather a <i>yom
menucha u'kedusha</i>. It enables the Jew to connect with Hashem and His
Torah in a way that he cannot the rest of the week. Indeed, the <i>Talmud Yerushalmi</i>
(<i>Shabbos</i> 15:3) teaches that the primary purpose of <i>Shabbos</i> is to
connect with and learn the Torah he was unable to during the week.</p>



<P>A baby boy is born Jewish by virtue of his mother. Prior to
the circumcision the <i>mohel</i> announces "<i>bris kodesh</i>",
as the <i>milah</i> endows the baby with additional <i>kedusha</i>. This <i>kedusha</i>
is a prerequisite for learning Torah; the Torah <i>hakedosha</i> can only be
mastered by a person who is <i>kadosh</i>. The <i>Daas Zekeinim M'Baalei Tosafos</i>
at the beginning of <i>Parshas Mishpatim</i> relate the story of Onkelus. Born
into the royal family of Rome, he approached the Ravs and asked them to learn
Torah. They responded that <i>milah</i> was a prerequisite to study Torah. He
was circumcised and became the great Onkelus. Indeed, Rav Akiva Eiger cites in
a <i>teshuva</i> that if for any reason the father of the baby is not present
at the <i>bris</i>, the grandfather is next in line to recite the <i>beracha</i>
of <i>l'hachniso b'vriso shel Avraham Avinu</i> - as this <i>Beracha</i>
goes on the responsibility of the father to teach his son Torah, and
interestingly, the grandfather as well ash this obligation. A Jewish man who is
an <i>orel</i> - uncircumcised - cannot eat and partake of <i>kodshim</i>
(offerings), as food endowed with sanctity can only be eaten by one who has
additional <i>kedusha</i>.</p>



<P><i>Rosh Chodesh</i> is a further representation of the
ability of the Jew to sanctify. Indeed the Jewish holidays not only separate us
from the non-Jewish society, but they reflect our ability to endow time with <i>kedusha</i>.
The <i>beracha</i> of <i>Kiddush</i> on the <i>Shalosh Regalim</i> is "<i>mekadaish
Yisroel vehazemanim</i> - who sanctifies Israel who in turn sanctify the
holidays."</p>



<P>The Greeks valued wisdom and revered Socrates and Aristotle.
They respected Torah as another branch on the tree of knowledge, together with
all other branches. Math, science, Torah and music were all to be studied by
cultured man. The Greeks could not accept, however, that a particular branch
was holier and was to be treated and studied in sanctity. "A craftsman
hates his fellow artisans" (<i>Braishis Rabbah</i> 19:4), as they
represent a threat to his turf and sphere of influence. Torah as wisdom they
respected, Torah as <i>chochma Elokis</i> - Divine knowledge - they
ardently rejected.</p>



<P>Our Torah mandates that "<i>Kudsha Brich Hu
v'Oraysa chad hu</i> - Hashem and His Torah are on and inseparable.
Thus "<i>Kedoshim Tihiyu</i> - you shall be holy, for I am holy,
says Hashem" (<i>Vayikra</i> 19:2). Consequently, Torah must be studied
in an environment of <i>kedusha</i>. Hence in our prayers, "<i>kadhseinu b'mitzvosecha</i>
- sanctify us with your <i>mitzvos</i>" and <u>then</u> "<i>v'sein
chelkeinu b'sorosecha</i> - allow us to master our share of your
Torah." Regarding the construction of the <i>mishkan</i>, the Torah
charges, "they shall make a Sanctuary for Me, <i>vshachanti b'socham</i>
- so that I may dwell among them." The Ohr Hachaim <i>Hakadosh</i>
explains the sanctity of the Sanctuary is to overflow and endow holiness in
each individual. We conclude every <i>shemoneh esrei</i> with the prayer <i>sheyobaneh
Beis Hamikdash</i> - that the third temple speedily be rebuilt and <i>vsain
chelkeinu b'Torasecha</i> - in the environment of greater sanctity
we will merit a greater participation in Torah.</p>



<P>Yes, the Greeks attempted <i>l'hashgicham Torasecha</i>
- to cause Israel to forget Your Torah. The emphasis in on the suffix of <i>Torose<u>cha</u></i>
- <u>Your</u> Torah. Their forbidding our observance of S<i>milah</i>, <i>Shabbos</i>,
and <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> was an attempt to remove <i>kedusha</i> from the Jewish
people, <i>ipso facto</i> causing a breakdown in our relationship to Hashem and
His Torah. We are too familiar with <i>Peasch</i> cleaning. Even children can
relate to cleaning their room for <i>Shabbos</i>. But <i>Chanukah</i> cleaning
and preparation? Yes! The Chafetz Chaim pointed out that the only time the
Torah says "<i>v'shav meiacharecha</i> - He will turn away
from you" (<i>Devarim</i> 23:15) is in a context of unholiness. We must
create a greater environment of <i>kedusha</i> within our homes which is
conducive to learning Torah and meriting an increased Divine Presence. May this
forthcoming <i>Chanukah</i> inspire us to merit "<i>v'haya machanecha
kadosh -</i> so your community shall be holy."</p>

<p>This week we begin <i>sefer Vayikra</i>, which concentrates
on <i>korbanos</i>. Since we have not had a <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> for almost
two thousand years, the topic of <i>korbanos</i> seems remote, removed, and
foreign to us. I'd like to begin by listing the many ways that the <i>korban
Pesach</i> impacts upon us.</p>

<ol>
 <li>While the <i>yom tov</i> of <i>Pesach </i>does not begin
     until the night of the fifteenth of Nissan, one is forbidden&nbsp; to eat <i>chometz</i>
     on <i>erev Pesach </i>from midday (<i>Devarim</i> 16:3), as that is the
     time when the <i>korban Pesach</i> was slaughtered.</li>
 <li>One is not to own <i>chometz</i> on <i>erev Pesach</i>, as
     the Torah says, "you shall not slaughter my blood offering (i.e. the
     <i>korban Pesach</i>) while in possession of <i>chmoetz</i>" (<i>Shemos</i>
     24:25)</li>
 <li>The <i>mishna</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 4:1) teaches that from midday on <i>erev Pesach</i> it is forbidden to work, as one is restricted from working
     whenever their <i>korban</i> was brought. Thus, <i>erev Pesach</i>
     starting from midday, i.e. the time for bringing the <i>korban Pesach</i>,
     is to be treated like <i>chol hamoed</i>, even outside of <i>Eretz Yisroel</i></li>
 <li>Unlike Shabbos, which one may begin from p<i>lag hamincha</i>
     (a <i>halachik</i> hour and a quarter prior to sunset) and eat their Shabbos
     meal while it is still day (Friday), one is not to begin the <i>Pesach seder</i>
     until night. The reason for this is that the Torah ordains that the <i>Pesach
     </i>is to be eaten at night (<i>Shemos</i> 12:8) and all the other <i>mitzvos</i>
     of the night go into affect with the time of the <i>korban Pesach</i></li>
 <li>The custom of wearing a <i>kitul </i>at the <i>seder</i>
     is explained by the Netziv in his <i>Hagadah</i> as a remembrance to the
     white robe on donned when eating <i>kodshim</i> (sacrifices).</li>
 <li>The custom of having the <i>zroa</i> on the <i>sder</i>
     plate is to recall the <i>korban Pesach</i>. The placing of the
     hard-boiled egg is to remember the <i>korban chagigah</i></li>
 <li>We wash our hands prior to eating <i>karpas</i>. The
     vegetable is dipped in salt water (<i>dovor shetibulo bemashke</i>), and
     such dipped items require hand washing when one eats the wet food. The Taz
     points to this practice and sharply criticizes those who are not careful
     to wash their hands before eating a wet fruit or vegetable all year long.
     One could defend the practice of "<i>urchatz</i>" not only to
     arouse the curiosity of the young, but to conduct ourselves on this night
     in keeping with the way all practiced when we had a <i>Beis Hamikdash</i></li>
 <li>Rav Chaim Brisker <i>zt"l</i>&nbsp; explained that
     the purpose of the custom of hiding the <i>matzah</i> designated as <i>afikoman</i>
     after <i>yachatz</i> is not only to maintain the interest and excitement
     of the children, but also is connected to the <i>korban Pesach</i>. The <i>afikoman
     </i>is eaten at the end of the meal as a remembrance of the <i>korban
     Pesach</i>, and the <i>korban Pesach</i> needed <i>shemira</i> (guarding)
     and <i>hesech hadaas</i>(lapse in awareness) could disqualify the <i>Pesach</i>
     lest it became <i>tamei </i>(impure). To avoid such disqualification, the <i>korban
     Pesach </i>was kept in a safe place until the time it was eaten, hence our
     <i>minhag</i> to hide the <i>afikoman</i>. It would therefore make sense
     for the one conducting the <i>seder</i> to hide the <i>afikoman</i>, not
     the children.</li>
 <li>While we point to the <i>matzah</i> and <i>marror</i> when
     we explain their significance as part of <i>Rabban Shomin ben Gamliel haya
     omer</i>, we do not point to the shank bone, lest we assign it the actual
     status of a <i>korban Pesach</i>.</li>
 <li>The <i>mitzvah </i>of eating <i>marror</i> today is only a
     <i>mitzvah miderabanan</i> (Ravnic <i>mitzvah</i>). It is <i>doraysa </i>(Biblical)
     only when it accompanies the <i>korban Pesach</i>.</li>
 <li>The custom of <i>Ashkenzim</i> is to abstain from eating
     roasted meat at the <i>sder</i> lest one assume they are eating the <i>korban
     Pesach</i>, which would be a violation of <i>kodshim bachutz</i>.</li>
 <li>In keeping with the opinion of Rosh, the <i>afikoman</i>
     is eaten at the end of the meal, just as the <i>korban Pesach</i> was
     eaten "<i>al hasovah</i> - when they were full", and
     serves as a remembrance of the <i><u>korban Pesach</u></i>. According to Rashbam,
     the <i>afikoman</i>, the fulfillment of the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>matzah</i>,
     is eaten at the end of the meal as a remembrance of the <i><u>matzah</u></i>
     that was eaten with the <i>korban Pesach</i> at the end of the meal. Both
     Rosh and Rashbam agree that it is preferable to eat the <i>afikoman</i>
     prior to <i>chatzos</i>, as was the <i>korban Pesach</i>.</li>
 <li>Rav Yosef Salant <i>zt"l</i> (in Be'er Yosef) explains
     that the practice of opening the door after <i>birkas hamazon</i> is not
     only to welcome Eliyahu <i>hanavi</i> ushering in the future redemption.
     One had to eat the <i>korban Pesach</i> on the ground level, as the roofs
     and upper floors in <i>Yerushalayim</i> did not share the <i>kedusha</i>
     of the rest of the city that enables the consumption of the <i>korban
     Pesach</i>. The door was kept closed during the meal lest one take the <i>korban
     Pesach</i> outside or upstairs, and after the meal the Jews went onto the
     rooftops to sing <i>Hallel</i>. We open our doors today in remembrance of
     this sequence.</li>
</ol>



<p>There is one additional way that the <i>korban Pesach</i>
impacts upon our <i>seder</i>. The word <i>seder</i> means a prescribed order
of events. Out of the fifteen components of this <i>seder</i>, the first
fourteen are all some type of action (including the fourteenth - <i>Hallel</i>
- the recitation of the second half of <i>Hallel</i>). The last component
is somewhat challenging. <i>Nirtzah</i> means acceptance, and we <i>daven</i>
that our <i>seder</i> will be accepted On High. For this reason the Chidah in
his <i>Hagadah</i> (Simchas Haregel) lists only fourteen components, counting <i>Hallel</i>
and <i>nirtzah</i> as one.</p>



<p>However, in light of the impact of the <i>korban Pesach</i>
on our <i>seder</i>, the final component takes on great meaning. <i>Nirtzah</i>
comes from the <i>passuk</i> (<i>Vayikra</i> 1:4), "<i>vnirtzah lo lechaper
alav</i> - it shall become acceptable to him, to atone for him."
The term <i>ritzui</i> is only found after and in conjunction with <i>korbanos</i>.
We don't ask for <i>ritzui</i> after affixing a <i>mezuzah</i>, wearing <i>tefillin</i>,
etc. We do, however, conclude every <i>shemoneh esrei</i> with the prayer of <i>retzei</i>.
Since our daily <i>tefillah</i> substitute for the daily <i>korbanos</i> in the
<i>beis hamikdash</i>, we conclude our <i>tefillos</i> appropriately with a
supplication of <i>ritzui</i>.</p>


<p>If our Ravs looked upon the <i>seder</i> only as the
performance of a set of <i>mitzvos</i> (<i>matzah, hagadah, daled kosos, marror,
</i>etc.) there would be no place for <i>nirtzah</i>. However, the text of <i>nirtzah</i>
exclaims, "as we have carried out the Pesach observance of this <i>seder</i>,
so may we merit to fulfill the actual <i>korban Pesach</i> in the
future." We are asking Hashem to accept our <i>seder</i> as a partial
fulfillment of the <i>korban Pesach</i>, and thus the inclusion of <i>ritzui</i>
is appropriate.</p>


<p>This special request, that our <i>seder</i> partially
replace a <i>korban Pesach</i>, can only take place in an environment of <i>kedusha</i>.
While it is true all year that, "when we were privileged to have a <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i> the <i>mizbeach</i> was <i>mechaper</i>; now <i>shulchano shel adam</i>
is <i>mechaper</i>" (<i>Berachos</i> 55a), this is especially true at the
Pesach <i>seder</i>. I have witnessed how not yet observant families who
participated at a Pesach <i>seder</i> found the experience to be transforming,
to the point that they embraced a Torah observant lifestyle. Make your <i>seder</i>
count. Not only during <i>maggid</i> should there be an exciting give and take
among all the participants, but even the discussions during the meal should be
channeled to reflect "<i>ashreinu matov chelkeinu umanaim goraleinu</i>."</p>

		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The Rambam often closes specific sections of <i>Halacha</i>
with an <i>aggadic</i> or moral teaching. Thus it is not surprising that at the
conclusion of <i>Hilchos Lulav</i> (8:15) he does the same. What is surprising,
however, is the specific teaching he chooses. The last <i>halachic</i> topic he
deals with there is the special <i>simcha</i> that was present at the <i>Simchas
Beis Hashoeva</i> celebrations in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> during <i>Succos. </i>The
Rambam then teaches that the emotion with which one performs <i>mitzvos</i> is
so significant that if the performance lacks happiness and joy, one is fit for
Divine retribution, as it says, "because you did not serve Hashem, your
G-d, amid gladness and goodness of heart" (<i>Devarim</i> 28:47). One
would have expected that his final teaching would be related to <i>kabbolas
pnei haShechina</i> (greeting the Divine presence, as was done at the <i>Simchas
Beis Hashoeva</i>), perhaps throughout the year in our synagogues and study
halls, and we would have placed this lesson regarding the importance of
performing <i>mitzvos</i> with enthusiasm earlier in <i>Hilchos De'os</i> where
Rambam discusses the overall character of man.</p>



<P>I heard from one of my teachers a fascinating explanation as
to why the Rambam ends <i>Hilchos Lulav</i> with the concept of <i>simcha shel
mitzvah</i>. The Yalkut Shimoni (<i>Tehillim</i> 102:19) cites the verse
"Let this be recorded for a later generation, so that the newborn people
will praise G-d." Commenting on "<i>v'am nivrah yehallel Kah</i>
- so that the newborn people will praise G-d" the Ravs ask: is
there a nation yet to be reborn? Rather the verse refers to the generations
that are "as dead" in their actions and <i>mitzvos</i>, and they
pray and beseech Hashem on <i>Rosh Hashana</i>&nbsp;and <i>Yom Kippur</i> and
G-d recreates them, giving them another opportunity. What is this <i>am nivrah</i>
- this newly created nation - to do? They are to "<i>yehallel
Kah</i>" - to take their <i>Lulav</i> and <i>Esrog</i> and praise Hashem
therewith. Why specifically with the four species?</p>



<P><i>Rabbeinu</i> Bachaya in his commentary on <i>Parshas Emor</i>
and in his <i>Kad Hamkemach</i> explains why these four <i>minim</i> were
singled out for the <i>mitzvah</i> on <i>Succos</i>. The essence of the fruit,
he notes, is its moisture, as the text states (<i>Devorim</i> 12:25) "<i>ki
hadam hu hanefesh</i> - for the blood, it is the life". Similarly,
in the world of vegetation the moisture contained within comprises its life and
freshness. These four species reflect the freshness endowed within them, and
they are taken as a symbol of vibrancy and life, with which to praise Hashem
for His renewing us and giving us a second chance to serve Him.</p>



<P>The <i>halacha</i> is that a dry <i>lulav</i> is <i>pasul</i>
(may not be used) for the <i>mitzvah</i>. Though it is clearly recognizable as
a <i>lulav</i>, the Raavad (<i>Hilchos Lulav</i>, 8:9) explains that a dried
out, i.e. dead, <i>lulav</i> can not be used for serving Hashem, as the <i>passuk</i>
(<i>Tehillim </i>115:12) says, "<i>lo hameisim yehalelu Kah</i> -
the dead can not praise G-d." Thus, the <i>lulav</i> and its components
were chosen as the medium to thank Hashem for the opportunity to serve Him with
excitement and enthusiasm, as they themselves bespeak life.</p>



<P>Regarding man, in <i>Parshas Breishis</i> (2:7) we are
taught, "<i>vayipach b'apav nishmas chaim</i> - He blew into his
nostrils the soul of life." There is man with a soul, alive, energetic,
with great and unlimited potential, and there is man without a soul, lifeless.
Similarly, there are the <i>mitzvos</i> of man with and without a soul. A <i>mitzvah
</i>performed with <i>simcha</i> - happiness and joy - is a <i>mitzvah</i>
possessing a soul, and the same <i>mitzvah</i> performed perfunctorily, out of
habit and routine, is literally lifeless.</p>



<P>Many have the practice, based on the Ari <i>z"l</i>
and Shalah <i>Hakadosh</i>, to fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> of picking up the
four minim in the <i>Succah.</i> Perhaps the message is that one needs the
environment of the <i>Succah</i>, which reminds the dweller that he has left
his permanent residence to dwell in a temporary one, literally in Hashem's home
and presence, to enable him to perform <i>mitzvos</i> with excitement and the realization
that one is in Hashem's presence. Too often throughout the year we are so
distracted that we fail to be cognizant of our performing <i>mitzvos</i> in the
presence of, and praying literally to, Hashem. The Chofetz Chain <i>zt"l</i>
in his <i>Shem Olam</i> writes "tell me truthfully my brothers - do
you consider the closeness and potential of man to G-d on a daily basis, weekly
basis, monthly or even annual basis?" The Rambam writes that the <i>simcha</i>
accompanying our <i>mitzvos </i>is to be there all the time, but we learn it
from <i>lulav</i>, hence he teaches this lesson here in <i>Hilchos Lulav</i>
and not in <i>Hilchos De'os</i>.</p>

<P>In enumerating the prohibitions that characterize the unique <i>
kedusha</i> of the <i>kohein</i>, the Torah adds a commandment that appears somewhat
superfluous:&nbsp; "<i>Uf'as z'kanam
Lo YiGaleichu</i>" - they shall not cut the corner of their
beards (21:5).&nbsp; If the prohibition of "<i>giluach</i>"<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>
applies to all Jews, why does the Torah reiterate it specifically with the
prohibitions that are exclusive to the <i>kohanim</i>?&nbsp; The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Yevamos</i> 5a) derives from this aberrant
placement that while the <i>giluach</i> of a non-<i>kohein</i> violates a single
<i>lav</i>, the <i>giluach</i> of a <i>kohein</i> transgresses <i>both</i> a <i>lav</i> and an<i>
 asseh</i>.&nbsp; Thus, a <i>kohein</i> who shaves his beard in an inappropriate manner violates two commandments, while a non-<i>
kohein</i> who performs the same act violates a single commandment.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Having established the unique nature of a <i>kohein's</i> prohibition of <i>giluach</i>, the <i>
Gemara</i> subsequently attempts to prove that a single <i>mitzvas asseh </i>can override a combination of an <i>asseh</i>
<i>and</i> a <i>lav</i>, from the case of a <i>kohein</i> who is a <i>metzorah</i>.&nbsp; As part
of the prescribed purification procedure detailed in <i>Parshas Metzorah</i>, a <i>metzorah</i>
must shave his beard and <i>peyos</i>,an action prohibited under normal circumstances by the prohibition of <i>
giluach</i>.&nbsp; If, as the <i>Gemara</i> just established, a <i>
kohein's</i> <i>giluach </i>constitutes <i>both</i>
an <i>asseh </i>and a <i>lav</i>, and there is only a single <i>
asseh </i>for a <i>metzorah</i> to purify himself, apparently the single <i>
asseh</i> of his purification can override <i>both</i> the <i>lav</i>
and <i>asseh</i> of <i>giluach</i> of a <i>kohein</i>.&nbsp; This case would thus seem to violate the
common Talmudic dictum, "<i>ain asseh docheh lo sa'aseh v'asseh</i>" - a single positive
commandment cannot override a negative and positive commandment in tandem.&nbsp; </p>

<P>The <i>Gemara</i> ultimately dismisses this
proof, however, noting that the limited application of the prohibition of <i>
giluach</i> (Rashi: women are not included in
the prohibition) classifies it as that which is<i>
aino shaveh b'kol</i>.&nbsp; As such, this prohibition is
unsuitable to serve as a paradigm for other, more universal commandments that
apply to all Jews (<i>shaveh b'kol</i>).&nbsp;
Thus, although the case of a <i>kohein</i>
<i>metzora</i> appears to suggest that a
single <i>asseh</i> can override a
combination of both a <i>lav</i> and an <i>
asseh</i>, the uniqueness of this particular
case renders it unfit to establish a general principle for all
commandments.&nbsp; </p>

<P>Noting
the <i>Gemara</i>'s dismissal of
the <i>kohein</i> <i>
metzora</i> as a potential model, Tosafos
(ibid. s.v. "<i>V'acati</i>")
ask a basic question.&nbsp; Granted that the case of the <i>
giluach</i> of the <i>kohein</i> <i>metzora</i>
cannot serve as a model for other cases of <i>asseh
docheh lo sa'aseh v'asseh</i> (because <i>
giluach</i> is <i>aino shaveh b'kol</i>); but the <i>Gemara</i> should at least derive that an <i>
asseh</i> is <i>docheh</i>
a <i>lo sa'aseh v'asseh <b>she'aino shaveh b'kol</b></i>?&nbsp;
That is, we should infer from the <i>kohein</i>
<i>metzora</i> that a single positive
commandment can deflect a negative and positive commandment in tandem, provided
that we are dealing with a combination of a negative and positive commandment
that is not applicable to everyone, like <i>giluach</i>?</p>

<P>Tosafos
point out that the assumption of such a rule, however, would conflict with a
later statement of the <i>Gemara</i>.&nbsp;
In <i>Yevamos</i> 20a, the <i>
Gemara</i> explores the case of a <i>
kohein gadol</i> who must perform <i>
yibum</i> on his deceased brother's
wife.&nbsp; If the deceased brother had already performed <i>
nissuin</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title="">[2]</a>,
this situation presents a serious problem.&nbsp; After all, a <i>
kohein gadol</i> is prohibited by a <i>
lav</i> from marrying a widow, and he is
further enjoined by an <i>asseh</i> to
marry a <i>besulah. </i>&nbsp;The <i>
Gemara</i> notes that although <i>
yibum</i> is a positive commandment which can
override a single negative commandment (<i>esseh
docheh lo sa'aseh</i>), it cannot override both a positive <i>
and</i> a negative commandment (<i>
ain esseh dochel lo sa'aseh v'asseh</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
What emerges from this <i>Gemara</i>, Tosafos
point out, is that the <i>Gemara</i> is
indeed willing to apply the restriction of <i>ain
esseh dochel lo sa'aseh v'asseh</i> even when dealing with a
prohibition which is "<i>aino shaveh b'kol</i>."&nbsp;
Our <i>Gemara</i>'s conclusion
thus appears to contradict the conclusion of the <i>Gemara</i> on 20a.</p>

<P>Tosafos
resolve the apparent contradiction by refining our understanding of the
injunction against a <i>kohein gadol</i>
marrying a widow.&nbsp; Tosafos suggest that the <i>asseh</i> and <i>lav</i>
of the <i>kohein gadol</i> are actually
considered to be "<i>shaveh b'kol</i>"
- universally applicable.&nbsp; Even though these commandments
specifically address the <i>kohein gadol</i>,
they also apply to his wife.&nbsp; Thus, if a <i>kohein
gadol</i> marries a widow, <i>both</i>
he and his wife violate the prohibition of the forbidden union.&nbsp; Since the
<i>kohein gadol's</i> wife is not
a <i>kohein gadol</i>, yet is still
subject to the injunction, Tosafos adduce that the <i>lav</i> and <i>asseh </i>of
a <i>kohein gadol</i> not marrying a
widow can indeed apply to anyone, and are thus considered "<i>
shaveh b'kol.</i>"&nbsp; Thus, the
conclusion of <i>Yevamos</i> 5a that an <i>
asseh</i> can indeed be <i>
docheh</i> a <i>lo
sa'aseh v'asseh she'ain shaveh b'kol</i> stands,
and the case of a <i>kohein gadol</i> performing
yibum on a widow presents no challenge to this rule, as such a case involves a <i>
lo sa'aseh v'aseh </i>which are
actually <i>shavin b'kol</i>.</p>

<P>The
Ran (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 18a) proposes a
different solution to the apparent contradiction.&nbsp; Unlike Tosafos, the Ran
assumes that the inability of a <i>kohein</i>
to marry a widow is indeed considered to be "<i>aino</i> <i>shaveh b'kol,"
</i>and that this combination of a positive and negative commandment is
indeed overridden by the positive commandment of <i>yibum</i>, which is <i>shaveh b'kol</i>.&nbsp;
The <i>Gemara's</i> reason for
forbidding this <i>yibum</i> is simply a
Ravnic enactment.&nbsp; In theory, however, the <i>yibum</i> could certainly override the prohibitions.</p>

<P>In
formulating his opinion, the Ran assumes that the mitzvah of <i>
yibum</i> itself is considered to be that
which is "<i>shaveh b'kol</i>"
- applying both to men and women.&nbsp; This assumption, however, is not
unanimously accepted.&nbsp; The <i>Chinuch</i>
(598), for example, assumes that the Mitzvah applies solely to males.&nbsp;
Presumably Tosafos (<i>Gittin</i> 41a s.v.
"<i>Lisah</i>") agree with
the Ran's opinion, that both men and women are obligated in <i>
yibum</i><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title="">[3]</a>.</p>

<P>Tosafos
and the Ran's debate on this issue stemmed from the apparent superfluity
of the Torah's commandment against Kohanim performing <i>
giluach</i>, a sin that is prohibited even to
non-<i>kohanim</i>. &nbsp;Interestingly,
<i>Parshas Emor's haftarah</i>
presents a similarly redundant commandment as well.&nbsp; In this week's <i>
haftarah</i>, the <i>navi</i> Yechezkel states (44:31) : "<i>
kol n'veilah u'treifa min ha'of u'min
ha'b'heima lo yochlu hakohanim" </i>- that the <i>
kohanim</i> shall not eat any <i>
neveila</i> or <i>tereifa</i> from fowl or animals.&nbsp; Like the prohibition of <i>
giluach</i>, this commandment appears somewhat
superfluous.&nbsp; After all, if every Jew is enjoined to refrain from
non-kosher meat, why are the <i>kohanim</i>
singled out?&nbsp; </p>

<P>The
apparent superfluities of our <i>parsha</i>
and our <i>haftara</i> suggest that the
unique <i>kedusha</i> of the <i>
kohein</i> is not restricted solely to
exclusive <i>mitzvos</i> of the <i>
kehuna</i>.&nbsp; Rather, the <i>
kohein's</i> <i>kedusha</i> expresses itself in every aspect of his life, even
in <i>mitzvos</i> that are not
specifically addressed to the <i>kohanim</i>.&nbsp;
The pervasiveness of his <i>kedusha</i>
affects even shared <i>mitzvos</i>, such
as <i>giluach </i>and <i>
kashrus</i>, elevating them to a qualitatively
different level.&nbsp; Rather than being compartmentalized or confined to
specific areas of <i>halacha</i>, the <i>
kohein's</i> <i>kedusha</i> is holistic, encompassing every dimension of his
life in an equal fashion.&nbsp; At the <i>levaya</i>
of Rav Moshe Feinstein, zt"l Rav Nissan Alpert zt"l pointed out
that one of the <i>pesulim</i> of a <i>kohein</i> described in our <i>parsha</i> is a "<i>
Saruah</i>" (21:18), which Rashi defines as one whose limbs are uneven.&nbsp; Rav Alpert suggested that this <i>
pesul</i> represents the need for an even distribution of <i>kedusha</i> throughout all aspects of a <i>kohein's</i>
life. Just as one arm may not be longer than the other, so too one dimension of a <i>kohein's</i> life may not be
holier than another.</p>

<P>The lesson of the holistic <i>kedusha</i> of the <i>kohein</i> holds true not merely for <i>kohanim</i> themselves, but for
all <i>Bnei Torah</i> as well.&nbsp; As members of <i>Klal Yisrael</i>, we are required to maintain the highest standards of sanctity in all areas of our
lives.&nbsp; <i>Kedusha</i> and high ethical conduct are not confined to the walls of the <i>Beis Medrash</i> or the <i>Shul</i>,
but must rather evenly pervade our entire existence, in each and every endeavor that we undertake.</p>

<p>At first glance, <i>Esav HaRasha</i>'s sale of the <i>bechora</i> to <i>Yaakov
Avinu</i> presents numerous challenges, in both<i> Halachah</i> and <i>Hashkafa</i>.
From a <i>Halachic</i> perspective, how could <i>Esav</i> sell an intangible <i>bechora</i>
which promised entitlements that would only materialize in the future? Was this
sale not a violation of the principle codified by the <i>Rambam</i> (<i>Hilchos
Mechira</i> 22:1) in accordance with the view of the <i>Chachamim</i>: "<i>ain
adam makneh davar she'lo bah l'olam</i>" - a person cannot sell
or purchase that which has not yet come to fruition? How could Yaakov possibly
buy rights such as "<i>Pi Sh'nayim</i>" (the double
inheritance of the firstborn) which were entirely intangible and undeveloped?</p>

<P><i>Rivash</i>
(<i>Shu</i>"<i>t</i> <i>Rivash</i> 328) quotes the <i>Rosh</i> who suggests
that although the <i>bechorah</i> does indeed constitute a "<i>davar she'lo
bah l'olam</i>," <i>Yaakov</i> was nonetheless able to purchase it
because he insisted that Esav swear to consummate the sale ("<i>Hishav'a
Li&#8230;Vayishava Lo</i>"). While a "<i>davar she'lo bah l'olam</i>"
is usually not subject to sale, if accompanied by an oath, even such an item
may be sold. <i>Rivash</i>, however, disputes this principle, maintaining that
even when accompanied by an oath, a "<i>davar she'lo bah l'olam</i>"
may not be sold. Rather, he explains the Parsha's transaction by noting
that the entire episode occurred prior to the giving of the Torah. As such, conundrums
based on normative <i>Halachah</i> are entirely irrelevant. </p>

<P>We
are thus presented with two possible explanations for <i>Yaakov Avinu</i>'s
ability to purchase the <i>bechora</i>, a "<i>davar she'lo bah l'olam</i>."
Either, as the <i>Rosh</i> maintains, a "<i>davar she'lo bah l'olam</i>"
may be purchased when accompanied by an oath; or, as <i>Rivash</i> maintains,
the entire episode occurred before the laws of "<i>kinyanim</i>"
were given to <i>Bnai Yisrael</i>. What underlies the dispute between <i>Rivash</i>
and the <i>Rosh</i>?</p>

<P>Perhaps
this issue may depend on why it is that we assume that a person may not sell or
purchase a "<i>davar she'lo bah l'olam</i>." Perhaps
this limitation is a function of the lack of an object or "<i>cheftza</i>"
- that is, in order for a "<i>kinyan</i>" to take effect,
there must be something tangible for it to latch on to. Because a "<i>davar
she'lo bah l'olam</i>" is entirely intangible, there can be
no "<i>chalos</i>" (taking effect) of the <i>kinyan</i>. Indeed, <i>Kiryas
Sefer</i> (<i>Hilchos Mechira</i>, 22) seems to subscribe to such a
possibility. Alternatively, however, one can understand the deficiency of a
"<i>davar she'lo bah l'olam</i>" as lying in the realm
of "<i>semichus da'as</i>." A <i>kinyan</i> requires a
certain level of intent and awareness. If something has not yet come to
fruition, however; if it is merely a "possibility" as opposed to an
"actuality," perhaps the seller or buyer is not wholeheartedly
committing to the terms of the deal. Such a possibility is suggested by <i>Rabeinu
Tam</i> (<i>Sefer HaYashar</i>, 592) and <i>Tosafos HaRosh</i> (brought in <i>Shita
Mekubetzes</i>, <i>Bava Basra</i> 142b). &nbsp;</p>

<P>If
we are to assume that the deficiency of a <i>kinyan</i> on a "<i>Davar she'lo
bah l'olam</i>" lies in the absence of any "<i>cheftza</i>,"
then whether or not <i>Esav</i> took an oath should bear little relevance on
the effectiveness of the <i>kinyan</i>, as <i>Rivash </i>seems to maintain. If,
however, the deficiency of "<i>Davar she'lo bah l'olam</i>"
lies in the concern that the parties involved may not have a completely committed
mindset, perhaps the imposition of an oath, which manifests complete and
premeditated awareness and commitment, may solve the problem, as the <i>Rosh</i>
maintains. According to such an explanation, when <i>Yaakov Avinu</i> asked <i>Esav</i>
to swear, he essentially proved that <i>Esav</i> was completely aware of the
ramifications of his actions, and a <i>kinyan</i> could thus take effect even
on a "<i>davar she'lo bah l'olam</i>."</p>

<P><i>Sforno</i>
suggests a further possibility to explain the sale of the <i>bechora</i>. Perhaps
the "<i>nezid</i> <i>adashim</i>" (lentil soup) served as an object
for a "<i>kinyan chalipin</i>," by which <i>Esav</i> relinquished
any claim to the <i>bechora</i>. This explanation avoids the problem of "<i>davar
she'lo bah l'olam</i>" in light of a comment of the <i>Ra'avad</i>
(<i>T'mim De'im</i>, 160) who maintains that a <i>kinyan chalipin</i>
can work even on a "<i>davar she'lo bah l'olam</i>"
(Perhaps the <i>Ra'avad</i>'s rationale may stem from his
understanding that <i>chalipin</i> exists as a fundamentally different type of <i>kinyan</i>
than other conventional methods. While other conventions serve as a "<i>hachnasah
l'reshus</i>," drawing the object physically into the domain of the
purchaser, <i>chalipin</i> may serve more as a manifestation of "<i>gemirus
da'as</i>" - complete awareness of the individual). </p>

<P>Yet
a fourth possible explanation for <i>Yaakov Avinu</i>'s ability to
purchase the <i>bechora</i> is suggested by the <i>Rashbam</i>, who applies the
concept of "<i>simtuta</i>." "<i>Simtuta</i>" refers to
a <i>kinyan</i> which is not one of the classically listed means of
acquisition, but rather an adopted human convention that signifies agreement of
transfer. A classic example of a <i>simtuta</i> might be a handshake. <i>Rashbam</i>
suggests that perhaps breaking bread and eating lentil soup may have served as
a form of <i>simtuta</i>. If this is the case, <i>Yaakov</i>'s purchase
can be understood by the <i>Mordechai</i>&#8216;s comment (<i>Shabbos</i> 471)
that <i>simtuta</i> <i>can </i>effect acquisition even on a "<i>Davar she'lo
bah l'olam</i>."</p>

<P>On
a <i>Hashkafic</i> level, perhaps the sale of a "<i>davar she'lo
bah l'olam</i>" highlights the essence of <i>Esav</i>'s
willingness to give up so much for so little. While the <i>bechora</i> entitles
its possessor to various different privileges and entitlements, the common
thread that links all of these rights is the fact that here and now, they meant
absolutely nothing. They are the quintessential "<i>davar she'lo
bah l'olam</i>." In <i>Esav</i>'s eyes, the privileges of the
<i>bechora</i> constituted, at best, a long-term investment which would not
come to fruition without the passage of a great deal of time. To <i>Yaakov</i>,
however, these privileges represented life's ultimate goal. <i>Yaakov</i>
was the "<i>ish tam yosheiv ohalim</i>" who invested years upon
years in the <i>Beis Medrash</i>; the devoted shepherd who faithfully tended to
and nurtured his flock, year in and year out. Through his life experiences, he recognized
that greatness can only come with great investment. <i>Esav, </i>however,
looked for immediate returns and instant gratification. As an "<i>Ish Yodeiah
Tzayid</i>," an impetuous hunter who seeks immediate profit with every
kill, <i>Esav</i> could not possibly look beyond the immediate present to a
grander future. The sale of the <i>bechora</i> thus underscores the primacy of the
Jew's consistent efforts and long-term vision in his service of <i>HaKadosh
Baruch Hu</i>. The absence of immediate returns should never deter us from
life's ultimate goals. &nbsp;</p>

<P><i>Parshas Behaaloscha</i> is a kind of rollercoaster in
terms of the historical events of the Jewish people. On the one hand we find
Moshe excitedly inviting Yisro to accompany <i>Bnai Yisroel</i>, as "<i>nosim
anachnu</i> - we are going" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 10:29) - one can sense the enthusiasm, and even Moshe is planning to enter the promised land.
Immediately after the two <i>pesukim</i> bounded by the inverted <i>nun</i>s,
Jewish history becomes inverted and a rapid decline begins, with the nation
bemoaning and mourning its plight. This is followed by the sending of the spies
and the rest is tragic history.</p>



<P>What is especially uncharacteristic is the role of Moshe in
the backsliding of the people. Moshe throws his hands up in desperation and
frustration and responds to their complaints regarding their unhappiness with
the additional laws of morality<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>
they were now bound by and their desiring <i>cholent</i> rather than the divine
diet of <i>man</i> by saying, "are they my children? Did I give birth to
them?" "Help Me", cries Moshe, "if not, please kill me
and put an end to my misery." In contrast, when the Jewish people worshiped
the golden calf, Moshe rose to the occasion and defended their idolatrous
backsliding. Moshe reminded Hashem where they were for two hundred and ten
years, and despite the open miracles they saw and experienced, their being
steeped in Egyptian culture could explain and defend their sin. Moshe had all
the necessary patience and tolerance for His people. Yet here, by <i>kivros haTaavah</i>,
the same Moshe asks, "Am I their nursemaid?" (<i>Bamidbar</i>
11:12).</p>



<P>The Rav <i>zt"l</i> suggested the following
explanation: Moshe saw his role as the nation's teacher. As such, he
understood that he had to respond to the theological issues and questions of
the students - the issue of <i>tzaddik v'ra lo</i> (why the seemingly
good people suffer - <i>Berachos</i> 7a) is a real issue that he must
grapple with and regarding which he must guide the people. Moshe assumed that
teaching them how to navigate the written Torah with the Oral Law, adjudicating
their quarrels, etc. were integral parts of his job description. However Moshe
did not realize that teaching <i>middos</i>, developing their character, and
shaping their personality to make them worthy of absorbing and accepting Hashem's
Torah was incumbent upon him as well. Moshe, to his surprise, was in fact now
elevated to the position of <i>omain</i> - nursemaid and molder of
character to this nation. By proclaiming "did I give birth to this
nation?" Moshe was saying, "<u>You</u>, Hashem, created them with
the genes implanted within them, and there is nothing I can do to change their
nature", and hence Moshe's feeling of desperation and total
inadequacy. Hashem, however, instructs him otherwise!</p>



<P>Moshe, who had willingly taught them <i>deos</i> - law
and theology - now realizes that he also has to be a "<i>middos</i>
machine" to them. "<i>Gedola shimusha yoser milimuda</i> -
attending and serving one's teacher is even greater than studying Torah
under him" (<i>Berachos</i> 7b), as one learns refinement of character
from his teachers every day acts. Moshe now gained an additional understanding
of the <i>passuk</i>, "Moshe descended from the mountain to the people
and sanctified the people" (<i>Shemos</i> 19:14). Polishing and attending
to their <i>middos</i> as well as what, how, when and with whom they eat are
all the <i>rebbe's</i> concern. Moreover, the primary way to learn the
golden mean (Rambam <i>Hilchos Deos</i> 1:1) is to observe and emulate a <i>rebbe</i>.
How the <i>rebbe</i> eats, sleeps, interacts with others and his calm demeanor
are all prerequisites for Torah study and observance.</p>



<P>The Beis Halevi as a child prodigy noted from a challenging Rashi
that the Torah itself gives preference to <i>middos</i> over <i>deos</i>. Hashem
says, "<i>naaseh adam</i>- let <u>us</u> make man" (<i>Braishis</i>
 1:26). Rashi notes that even though the verse could lead to faulty <i>deos</i>
by being misunderstood to insinuate that there is more than one God, Hashem
still chose to orchestrate the creation of man by accompanying his formulation
with a most significant lesson of <i>middos</i>, i.e. that the great should
consult and give respect to those lower than themselves.</p>



<P>May we ever be inspired by Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i> and be
cognizant not only of our responsibility to teach <i>deos</i> to those around
us, but even more importantly to demonstrate <i>derech eretz kadma laTorah</i>.</p>


<hr align=left size=1 width="33%">

<p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a>
Whereas in <i>Mitzrayim</i> they were only prohibited from those incestuous
relations that are prohibited to all <i>Bnai Noach</i> (all of mankind), now
many more familial restrictions were added (Rashi, <i>Yoma</i> 75)</p>

		<date><![CDATA[2007]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: bo]]></tag>

<P>The Jewish nation was founded both individually and
collectively in a miraculous environment. Yitzchak was born of parents
regarding whom the Torah testifies, "now Avraham and Sarah were old, well
on in years, the manner of women had ceased to be with Sarah" (<i>Braishis</i>
 18:11). The enslaved nation, even prior to the exodus, witnessed the wonders
of Hashem in Egypt in conjunction with the ten plagues. They were escorted out
of Egypt with the divine cloud by day, and by night with a pillar of fire. They
walked through water on dry land and witnessed the Egyptians drown. At Marah,
the bitter waters turned sweet by throwing a bitter tree therein, and seventy
date palms granted them as they entered the desert.</p>



<P>The daily miraculous ration of <i>mon</i> that nourished
them rotted if kept overnight for the morrow, except Shabbos, when they were
commanded to take a double portion which retained its freshness. The <i>menorah</i>
was fashioned miraculously out of fire, as was the <i>briach hatichon</i>
- the one middle bar inside the planks of the <i>mishkan</i> kept all the
planks secure. For forty years they were surrounded by constant miracles. The
great importance and significance of these miracles, teaches the Ramban in <i>parshas
Bo</i>, is to impress upon the Jewish nation the close personal relationship
that Hashem has with <i>Bnei Yisroel</i>. His <i>hashgacha pratis</i> - Divine
intervention and concern for their welfare - is the cornerstone upon which the
Jewish people is founded.</p>



<P>Sadly, but realistically, the nature of man is to forget.
Not only do later generations forget the impact of miracles, but even the one
to whom the miracle occurred is wont to forget. Case in point: when King Shaul
hesitates to allow Dovid to fight Golyas, Dovid defends himself by sharing his
prowess in defending the sheep from the attack of both a lion and a bear. Dovid
said, "<i>v'nasah she meihaeider</i> - the lion or bear would
carry off a sheep" (Shmuel I 17:34). The word is written "<i>seh</i>"-
a sheep - but is read "<i>zeh</i> - this". The Vilna Gaon
(in Kol Eliyahu) explains based upon the <i>medrash</i>, Dovid slaughtered the
sheep after he saved it, and from its skin he made a vest which he wore
constantly, enabling him to remember the miracle always. If not for the vest, Dovid
would have forgotten. It is the "<i>zeh</i>" that he showed Shaul. Rav
Yerachameal Kron <i>shlit"a</i> in his <i>sefer V'Talmudo B'Yado</i>
notes that while Moshe successfully prays for the recovery of his sister
Miriam, he does not pray on his own behalf to have his speech impediment cured,
as Moshe wanted to always remember the miracle of the angel directing his
infant hand to the hot coals rather than the alluring gold (<i>Yalkut Shimoni, Shemos</i>
#166). Had his speech defect been removed, he too may have forgotten the
miracle.</p>



<P>If the direct beneficiaries of the miracle is prone to
forget it <i>rachmana litzlan</i>, all the more so their descendants and future
generations. To prevent this from happening, to keep the memory of the miracles
fresh in the minds of all generations, explains the Ramban (<i>ibid</i>), many <i>mitzvos</i>
have as their primary purpose "<i>zecher l'yitzias mitarayim</i>"
- to remember the exodus from Egypt and its accompanying miracles and
wonders. To offset the heresy that Hashem is removed from the activities of
mankind, Hashem suspends nature, and has us incorporate His miraculous
involvement as an integral part of many <i>mitzvos</i>. Thus, our donning <i>tefilin,
mezuzos</i> on our doors, the many prohibitions of <i>chometz</i> coupled with
the <i>mitzvah</i> of eating <i>matzah</i>, all keep the memory of the miracle
alive and vibrant. Our annual immigration to the <i>sukkah </i>is explained by
the Torah as "<i>l'maan yadeuh dorosaychem</i>" (<i>Vayikra</i>
23:43) - so that your generations will know that millions of people were
fed, clothed, and sustained miraculously for forty years in a desert
environment.</p>



<P>The Torah (<i>Devarim</i> 6:16) warns "<i>lo senasu</i>
- you shall not test Hashem". The Ramban understands this to mean
you are not to say that if Hashem is indeed in our midst, let Him prove Himself
by performing miracles on our behalf. This is wrong on several levels,
including a lack of trust and faith in the past performances and the inherent
deficient manner of serving Hashem - based upon a reward. Moreover, while
miracles are performed, it is not the desire of Hashem to perform open miracles
regularly, and it is the way of Hashem most often to minimize the extent of the
miracle. Thus, technically, notes the Ramban (<i>Braishis</i> 6:19), even many arks the size of Noach's ark would not suffice to house all the
animals and their provisions for a year's time. Yet, by having Noach
build a relatively large ark, the miraculous was couched within the natural
order of things.</p>



<P>The Steipler <i>zt"l</i> in his <i>sefer Chayey Olam</i>
suggests an interesting reason why miracles were the order of the day at the
foundation of our people. They needed to learn the very important lesson of our
connection to Hashem. However, the presence of open miracles diminishes the
free will of man. In addition, having witnessed open miracles the level of
expectation and accountability for man is raised, and even smaller infractions
are treated more seriously. Given the nature of man to forget the miracles, it
can only serve to create obstacles on man's behalf.</p>



<P>In the <i>bracha</i> of <i>modim</i>, we recite thrice
daily, "<i>al nisecha shebechol yom imanu</i>", we thank Hashem for
Your miracles that are with us every day. It includes the natural phenomena
around us most often taken for granted, such as the burning of oil. As R'
Chanina said (<i>Gemara Taanis</i>), "the one who endowed oil with the
ability to burn can cause vinegar to burn". It also includes the survival
of the state of Israel, surrounded by multitudes of unfriendly Arabs. It
includes His <i>hasgacha pratis</i> - direct involvement in our personal
and communal lives as the many <i>mitzvos</i> of <i>zecher l'yitzias Mitzrayim</i>
proclaim.</p>



<P>While belief in miracles is not one of the 613 <i>mitzvos</i>,
it is the theme, and at the heart of, many <i>mitzvos</i>.</p>

<P>The Talmud (<i>Brachos</i> 48b) teaches that the first three
<i>brachos</i> of <i>birchas hamazon</i> are of Biblical origin based upon the
verse, "<i>v'achalta v'savata u'veirachta es Hashem elokecha
al ha'aretz hatova asher nossan loch</i> - and you shall eat and
you shall be satisfied and you shall bless Hashem, your god, for the good land
that he gave you" (<i>Devarim</i> 8:10). The first <i>beracha</i>
acknowledges Hashem as the provider of the food. The second <i>beracha</i>
expresses our appreciation for the Land of Israel, and for two additional <i>mitzvos</i>
that are prerequisites for our retaining the land, <i>bris milah</i> and Torah.
The third <i>beracha</i> was originally a <i>beracha</i> thanking Hashem for Yeruhsalayim,
the monarchy of Dovid, and the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>. When the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>
was destroyed this <i>beracha</i> was modified to embody a prayer for the
restoration of the monarchy, Yeruhsalayim, and the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>.</p>



<P>While <i>Ashkenazim</i> generally do not say <i>amen</i>
after our own series of <i>berachos</i>, we do recite <i>amen</i> after the third
<i>beracha</i> of <i>birkas hamazon</i> - <i>bonei Yerushalayim</i>
- to indicate that the three <i>berachos</i> of biblical origin are
complete, and to note the addition of the fourth Ravnic blessing. This past
Monday we celebrated <i>Tu B'Av</i>, and the Talmud (<i>Taanis</i> 30b, <i>Bava
Basra</i> 121b) teaches that one of the causes for celebration was that after
the unsuccessful revolt of bar-Kochba the city of Betar fell, hundreds of
thousands were killed, and the Romans did not allow the Jews to bury their
dead. After several years, <i>Rabban</i> Gamliel and <i>chachmei Yavne</i>
prayed and paid significantly until permission was granted for burial.
Miraculously, though years had passed, the dead bodies were still fresh and
whole. At that time, the Ravs of Yavne instituted the fourth <i>beracha</i>
of <i>hatov v'hamaitiv</i>. "<i>Hatov</i>" extolling the
goodness of Hashem that the bodies did not decay, and "<i>ha meitiv</i>"
- who confers good - referring to the fact that ultimately, they
were buried. While this is certainly a noteworthy event, why did <i>Chazal</i>
see fit to incorporate it into <i>birkas hamazon</i>? What essential idea is
this historical event teaching us to warrant review as often as we eat a meal?
The <i>Meshech Chochmo</i> in his commentary on the <i>passuk</i> "<i>v'achalta
v'savata</i>" notes that the <i>birkas hamazon</i> contains a great
deal more than thanks to Hashem for the sustenance. He sees this prayer as a
progression and demonstration of <i>hashgacha pratis</i> throughout our
history.</p>



<P>The first <i>beracha</i> was composed by Moshe when the <i>man</i>
descended. Every aspect of this nourishment reflected Divine involvement and
participation with the people of Israel. The second <i>beracha</i>, composed by
Yehoshua, notes not only the Divine conquest of <i>Eretz Yisroel</i>, but also
how the land harmoniously interfaces with the divine law and the Jewish nation.
The third <i>beracha</i>, authored by Dovid and Shlomo, thanked Hashem for his <i>hashgacha
pratis</i> in the <i>mikdash</i> and Yerushalayim (<i>Avos</i> 5:7). Finally,
lest one believe that with the destruction of the second <i>beis hamikdash</i>
His <i>hashgacha pratis</i> over <i>Klal Yisroel</i> ceased, the miraculous
preservation of the myriads of cadavers demonstrated His continuous care and
concern for His people even when they are in <i>galus</i>. Hest the <i>beracha</i>
has been most inspirational and elevating to the oft crestfallen spirit of the
Jewish people during the long diaspora.</p>



<P>Finally, the Jewish people most recently underwent a <i>Tisha
B'av</i> and, a few days later, a <i>Shabbos Nahacmu</i>. Where does this
extraordinary capacity for resilience come from? The <i>navi </i>Micha
proclaims (7:8), "do not rejoice over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen
I rise again, though I sit in darkness, the Lord is my light." The Yalkut
(567, 568) has two significant comments to share. Firstly, when Hashem punishes
other peoples, there is no hesitation to completely wipe out a particular
nation. Regarding Egypt the Torah teaches "not one of them
survived" (<i>Shemos</i> 14:22). This is not the case with <i>Am Yisroel</i>,
where Malachi promises, "for I am Hashem, I have not changed, and you the
children of Yaakov, you have not ceased to be" (3:6). In addition, continues
the Yalkut, inherent in the very falling of Israel are the seeds for
rejuvenation; in the darkness of <i>churban</i> is the light of salvation.</p>



<P>This amazing idea is found in the <i>kinos</i> of <i>Tisha B'av</i>.
In <i>kina</i> eighteen there is a reference to the <i>keruvim</i> that the
Romans found in the <i>Kodesh Hakodashim</i>. They had the appearance of a boy
and girl embracing. The enemy paraded this around Yerushalayim proclaiming that
the Jews are involved with idolatry and immorality. In reality, explains, the <i>Bnei
Yissochor</i> based on the Talmud (<i>Yoma</i> 54b), Hashem was showing His
love for Israel even at the time of destruction.</p>



<P><i>Birkas Hamazon</i> communicates a great deal more than
"thank you Hashem for the food". It has nourished our souls with
optimism for almost two thousand years.</p>

<P>The three weeks from <i>shiva asar b'Tamuz</i> to <i>Tisha
B'Av </i>mark an intense period of universal mourning. During this time we face
the difficult challenge of <i>aveilus</i> commemorating the destruction of the <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i>. For many of us, however, this experience may seem somewhat
distant and remote. How do we internalize the loss of something that we never
witnessed and experienced. How do we, living in a blessed era or religious
freedom and growth, yearn for the building of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>?</p>



<P>A profound lesson can be gleaned from the plight of the <i>eved
ivri</i>, the Jewish bondsman. The Torah (<i>Shemos</i> 21) allows the court to
sell a thief into slavery to raise funds to pay his victims. If after six years
of servitude he chooses to remain a slave his ear is bored. Rashi (21:6) cites
the <i>Gemara</i>&nbsp;(<i>Kiddushin</i> 22b) which states, "<i>u'ma
ra'ah ozen leiratza mikol sha'ar eivarim shebaguf? Amar Rabban Yochanan ben
Zakai, ozen shesham'a al Har Sinai 'Lo Signov' v'halach v'ganav teiratze</i>
- and what is it about the ear that it should be bored of all the organs
of the body? Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai said it was the ear that heard at Mt.
Sinai 'You shall not steal', and yet he went and stole, therefore let it be
bored."</p>



<P>The Maharal Diskin questions the timing of the boring of the
ear. If the purpose of <i>retzia</i> is to teach the <i>eved</i> the lesson of <i>lo
signov</i>, why do we pierce his ear now - wouldn't it be more fitting to
pierce his ear at the time that he stole? The Maharal Diskin explains that the
true punishment for stealing was his being sold as a slave. However, when his
years of servitude come to an end and he proclaims, "<i>lo eitzei chofshi</i>-
I shall not go free", it becomes clear that what was intended as a
punishment was perceived by the <i>eved</i> as an ideal. It now becomes necessary
to punish him again by boring his ear.</p>



<P><i>Golus</i> is a punishment. Our challenge, especially
during these three weeks, is to realize that although <i>b'chasdei Hashem</i>
we live in a time of abundant <i>beracha</i>, nevertheless "<i>U'Mipnai
chatoeinu galinu meiartzeinu</i> - because of our sins we were exiled
from our land."</p>

<P>The mitzvah of "<i>zechiras yetziyas Mitzrayim</i>,"
remembering the Exodus, occupies an incontrovertibly prominent position in
Jewish consciousness. Ramban (<i>Shemos</i> 13:16) notes that the Jew's
constant recollection of <i>yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> attests to his unwavering
belief in the veracity of the Creator and His Torah, and that "Because <i>HaKadosh
Baruch Hu</i> will not perform overt miracles in every generation to (convince)
the wicked and the deniers, He commanded us to make a constant recollection of
what our eyes saw, and to transmit the matter to our children, and from their
children to their children, until the final generation." In underscoring
the significance of this commandment, Ramban enumerates the plethora of other <i>mitzvos</i>
which also serve to deepen the Jew's awareness of <i>yetziyas Mitzrayim</i>,
ranging from <i>chametz</i> and <i>korban Pesach</i> to <i>tefillin</i>, <i>mezuzah</i>,
<i>krias Shema</i>, and <i>sukkah</i>. The Ramban emphasizes that by perceiving
the providence of <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> throughout our national history, we
cultivate an acute awareness of His omnipotent existence and the truth of His
Torah. Our recollection of the unquestionable Divine involvement in the
wondrous miracles of <i>yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> proclaims our steadfast belief
in <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i>. At the same time, however, Ramban adds that our
attention to these "great" miracles should never distract us from
the "minor" miracles which occur constantly throughout our own
lives. On the contrary, a fundamental and inviolable tenet of Jewish belief is
that "From the great miracles, a person comes to admit to the hidden
miracles that are the foundation of the entire Torah. For no one has a portion
in the Torah of Moshe until he believes that all of our words and events are
miracles, and they are not all a product of nature." According to the
Ramban, the daily requirement of <i>zechiras yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> teaches us
the eternal mission of the Jew: to perceive and appreciate the undeniable
presence of the <i>yad Hashem</i> in each and every aspect of life. </p>

<P>The Ramban's notion that miracles exist in both
revealed and concealed forms is evident in the very meaning of the word "<i>neis</i>"
itself. The conventional translation of the term "<i>neis</i>" denotes
a "miracle" or "wonder", as Rashi describes in <i>Shemos</i>
17:16. However, the Torah also employs the very same term to signify a
"banner" or "flag," as seen in <i>Bamidbar</i> 26:10
and <i>Yeshayah</i> 18:3. In light of the Ramban's explanation, these two
definitions are not coincidental. The glorious and overt miracles serve as a
"banner," proclaiming and confirming the miraculous status of the
smaller, "natural" miracles and wonders. Such a relationship is
certainly apparent in the dual miracles of Chanukah. Chanukah celebrates both the
"natural" military victory and the "supernatural" burning
of a small amount of oil for 8 days. The unquestionably supernatural burning of
the oil corroborated the equally miraculous nature of the military victory. </p>

<P>This duality finds particular relevance in our current
season of Adar. The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Megillah</i> 6b) presents a dispute as to
whether the <i>Megillah</i> should optimally read in Adar 1 or Adar 2. Rebbe
Eliezer B'Rebbi Yossi requires that the <i>Megillah</i> be read in the
first Adar, in accordance with the principle <i>"Ain ma'avirin al hamitzvos</i>
- one should not skip over opportunities to fulfill a <i>mitzvah</i>".
Rebbe Shimon Ben Gamiliel, however, defers the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> to
the second Adar, in order to juxtapose one <i>geulah</i> (Purim) to another
(Pesach). His ruling begs the simple question: what is the value of adjoining
the two <i>geulos</i>?</p>

<P>Perhaps Rebbe Shimon Ben Gamiliel's ruling is
precisely rooted in the Ramban's understanding of revealed and concealed
miracles. The Vilna Gaon, in his commentary to <i>Megillas Esther</i> (1:2), emphasizes
that the significance of the holiday of Purim lies in the ostensibly natural
occurrence of supernatural miracles. The salvation was performed in the context
of "<i>hester panim</i>" - concealment of the Divine hand. The
Vilna Gaon cites the well known question of the <i>Gemarah</i> (<i>Chullin</i>
139b): "<i>Esther min haTorah minayin</i>? - Where is Esther alluded to
in the Torah?" The <i>Gemarah</i> cites the verse (<i>Devarim</i> 31)
"<i>V'anochi haster astir panai bayom hahu</i> - And I will
conceal my face on that day." It is precisely this concealment, or
"<i>hester panim,</i>" set in the darkness of the Babylonian exile,
which characterizes the miracle of Purim. The Jewish people's imperilment
and subsequent salvation were orchestrated through entirely "natural"
means, and the name of <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> is not even mentioned in the <i>Megillah</i>.
</p>

<P>In stark contrast, the miracles of Pesach were marked by
drastic deviations from the normal course of nature. From the transformation of
water to blood to the splitting of the sea, the hand of <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu </i>was
unquestionably evident throughout the Exodus; Jews and non-Jews alike were
forced to recognize His insurmountable involvement. In light of the
Ramban's comment, perhaps the juxtaposition of Purim and Pesach serves to
further sensitize the Jew to the miracles of <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i>. Through
the revealed miracles of Pesach, we recognize the equally undeniable
involvement of <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> in the story of Purim. Pesach's open
miracles thus affirm Purim's silent miracles. </p>

<P>May our constant remembrance of <i>yetziyas Mitzrayim</i>,
along with the other annual commemorations of <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i>'s
indescribable wonders, help us to perceive and appreciate the constant miracles
with which <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> blesses us each and every day of our lives.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[The Relationship Between <i>Yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> and <i>Kabbalas Ha'Torah</i>]]></title>

<P>
In linking <i>Chag ha'Pesach</i> to <i>Chag ha'Shavuos</i>,
the days of <i>sefiras ha'omer</i> underscore the fundamental relationship
that exists between <i>yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> and <i>kabbalas ha'Torah</i>.
Indeed, a plethora of <i>Midrashic</i> and Ravnic writings seem to place
particular emphasis on this critical connection. The Ran (<i>Pesachim</i> 28a
in Rif), for example, quotes the <i>Midrash</i>, which traces the current
practice of <i>sefiras ha'Omer</i> back to the original counting done by <i>Bnei
Yisroel</i> in anticipation of <i>kabbalas ha'Torah</i> as they left <i>Mitzrayim</i>.
Similarly, the <i>Sefer ha'Chinuch</i> (306) posits that the counting of
the <i>omer</i> reflects our insatiable yearning for <i>kabbalas ha'Torah</i>,
like a slave counting the days until he is freed. By counting in ascending order
from day one to forty nine, we reflect that our "every longing and
yearning is to arrive at this day." The Ramban (23:36) also stresses this
relationship, explaining that the Torah's reference to <i>Chag ha'Shavuos</i>
as "<i>Atzeres</i>" analogizes the days of <i>sefiras ha'omer</i>
to <i>chol ha'moed</i>, thereby connecting <i>yetzias mitzrayim</i> to <i>kabbalas
ha'Torah</i>. The Ramban adds (Introduction to <i>sefer Shemos</i>) that
the redemption from <i>Mitzrayim</i> of <i>Pesach</i> was incomplete until <i>Bnei
Yisroel</i> received the Torah on <i>Shavuos</i>, as only <i>kabbalas
ha'Torah</i> could return <i>Bnei Yisroel</i> to the exalted status of
their forefathers.</p>

<P>
Furthermore, perhaps one could suggest that the connection between
<i>Pesach</i> and <i>Shavuos</i> may account for the Torah's omission of any
explicit <i>mitzvah</i> of "<i>simcha</i>" on <i>Pesach</i> itself.
While the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>simcha</i> certainly applies to <i>Pesach</i> <i>halachically</i>,
the Torah does not particularly specify so. The conspicuous absence of the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>simcha</i> may suggest that true <i>simcha</i> can only be experienced in
the context of complete freedom, which comes from the <i>kabbalas
ha'Torah</i> of <i>Shavuos</i>. As the <i>mishnah</i> (<i>Avos</i> 6:2)
states, "There is no free man except one who involves himself in the
study of Torah." Thus, the role of <i>sefiras ha'omer</i> in
connecting the <i>Yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> of <i>Pesach</i> to the <i>kabbalas
ha'Torah</i> of <i>Shavuos</i> cannot be overstated.&nbsp; </p>

<P>
This <i>hashkafic</i> role of <i>sefiras ha'omer</i> may
bear <i>halachic</i> ramifications as well. Rav Ovadya Yosef (<i>Yechaveh
Da'as</i> I:24) adduces support for his opinion that one may recite a <i>birchas
shehechiyanu</i> on new items purchased during <i>sefirah</i> from the
Ramban's analogy of <i>sefiras ha'omer</i> to <i>chol ha'moed</i>.
Rav Ovadya explains that although the three weeks between the seventeenth of <i>Tamuz</i>
and the ninth of <i>Av</i> mark a time of collective national tragedy
accompanied by practices of mourning, the period of <i>sefiras ha'omer</i>
is quite different. These days are not considered days of collective misfortune
for the entire nation (although isolated practices of mourning are maintained
in order to commemorate the tragic deaths of the 24,000 students of Rav
Akiva). Rather, the days of <i>sefirah</i> resemble a festive <i>chol
ha'moed</i> between <i>Pesach</i> and <i>Shavuos</i>, and thus <i>birchas
shehechiyanu</i> may certainly be recited.</p>

<P>
The role of <i>sefiras ha'omer</i> as a connection
between <i>Pesach</i> and <i>Shavuos</i> may also be <i>halachically</i>
significant in explaining the status of <i>sefirah bizman ha'zeh</i>. Many
<i>rishonim</i> assume that in the absence of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, <i>sefiras
ha'omer</i> is mandated only <i>mid'rabanan</i> (see <i>Tosafos
Menachos</i> 66a s.v. "<i>Zecher</i>," Rosh and Ran at end of <i>maseches
Pesachim</i>). Their rationale may be based on the Torah's apparent
linkage of the <i>korban omer</i> to the counting of the <i>omer</i> within the
same <i>pasuk</i> (<i>Vayikra</i> 23:15): "And you shall count for
yourselves, from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day you bring the waved
<i>omer</i> offering, seven complete weeks&#8230;" This juxtaposition suggests
a relationship between the <i>korban</i> and the counting, implying that if the
<i>korban omer</i> can no longer be offered, counting the <i>omer</i> must also
be inapplicable<i> Mid'oraisa</i>. The Rambam, however, maintains that <i>sefiras
ha'omer</i> always remains a Biblical obligation, unequivocally stating
that the <i>mitzvah</i> applies "to every man of Israel, in
every place and every time" (<i>Hilchos. Temidin U'Musafin</i>
7:22-24). The <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i> (489:3) explains that the Rambam's opinion
is rooted in his understanding of the <i>hashkafic</i> relationship between <i>Pesach</i>
and <i>Shavuos</i>. Even if the <i>korban omer</i> is no longer brought in our
times, <i>sefiras ha'omer</i> must still be performed Mid'oraisa in
order to symbolize our ardent anticipation of <i>kabbalas ha'Torah</i> -
a sentiment which is as relevant after the <i>churban</i> as it was before. The
<i>Aruch HaShulchan</i> adds that the <i>korban</i> <i>omer</i> itself further
reflects this relationship. Brought from barley, the fodder of animals, the <i>korban</i>
<i>omer</i> symbolizes man's animal-like status when he is without Torah.
Only upon receiving the Torah on <i>Shavuos</i> may the wheat flour <i>shtei
ha'lechem</i> be brought, thereby symbolizing man's elevated status
above the animal world. </p>

<P>
The <i>hashkafic</i> significance of <i>sefiras
ha'omer</i> may also account for the lack of a <i>birchas shehechiyanu</i>
on the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>sefirah</i>. The <i>Ba'al HaMaor</i> (<i>Pesachim</i>
28a in Rif) attributes the absence of <i>shehechiyanu</i> to the fact that <i>shehechiyanu</i> is recited
only on <i>mitzvos</i> which produce some type of benefit or joy. <i>Sefiras
ha'omer</i>, however, is a source of distress, calling to mind doleful
memories of the destruction of the holy <i>Mikdash</i>. The Meiri (<i>Pesachim</i>
7b) adopts a different approach, explaining that the <i>birchas shehechiyanu</i>
recited on the first night of Pesach actually covers the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>sefiras
ha'omer</i>. Rabbeinu Yerucham (<i>Nesiv</i> 4, <i>Chelek</i> 5),
however, suggests almost the opposite possibility: the <i>birchas shehechiyanu</i>
of <i>Shavuos</i> retroactively covers the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>sefiras
ha'omer</i>. Perhaps Rabbeinu Yerucham's explanation may relate to
the aforementioned relationship between <i>Pesach</i> and <i>Shavuos</i>. While
most <i>mitzvos</i> require a <i>birchas shehechiyanu</i> prior to the
performance of the <i>mitzvah</i>, <i>sefiras ha'omer</i> is quite different.
Since the purpose of <i>sefiras ha'omer</i> is to bring <i>Bnei Yisroel</i>
from the incomplete redemption of <i>Pesach</i> to the <i>kabbalas
ha'Torah</i> of <i>Shavuos</i>, <i>sefirah</i> does not constitute an end
unto itself. Rather, it is a means towards the desired end of <i>Shavuos</i>. Thus
the <i>birchas shehechiyanu</i> of <i>Shavuos</i>, which marks the culmination
and goal of the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>sefirah</i>, may retroactively apply to
the <i>sefirah</i> as well, despite the general preference for reciting a <i>shehechiyanu</i>
before the performance of a <i>mitzvah</i>. </p>

<P>
One other explanation for the lack of a <i>birchas shehechiyanu</i>
on the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>sefirah</i> is suggested by the Levush. Like the
aforementioned <i>rishonim</i>, the Levush (<i>Hilchos Pesach</i> 489)
emphasizes <i>sefirah's</i> role as a connector between <i>Pesach</i> and
<i>Shavuos</i>. The Levush explains that <i>sefirah</i> is counted "like
a man expecting and waiting for a particular day upon which he will receive a
great gift or other item which will bring joy to his heart." In
expressing one's unbridled anticipation for <i>kabbalas ha'Torah</i>,
one demonstrates that receiving the Torah is of greater value than the physical
redemption from Egypt. Hence, argues the Levush, if
the entire purpose of <i>sefirah</i> is to direct one's gaze away from
the present towards the anticipated ends of <i>kabbalas ha'Torah</i>, how
could one possibly make a blessing on the present <i>zman</i>? Because <i>Bnei
Yisroel</i> hope to pass through the period of <i>sefirah</i> as rapidly as
possible in order to reach the period of <i>Shavuos</i>, no <i>birchas shehechiyanu</i>
is recited.</p>

<P>
The physical freedom from <i>Mitzrayim</i> is thus incomplete
without the spiritual freedom engendered by <i>kabbalas ha'Torah</i>. While
physical redemption bears the simulacrum of freedom, true redemption can only
be attained through Talmud Torah and <i>yiras Shamayim</i>. <i>Ye'hi ratzon</i>
that we should merit to continue to learn and exert ourselves constantly in <i>talmud
Torah</i>, so that we will greet <i>Mashiach tzidkeinu bimheira b'yameinu</i>.

<P align="center">I</p>

<P>There is a cryptic <i>Gemara Bechoros</i> (8B) that relates
that Athenians brought two eggs to Rav Yehoshua and said to him: "Tell us
which of the two is the egg of a black hen and which is of a white hen."
In response, he brought them two cheeses, and asked them: "Which is of
the milk of a black goat and which is of a white goat?" The Maharal
understands this challenging piece of <i>Aggadah</i> that the non-Jewish
philosophers were asserting that the egg is the "child" of the
chicken and should inherit some of its mother's traits. Thus they were
claiming that progeny do not always resemble their ancestors, and therefore the
Jews, despite their descent from wise and virtuous patriarchs, are no better
that anyone else. </p>

<P>Rav Yehoshua countered that eggs are more like milk or
cheese rather than the living tissue of birds and animals. Eggs and cheese are
secretions rather than offspring and therefore, need not resemble their
"parent". Rav Yehoshua maintained his stance that Jews come from
special stock. </p>

<P>The Maharsha in his <i>Chidushei Aggados</i> to this <i>Gemara</i>
explains that each hen symbolizes 21 days in the year, as the <i>Gemara</i>
above (8A) taught that a chicken embryo gestates for 21 days. The black hen is
the sad period of mourning from the <i>17th of Tammuz</i> to the <i>9th
of Av</i>, and the white hen is symbolic of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> through <i>Hoshanah
Rabbah</i>, a joyful time of atonement. The hens bear eggs namely, events that
transpire during each of these periods. The Athenians were charging -
it's all the same- the eggs are alike, there is no difference between
periods of joy and that of tragedy, one day follows another with no relief in
sight to your exile and plight. </p>

<P>Rav Yehoshua countered by bringing 2 cheeses, each from the
milk of a different goat. The goats represent the 2 goats of the Yom Kippur
service. The white is the goat sacrificed to Hashem, and the black is one sent
to <i>Azazel</i> (scapegoat). Despite their outer appearances and ultimate
divergent destinations, both goats produce white cheese, they both atone for
the sins of the Jewish nation. Both hens as well lay identical eggs, not dark
eggs of pain and sorrow, but white eggs of forgiveness and hope. As the 21 days
of <i>Tishrei</i> bring atonement and closeness to Hashem, so do the 21 days of
<i>Bein HaMetzarim</i> bring atonement and closeness to Hashem. </p>

<P>Parshas Devorim</i> is
always read on the <i>Shabbos</i> prior to <i>Tisha B'Av</i>. It thus
behooves us to reflect upon the following. At first glance there is a strong
similarity between these apparently different three weeks, namely both call
upon the Jew to shed his artificial insulation and focus on the stark reality
at hand. It is too easy to become distracted from G-d - Israel - Torah
- community - <i>chessed</i> and to get immersed in daily needs and
survival. Therefore, these 2 periods of three weeks serve as a rude awakening
to help the Jewish people focus and prioritize. </p>

<P> 
As we approach <i>Tisha B'Av</i> the restrictions
against eating meat, swimming, and buying new clothes are to strip us of some
of the distractions that prevent our feeling the plight of others and indeed
ourselves. It is interesting to note the formula that Ashkenazic Jewry uses to
comfort a mourner. The Sephardic community says it like it is: "<i>Terachu
min ha Shamayim</i>"- Hashem should console you. The Ashkenazic version
adds; "<i>Besoch she'ar avlei Tzion v' Yerushalayim</i>".
Why do we integrate <i>aveilus yeshana</i>- an old state of mourning that we
have been observing for almost two thousand years with <i>aveilus chadasha</i>,
the immediate current loss of a family member. </p>



<P> 
One possibility is to include the individual mourner with
the community and nation of Israel, as we are all mourners. As we
find in <i>Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah</i> (335:6): The primary fulfillment of <i>Bikur
Cholim</i>, visiting and attending to the sick is to pray for the invalid. The MecHaber
teaches that the appropriate is to include the individual <i>besoch cholei Yisrael</i>,
among the other sick of Israel. The Shach explains that by
including him among the rest of the nation that need a <i>refuah</i>, his
prayer is upgraded. Similarly, we include the mourner in his personal state of
mourning together with the rest of Israel who are mourning for the Temple and Jerusalem, and
thus <i>zechus haRavm</i>, the merit of the masses should assist him. </p>

<P> 
Additionally, noted the Rav zt"l, we know that Hashem
will comfort the mourners of Zion. Our holy literature and the <i>haftoros</i>
of <i>Zayin D'Nechemta</i> (7 <i>Shabbosim </i>that follow <i>Tisha B'Av</i>
until <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>) are replete with this theme. Nowhere are we assured
of His comforting the individual mourner. We therefore include the individual
and pray for the coattail effect. </p>


<P> 
A second explanation for our connecting the personal loss
with the national mourning may be gleaned from the <i>Medrash</i> (<i>P'Sicha
Eicha Rabbah</i> 25) which relates that Rabban Gamliel had a neighbor who tragically
lost a young child. Each night the mother would cry and the cries awoke the
great Torah sage who in turn mourned for the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. The story
continues that to preserve the health of the <i>Rav</i>, she moved. The
question emerges: Why did he cry for the <i>Churban,</i> not for her? The
answer is that all tragedies that we experience emanate from <i>Churban HaBayis</i>.&nbsp;
The destruction of the Temple brought about <i>Hester Panim</i>-
a diminution of His Presence, Glory and Providence. Her
tragedy and countless others are a manifestation of the <i>Churban HaBayis</i>.
It is thus understandable that we link the person's individual loss with
that of the nation. </p>

<P> 
A third explanation may be based on <i>Koheles</i> (7:2):
"It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting
(for that is the end of man) and the living should take it to heart." At
first glance the last charge of the verse is to learn the lessons of life, as
they are taught in a house of mourning- to prioritize one's goals and
aspirations. The <i>Medrash Koheles Rabbah</i> (7:9) understands it in the
following way: Do a kindness so that one will be done to you. Specifically
noted: attend a funeral so that people should attend your funeral, mourn for
others so that others should mourn for you, act benevolently so that
benevolence should be done to you. I'd humbly add recognize and identify
with the personal loss of the next one, so that you should realize that <u>you</u>
too are a mourner. We are so comfortable in the exile, we do not even realize
that this is not the norm for the Jewish nation. We fail too often to learn
from the <i>nichum aveilus</i> experience. Thus, while we believed we came to
give comfort and consolation to the next one sitting on a low chair, in reality
we have come to enhance ourselves, by noting and confronting our national
mourning. The moment we internalize "<i>besoch shear avlei Zion</i> <i>v'Yerushalayim</i>
"
<u>our</u> life assumes a different focus. Our <i>tefillos</i> are different.
We then focus on <i>shechinta b'galusa</i>- how G-d's presence is
hidden from mankind, a whole different perspective on life, where is home to
the Jew, and other basic issues that our hectic schedules preclude us from
addressing. Just as one's visit to the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> was <i>lir'os
u lay'ra'os</i>- to see and be seen (Chagigah 2A), similarly, our
extending consolation to an <i>aveilus chadasha</i> awakens within us our <i>aveilus
yeshana</i>. </p>


<P align="center">III</p>

<P> 
Upon reflection there are some very stark contrasts between
the personal and communal or national mourning. Regarding the former there are
restrictions; one may not over-mourn. The period of <i>shiva</i> is over on the
morning of the 7th day, and for one to extend their observance of <i>shiva</i>
till sunset would be a violation of Jewish Law. Just so mush was granted to <i>aveilus
chadasha</i>. Moreover, if one ceases his personal mourning on the eve of a
holiday, he goes immediately from <i>shiva</i> to the <i>sukkah, zman simchaseinu</i>,
to the <i>Seder</i> and celebrates. We reason and explain how he is to curtail
and immediately redirect his emotions. Incredible resiliency is expected and
demanded of him. In sharp contrast there is no limit to the mourning for the <i>Beis
HaMikdash</i>. The Jewish people are not told to be forgetful, move on, to
accept our fate. In fact we insist that nothing less than <i>Mashiach </i>will
ultimately solve our national problems and turmoil, and by maintaining this
faith and realization comfort the mourner that his ultimate consolation is
inextricably bound to that of his nation. "<i>Besoch shear avlei</i> <i>Zion</i> <i>v'Yerushalayim</i>
"
awakens not only within us our belief in the 12th and 13th
Principles of Faith as articulated by the Rambam (coming of <i>Mashiach</i> and
Resurrection of the Dead), but within the recipient of our consolation as well.</p>

<P> 
I pray we will all be busy with happy occasions, but when
necessary may the above insights enhance our mitzvah of <i>nichum avelim</i>,
and focus on our being <i>avlei Zion v'Yerushalayim</i>,
preparing us for a more meaningful<i> Ellul</i> and 21 joyful days of
atonement. </p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: shavuos]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[


<P>The Gemara (<i>Shabbos</i> 88b) teaches in the name of R' Yehoshua
ben Levi, "with every single statement that emanated from the mouth of
the Holy One at Sinai the souls of the Jewish people departed from their
bodies, as it is stated (<i>Shir Hashirim</i> 5:6), "My soul departed as
He spoke". How did they receive the subsequent statements? Hashem brought
down the dew with which he will resurrect he dead in the future and He
resurrected them, as found in Tehillim (68:10).</p>



<P>I believe there are two profound lessons contained in this
metaphysical teaching. The first is that Torah living engenders a different
quality of life. To receive the Torah (aside from the physical preparations
found in <i>Shemos</i> 19) they had to undergo a spiritual transformation; they
could not be the same people that arrived at <i>Har Sinai</i>. The Zohar
teaches that Hashem, His nation Israel, and His Torah are one. Thus, experiencing
the prophecy of His Torah was a transformative infusion of Godliness. This is
also indicated by the Talmud's (<i>Shabbos</i> 105a) understanding of the
opening word of the Decalogue, "<i>anochi</i>", to be (in addition
to its literal meaning) an acronym for "<i>ana nafshi ksivsa yehivas</i>",
meaning that Hashem not only transmitted commandments to the Jewish nation, but
gave part of His soul to them. As part of the <i>dayeinu</i> we praise Hashem
not only for the content and teachings of Torah but also for bringing us to <i>Har
Sinai</i> per se and inducing this transformation.</p>



<P>The Talmud <i>(Shabbos</i> 146a) further emphasizes this
spiritual metamorphosis by stating that at Sinai "<i>paska zuhamasan</i>
- they were purified", enabling them to receive their Sinaiitic
souls. The Kuzari expresses this idea by stating there are five strata of
beings - the inanimate, plant life, animals, man and Israel. The difference
between each stratum is dramatic, including the difference between Israel,
imbued with this Sinaniitic soul, and the rest of society. Being on this higher
stratum enables us to imbibe Torah into our lives.</p>



<P>R' Eliyahu Lopian <i>zt"l</i> in his introduction to <i>Sefer
Shemos</i> writes that the charge leveled by our enemies over the centuries
that the Jew is too rich and successful is provoked by a <i>middah</i> that Hashem
implanted in our nature: "One who loves money will never be satisfied
with money" (<i>Koheles</i> 5:9); "If one has one hundred (units of
money), he wants two hundred". This is understood by <i>Chazal</i> in a
spiritual sense, that the Jewish <i>neshama</i> is drawn to the infinite. If
this trait is not channeled positively towards spirituality, he will apply it
to this-worldly affairs.</p>



<P>The second lesson that emanates from the resurrection at
Sinai is the exciting concept of "<i>marbeh Torah marbeh chaim</i>
- an increase in Torah increases life" (<i>Avos</i> 2:8). Why, one
may ask, did the Jews' elevated souls depart after each commandment,
necessitating a further act of resuscitation? Perhaps to teach future
generations that although they attained one level of Torah and spirituality,
they are still "lifeless" compared to the next level, and require
Divine assistance to climb higher. "Saw you at Sinai" is not only a
clever phrase to introduce/reconnect two singles, but the fact that all Jewish
souls were present at Sinai means we each experienced this repeated revival.
This experience not only enables us to constantly improve our quality of life,
but also to become a fundamentally different person through increasing our
Torah learning and observance of <i>miztvos</i>.</p>



<P>This concept emerges from a fascinating detail regarding the
accidental murderer. The Torah teaches, "he shall flee to one of these
(cities of refuge) and live" (4:42). The Talmud (<i>Makkos</i> 10a) rules
that if a student establishes residence in a city of refuge his teacher must
visit him regularly to maintain the <i>rebbe</i>-<i>talmid</i> relationship, as
the Torah mandates "and he shall live", i.e. we must provide him
with arrangements to be able to live. The Rambam (<i>Hilchos Rotzeach</i> 7:1)
codifies this law stating that life without the study of Torah is akin to
death. Given that the permanent residents of the cities of refuge were the Levi'im,
whose role is to "teach Your ordinances to Yaakov and Your Torah to
Israel" (<i>Devarim</i> 33:10), and thus there certainly was Torah and a
Torah environment in the city of refuge, why do we specifically require that <u>his</u>
teacher tRavel to the city of refuge to teach him Torah? Because without <u>his</u>&nbsp;teacher,
the one that can inspire him and raise him as no one else can, he will not
reach the same level of spirituality, and the absence of that achievement is
called "lifelessness" by the Torah.</p>



<P>This is further substantiated by a fascinating dialog
between R' Tarfon and R' Akiva (<i>Kiddushin</i> 6b). After a lengthy debate
over a particular intriguing <i>halacha</i>, R' Tarfon concedes to the opinion
of R' Akiva. When he took leave of him he said, "Akiva! Whoever separates
himself from you it is as if he separated from life itself!"</p>



<P>The exciting teaching of the resurrection of the Jewish
nation at <i>Har</i> Sinai gives new meaning to the prayer of <i>Ahavas Olam</i>
(recited every night before reciting <i>Shema Yisroel</i>). There it states,
"<i>ki heim chayeinu</i> - for they (Torah) are our life".
This is to say that not only does Torah validate the Kuzari's designation of Israel
as a class unto itself, but within the Jewish nation Torah gives each
individual a daily opportunity to renew and upgrade their lease on life.</p>

<P>
"You shall dwell in booths for a seven day period, every
native in Israel shall dwell in booths so that your generations will know that
I caused the Children of Israel to dwell in booths when I took them from the
land of Egypt; I am Hashem, your G-d"(<i>Vayikra</i> 23:42-43). Rashi,
citing from the <i>Gemarah Sukkah</i> (11B) understands the above in accordance
with the teaching of Rav Eliezer, that <i>Sukkahs</i> are the annual
commemoration of the <i>ananei hakavod</i>- Clouds of Glory in which Hashem
enveloped the Jewish nation during their forty year trek in the desert. The
"climate control" setting of these clouds provided air conditioning
during the day and heat at night. It is no wonder we celebrate Hashem's
Divine providence and protection. Yet one has to ask, given that the three
shepherds that led the Jewish nation, Moshe, Aharon and Miriam, each
contributed a major phenomenon - Moshe the <i>mon</i>, Miriam the <i>be'er</i>
and Aharon the <i>ananei hakavod</i> - why do we have a <i>yom tov</i> to
commemorate Aharon's gift while the other two are seemingly neglected?</p>

<P>
An answer to the above may be culled from the commentary of the Gra
(Vilna <i>Gaon</i>) on the opening verses of <i>Shir HaShirim</i>, and his
commentary <i>Aderes</i> Eliyahu on <i>Shmos</i> (34:10). The Tur (<i>Orach Chaim</i>
625) writes that <i>Sukkos</i> is observed at the time when people are
returning to their homes after the Summer to clearly indicate that our exiting
our homes is for the sake of the <i>mitzvah</i> as opposed to our personal
comfort. The <i>Gaon</i> provides another reason why <i>Sukkos</i> is celebrated
in the Fall and not in the Spring when we left Egypt. The Gra
opines that since the <i>yom tov</i> of <i>Sukkos</i> is to remember Hashem's
protective clouds, the Jewish nation were first introduced to the clouds
immediately after the exodus, as the Torah (<i>Shmos</i> 13:21) informs us:
"Hashem went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them on the
way". Why then do we not celebrate <i>Sukkos</i> in the Spring? We should
conduct the <i>Pesach Seder</i> in the <i>Sukkah.</i> </p>

<P>
The Gra answers that when <i>Bnei Yisroel</i> committed the sin
of the golden calf (on the 17th of <i>Tammuz)</i> Hashem withdrew the clouds
and His apparent benevolent protection from the people. It was only after Hashem
pronounced <i>"Solachti kidvorecha"</i> (<i>Bamidbar</i> 14:20) on <i>Yom
Kippur</i>, and after the people responded enthusiastically and generously with
their wealth and willingness to the commandment to construct the <i>Mishkan</i>,
that the clouds return. </p>

<P>
What happened subsequently is most remarkable. The clouds did
not only return, but they were of much greater magnitude. Whereas prior to the
sin of the golden calf the clouds enveloped only the righteous members of the
nation, they now provided TLC to all. This is how the Gra understands the
verses immediately following the Thirteen Attributes of Hashem, and His
forgiveness of the Jewish people for the sin of the golden calf. Hashem said:
"Behold! I seal a covenant before your entire people I shall make
distinctions (wonders) such as have never been created in the entire world and
among the nations, and the entire people among whom you are will see the work
of Hashem- which is awesome- that I am about to do with you." (<i>Shemos</i>
34:10)</p>

<P>
The wonders that the verse is referring to are the clouds that
returned enveloping the entire nation. It is for this reason that <i>Sukkos</i>
is celebrated in the Fall, as we are reliving the experience of the second set
of <i>Ananei HaKavod</i> that appeared in the Fall, following <i>Yom Kippur</i>,
not the first set that arrived in the Spring. </p>

<P>
A most exciting phenomenon emerges: The Jewish nation backslid
and sinned: they commit the gRave sin of the golden calf, and then Moshe leads
the nation in <i>Teshuvah</i>. Had Hashem restored the relationship to its
prior state before their sin, that would have been <i>dayeinu </i>- sufficient.
We would have celebrated the return of the <i>Shechinah</i>, Divine Presence.
What happened was the extraordinary! The relationship between Hashem and the
people was not only restored, but improved and enhanced. </p>

<P>
The fact that <i>Sukkos</i> follows <i>Yom Kippur</i> is not
accidental, nor coincidental, but is rather the actualization of one of the
basic tenets of <i>Yom Kippur</i>. The latter not only has the capacity to
atone, but as Reish Lakish teaches (<i>Yuma</i> 86B): <i>Teshuvah
</i>that is performed <i>b'ahavah</i>, motivated by love of Hashem, has
the ability to transform willful transgressions into merits! Thus <i>Sukkos</i>
serves as an annual symbol and testimony of not only our renewed relationship
with Hashem, but our improved one. </p>

<P>
It is thus understandable why <i>Sukkos </i>enjoys the
distinction of being the happiest <i>Chag</i>. Its very reference and identification
in the prayers is <i>Zman Simchaseinu</i>. Moreover, every morning in the <i>bracha</i>
prior to <i>Shema</i>, we proclaim "<i>Ahava rabbah ahavtanu</i> - with
abundant love Hashem has loved us". The proof of that love is the next
verse - &nbsp;"<i>chemlah gedolah v'yesara chamalta oleinu</i> - with
exceedingly great pity have You pitied us". The Gra explains that this
line refers to the great reversal that took place after the Golden Calf.
Initially, Hashem says to Moshe, "I will destroy them and make a nation
from you." After Moshe's prayers and the nation's <i>Teshuvah</i>,
Hashem not only forgives, but extends His Divine Presence that was at Sinai for
a brief period to dwell permanently in their midst in the <i>Mishkan</i>. Not a
return of <i>Shechinah</i>, but an upgrade. </p>

<P>
Finally, it is understandable why we have a holiday to celebrate
Aharon's contribution of the Clouds more than Miriam's well and
Moshe's <i>mon</i>. The latter two were necessities. Hashem brought them
into a desert, and thus He had to provide them with the basics of nourishment.
But an improved all-weather comfort system for the entire nation that showed a
special love and affection, that we excitedly reciprocate and return on <i>Sukkos.</i></p>

<P>
While the mitzvah of "<i>zechiras Yetziyas Mitzrayim</i>,"
remembering the Exodus, occupies an undeniably profound place in Jewish
consciousness, the source of this obligation is subject to considerable debate.</p>

<P>
In identifying the source for the daily obligation to
commemorate <i>Yetziyas Mitzrayim</i>, Rashi (<i>Shemos</i> 13:3) quotes the
Mechilta on the <i>pasuk</i> "<i>Zachor es hayom hazeh asher yatzasem
miMitzrayim mibeis avadim</i>." In <i>Berachos</i> 21a (s.v. <i>Emes</i>),
however, Rashi cites an entirely different source for this obligation: "<i>l'maa'n
tizkor es yom tzaischa me'eretz Mitzrayim kol yemei chayecha</i>" (<i>Devarim</i>
16:3). Apparently, Rashi maintains that both verses are necessary to understand
the scope of this mitzvah. Had the Torah merely commanded "<i>zachor es
hayom hazeh</i>," one may have erroneously concluded that the mitzvah
applies only during Pesach (see the continuation of <i>Shemos</i> 13:3). The <i>pasuk</i>
in <i>Devarim</i> thus dispels such a notion, teaching that the obligation
exists "<i>kol yemei chayecha</i>" - every day of one's
life. Conversely, had the Torah merely presented the <i>pasuk</i> in <i>Devarim</i>,
"<i>l'ma'an tizkor</i>&#8230;," one may have
erroneously read the <i>pasuk</i> as teaching the reason for the Pesach
obligation, but not necessarily enjoining, by force of a Biblical positive
commandment, to actively remember the Exodus itself. Hence, according to Rashi,
both verses in <i>Shemos</i> and <i>Devarim</i> are essential in conveying the
Biblical requirement for daily remembrance.</p>

<P>
Interestingly, however, the Rambam makes no mention of a
requirement to remember <i>yetziyas Mitzrayim</i>. In light of this conspicuous
omission, the Ohr Sameach (<i>Hilhos Kriyas Shema</i> 1:1) goes as far as to
suggest that the Rambam understands the daily obligation as being only Ravnic
in nature. Rav Soloveitchik <i>zt"l</i> (<i>Shiurim L'Zecher Abba
Mori</i> vol. I: <i>Mitzvas Kriyas Shema u'Zechiras Yetzias Mitzrayim</i>,
page 1), however, explained the Rambam's omission of this mitzvah in a
different manner<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>.
Quoting his grandfather Reb Chayim <i>zt"l</i>, the Rav explained that in
the Rambam's eyes, <i>zechiras yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> does indeed
constitute a Biblical mitzvah. The Rambam merely refrained from counting it as
one of the canonical 613 <i>mitzvos</i> for technical reasons. The Rambam
himself writes (<i>Shoresh</i> 3 of <i>Sefer Hamitzvos</i>) that only <i>mitzvos</i>
which are eternally binding, "<i>mitzvos l'doros</i>," are
reckoned amongst the 613. In the Rambam's eyes, however, the mitzvah of <i>zechiras
yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> is temporary in nature. Citing the <i>Mishnaic</i>
dispute (<i>Berachos</i> 12b) between Ben Zoma and the <i>chachamim</i> as to
whether the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>zechiras yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> will exist in
the Messianic era, Reb Chayim explained that the Rambam rules in accordance
with Ben Zoma, that the mitzvah will cease to exist. As such, the obligation to
remember <i>yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> does not constitute a "<i>mitzvah
l'doros</i>." Thus, while the mitzvah is undeniably Biblical in
nature, it is nonetheless technically omitted from the list of 613<a
href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a>. </p>

<P>
While Reb Chayim suggested that the Rambam omitted <i>zechiras
yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> because he assumes like Ben Zoma, that the mitzvah is
only temporary in nature, Reb Issur Zalman Meltzer (Even HaEzel, <i>Hilchos
Kriyas Shemah</i>, 1:3) questions this very assumption. Reb Issur Zalman
maintains that even Ben Zoma, who appears to reject the existence of this <i>mitzvah</i>
in the Messianic era, does not reject its existence categorically. Rather, Ben
Zoma sees <i>zechiras yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> as part of a broader, more general
requirement to commemorate the miraculous redemptions which <i>Hakadosh Baruch
Hu</i> performs throughout the generations. This mitzvah remains eternally
binding, even in Messianic times. Ben Zoma merely argues regarding the specific
details within this broader <i>mitzvah</i>, maintaining that the miracles of
the Messianic era will take the place of the Egyptian exodus. In its core
essence, however, the <i>mitzvah</i> to remember <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu's</i>
redemptive miracles remains unaltered. </p>

<P>
Reb Issur Zalman's argument finds its roots in the
words of the Rashba (<i>Perushei HaHagados</i>, <i>Berachos</i> 12b) and the
Ramban (<i>Shemos</i> 12:2). Both Rishonim seem to decentralize the requirement
to remember <i>yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> from the specific event of <i>yetziyas
Mitzrayim</i>, perceiving it as a much broader obligation to constantly
appreciate the wondrous miracles which <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i> performs on
behalf of <i>Bnei Yisrael</i>. &nbsp;Thus, when <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i>
redeemed the Jewish nation from Bavel, the mitzvah of <i>zechiras yetziyas
Mitzrayim</i> necessitated national thanksgiving and commemoration of the
Babylonian redemption as well<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a>.
Similarly, the future redemption, which will bring new miracles and triumphs,
will necessitate new expressions of praise.</p>

<P>
While the Ramban and the Rashba focus on the overt and
manifest miracles which have occurred at specific historical episodes, the
Ramban (<i>Shemos</i> 13:16) concludes the <i>parsha</i>
by affirming that our attention to these "great" miracles should
never distract us from the "minor" miracles which occur constantly
throughout our lives. To the contrary, a fundamental and inviolable tenet of
Jewish belief is that "From the great miracles, a person comes to admit
to the hidden miracles that are the foundation of the entire Torah. For no one
has a portion in the Torah of Moshe until he believes that all of our words and
events are miracles, and there is no such thing as nature." According to
the Ramban, the daily requirement of <i>zechiras yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> teaches
us the eternal mission of the Jew: to perceive and appreciate the undeniable
presence of the <i>Yad Hashem</i> in each and every aspect of his life. </p>

<p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a>See also "Chazon
Yechezkel" (<i>Berachos</i> 1), who suggests a similar possibility.</p>

<p><a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[2]</a>See
there for an alternate possibility. Namely, that the Rambam does not count <i>zechiras
yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> because he views the <i>mitzvah</i> as part of the
larger <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>Kriyas Shema</i> (<i>kabalas ol malchus Shamayim</i>).

<P>
The <i>Gemarah</i> (<i>Berachos</i> 7a) teaches: "Every statement
uttered by <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> in a person's favor, even if formulated on
a particular condition, will not be rescinded." In citing this <i>Gemarah</i>,
the Rambam notes (Introduction to the <i>Perush HaMishnayos</i>) that it appears
to contradict an earlier <i>Gemarah</i> in the very same <i>Masechta</i>. On
4a, the <i>Gemarah</i> relates that, despite Hashem's unqualified promise of
protection to Yaakov <i>Avinu</i>, Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> nonetheless feared for
his life, "<i>shema yigrom hacheit</i>" - lest a sin result in the revocation
of the promise. The Rambam thus questions: if <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> will
never rescind a favorable promise, why did Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> fear for his
life? </p>

<P>
The Rambam resolves this apparent contradiction by distinguishing
between two types of divine promises. While <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> will
never rescind a promise which He conveys to an individual through an
intermediary prophet, promises which Hashem makes directly with an individual
are indeed subject to reversal. Hence, because Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> received the
promise directly from <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i>, he justifiably feared the
possibility that his misdeeds might result in revocation of the promise. </p>

<P>
The <i>Meshech Chochmah</i> (<i>Bereishis</i> 18:13) utilizes the Rambam's
distinction to explain <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu's</i> apparent disapproval of
Sarah <i>Imeinu's</i> laughter in last week's <i>parsha</i>. Although Avraham <i>Avinu</i>
similarly laughed upon hearing the promise of Yitzchak's birth, Avraham <i>Avinu</i>
received the promise directly from Hashem. Because any promise heard directly
from <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> is subject to reversal, Avraham <i>Avinu's</i>
apparent doubt of the promise's fulfillment was justifiable. Sarah <i>Imeinu</i>,
however, heard Hashem's promise from Avraham <i>Avinu</i>, who held the status
of a prophet. Because any positive promise conveyed through a prophet will
never be rescinded, <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> reprimanded Sarah <i>Imeinu</i>
for her doubt. </p>

<P>
While the Rambam's distinction accounts for <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu's</i>
response to Sarah's laughter, the <i>Chessed L'Avraham</i> (<i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>
ch. 7) notes that the Rambam's aforementioned distinction appears to contradict
the Rambam's own comments in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>. In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>
(ch. 7), the Rambam delineates the requisite qualities for receiving prophecy. The
Rambam emphasizes that a prophet need not exhibit complete perfection of
character, as <i>Tanach</i> relates the shortcomings of numerous prophets,
including Shlomo <i>HaMelech's</i> many wives, Shmuel <i>HaNavi's</i>
trepidation towards Shaul, and Yaakov <i>Avinu's</i> fear of meeting Esav. The <i>Chessed
L'Avraham</i> questions the Rambam's inclusion of Yaakov <i>Avinu's</i> fear as
a "shortcoming." If the Rambam maintains that the promise of <i>HaKadosh Baruch
Hu</i> to Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> was subject to reversal (since it did not employ
a prophetic intermediary), Yaakov Avinu's fear of Esav was certainly justified:
"<i>shema yigrom hacheit</i>". If so, why would this realistic fear be considered
a "shortcoming?"</p>

<P>
R' Elchanan Wasserman (sefer <i>Kovetz He'oros s'eef</i> 5) explains the
Rambam in light of the Vilna Gaon's understanding of the <i>possuk</i>: "<i>byir'as
Hashem mivatach oz u'l'vanav yihye machse</i> - In the fear of Hashem is a
powerful stronghold, and for his children it will be a shelter" (<i>Mishlei</i>
14:26). The Gaon explains that this <i>possuk</i> alludes to two different
forms of belief in <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i>. "<i>Bitochon</i> - trust" -
refers to a person's faith that <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> will fulfill that
which He promises. "<i>Chisoyon</i> - Taking refuge" - refers to a person's
placing his trust in Hashem to provide even that which He has not promised. The
Gaon adds that the notion of "<i>chisoyon</i>" accounts for the numerous comparisons
between <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> and a rock ("<i>tzur</i>") throughout <i>Tanach</i>.
Just as man knows that a rock will unconditionally provide shelter from rain
and harmful elements, despite the fact that the rock never "promised" him to do
so, man can place his complete trust in <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> to provide
all of his needs, even those which have never been promised.</p>

<P>
R' Elchanan employs the Gaon's explanation to resolve the apparent
contradiction in the Rambam. From a pragmatic perspective, Yaakov <i>Avinu's</i>
questioning was certainly understandable, as a promise made without a prophetic
intermediary is subject to the limitation of "<i>shema yigrom hacheit</i>". Rather,
the Rambam's apparent critique of Yaakov <i>Avinu's</i> actions relates to the
trait of "<i>chisoyon</i>" which mandates unwavering trust in <i>HaKadosh
Baruch Hu's</i> assistance, independent of any accompanying promises or
guarantees. Even if a subsequent sin would entirely abrogate the original
promise, Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> should have maintained "<i>chisoyon</i>" in <i>HaKadosh
Baruch Hu's</i> continued protection in the absence of any promises. Therefore,
explains R' Elchanan, the Rambam lists Yaakov <i>Avinu's</i> fear as a "shortcoming."
</p>

<P>
R' Elchanan's analysis underscores the paramount importance of
maintaining not only "<i>bitochon</i>", but also "<i>chisoyon</i>" in the
assistance of Hashem in all of our endeavors. May our unwavering "<i>bitochon</i>"
and "<i>chisoyon</i>" in the salvation of <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> merit a
speedy redemption in our time.</p>

<P>In describing the obligation of <i>sippur
yetziyas Mitzrayim</i>, the <i>Gemarah</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 116b) mandates that
one recite the paragraph of "<i>Arami Oved Avi</i>," generally
recited upon the delivery of the <i>bikkurim</i> to <i>Yerushalayim</i>. The <i>rishonim</i>
and <i>achronim</i> have long dealt with the question of why the <i>parsha</i>
of <i>bikkurim</i> was incorporated into the mitzvah of <i>sippur yetziyas Mitzrayim</i>.
The Ohr Sameach (<i>Hilchos Chametz U'Matzah</i> 7:4) adopts a linguistic
approach: the <i>Gemarah</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 36) derives from the epithet
"<i>lechem oni</i>" that <i>matzah</i> is "<i>lechem she'onim
alav d'varim harbei</i>." The same root, "<i>anah</i>" is
employed by the Torah regarding <i>bikkurim</i>, in which the Torah states,
"<i>v'anisa v'amarta</i>". This dictional similarity
connects the two passages, thereby including <i>mikra</i> <i>bikkurim</i> on <i>Seder</i>
night. </p>

<P>The Abarbanel, however, maintains a
more conceptual approach: both <i>sippur yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> and <i>mikra</i>
<i>bikkurim</i> constitute the paradigmatic expressions of thanksgiving to <i>HaKadosh
Baruch Hu</i>. Both <i>mitzvos</i> thank <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> for the good
which He has bestowed -particularly, the Exodus from <i>Mitzrayim</i>
- and both passages begin with "<i>gnus</i>" and conclude
with "<i>shevach</i>." In comparing the two <i>mitzvos</i>, Abarbanel
goes as far as to suggest that one should see the items on the Seder plate as a
form of <i>bikkurim</i>, thanking <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> for the wondrous
Exodus from <i>Mitzrayim</i>. </p>

<P>The relationship between <i>sippur yetziyas
Mitzrayim</i> and <i>bikkurim</i> is particularly clear from the Ramban's
(<i>Shemos</i> 13:16) understanding of <i>sippur yetziyas Mitzrayim</i>. The Ramban
argues that the purpose of the awesome miracles of <i>yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> is
to attune individuals throughout the generations to the myriad of
"hidden" miracles which HaKadosh <i>Baruch Hu</i> performs each and
every day. These miracles are no less deserving of acknowledgement and
thanksgiving on the part of the individual. In the mitzvah of <i>bikkurim</i>,
we do just that: the farmer acknowledges that the most "natural"
processes of agriculture and planting are not a result of his own efforts, but
rather a miraculous gift from <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> which deserves
thanksgiving.</p>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Benjamin Yudin]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2008]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: mishpatim]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[



<P>The immediate proximity of <i>Mishpatim</i>, the Torah's
interpersonal legal system, to the <i>Aseres Hadibros</i> is explained by the <i>Mechilta</i>
to indicate that just as the <i>Dibros</i> are from Sinai, so to the <i>Mishpatim</i>
are from Sinai. Rav Yosef Salant <i>zt"l</i>, in <i>Be'er Yosef</i>, explains
that only the purification process undergone by the Jews at Sinai enabled them
to accept the <i>mishpatim</i>. At first glance, an integral part of many of
the <i>mishpatim</i> is t<i>zedaka</i>. If one purchases an <i>eved Ivri</i>,
the fact that there are serious limitations regarding the nature of the work
the master can impose on the servant (ex. - carrying his robe and slippers to
the bath house is not allowed) reflects the dignity and rehabilitation that is
to be afforded the former thief. Our acceptance of this higher standard of law
that integrates great sensitivity to the next one's feelings could only occur
after that Jewish people experienced the revelation of Hashem at Sinai (<i>Shabbos</i>
146a).</p>



<P>I'd like to suggest another understanding of the
juxtaposition of <i>mishpatim</i> to the revelation. The <i>Medrash Shemos
Rabba</i> (29:1) teaches on the <i>passuk</i>, "<i>kol hashem bakoach</i> - the
voice of Hashem comes in power" (<i>Tehillim</i> 29:4) to refer not to the <i>koach</i>
of Hashem which would be unbearable by man, but rather <i>b'koach</i> means in
accordance with the ability (<i>koach</i>) of each individual. Young people
understood the <i>Aseres Hadibros</i> one way, and those more mature understood
it on a more sophisticated level. The <i>mitzvah</i> not to murder can be
understood literally or to prohibit embarrassing someone publicly. The <i>mitzvah</i>
not to steal was understood by some to prohibit kidnapping, by others to
prohibit taking someone else's property, and by others to forbid giving a false
impression (<i>gneivas da'as</i>). Just as these laws were understood in a
variety of ways and beyond the literal meaning there are additional levels of
comprehension, similarly the <i>mishpatim</i> are often presented speaking to
the lowest common denominator, but contain many additional levels of
application.</p>



<P>The Torah teaches (<i>Vayikra</i> 19:13) that one is to pay one's workers in a timely fashion. The Talmud (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 83a)
teaches that Rabbah Bar Rav Huna hired workers to transport barrels of wine on
his behalf. The workers were negligent and broke some of the barrels, prompting
Rabbah to confiscate their coats as collateral for the damages caused. They
went to Rav who ordered Rabbah to return their coats. When Rabbah questioned if
this indeed the <i>halacha</i>, Rav answered in the affirmative citing <i>Mishlei</i>
(2:20), "<i>lma'an teilech b'derech tovim</i> - in order that you may walk in
the way of the good." When the workers further complained that they had worked
all day and are poor and had not been compensated, Rav ordered Rabbah to pay
them. Once again Rabbah questioned if this is the <i>halacha</i>, and Rav
answered yes, citing the second half of the above verse, "<i>v'orchos tzadikim
tishmor</i> - and keep the paths of the righteous." This teaches the very
important concept of <i>lifnim mishuras hadin</i> - going beyond the letter of
the law. Rav understood that Rabbah had attained such a high level of character
development that for him "<i>vhalachta bdrachav</i>" (<i>Devarim</i> 28:9)
required that he pay his negligent workers, just as Hashem enables the sinner
to sin (as noted by the Tomer Devora).</p>



<P>The Torah (<i>Shemos</i> 35:4) teaches regarding <i>Shabbos</i>,
"<i>y'hiyeh lachem kodesh</i> - it shall be holy for you." The Netziv
understands this to mean that each individual ("you") shall make <i>Shabbos</i>
holy according to his spiritual station. For the ignorant unlearned Jew this means
that <i>Shabbos</i> is the day that he is especially careful not to lie. Thus
while a buyer of produce generally could not rely on the uncultured farmer's
assertion that the produce had been tithed, on <i>Shabbos</i> the farmer can be
relied upon. Clearly the extended application of this teaching is that the
table talk of the learned and more observant Jew should rise above politics and
sports to be comprised of <i>divrei Torah</i>.</p>



<P>In conclusion, there is a delicious relevant story. Someone
stopped the Chafetz Chaim and asked him if he change of a large bill. When the
Chafetz Chaim took out his wallet to look, the enquirer grabbed his wallet and
ran. The Chafetz Chaim did what every person would do and ran after the
scoundrel. However, instead of shouting the usual "thief" or "stop that man",
he shouted repeatedly "I am <i>mochel</i> - I forgive you and absolve you of
the obligation to repay". To the Chafetz Chaim, <i>lo tignov</i> was such a
serious offense that his immediate response was to prevent a Jew from being
labeled a robber, rather than to attempt to retrieve his money. Rabbah Bar Rav
Huna and the Chafetz Chaim might not yet be representative of the norm, but they
do raise the bar and demonstrate the lofty levels of our Divine <i>Mishpatim</i>.</p>

		<date><![CDATA[2008]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: tazria]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The very first Rashi of the Torah teaches that the Torah
should have begun with, ?<i>Hachodesh hazeh lochem</i>?, which gives the Jewish
people the obligation to establish its calendar, as it is the first <i>mitzvah</i>
that was given to the Jewish nation. The Torah, which is our constitution,
should have begun with the laws for the entire people, as opposed to the three <i>mitzvos</i>
found in <i>Sefer Braishis</i> that were given to individuals. A more profound
way to understand this Rashi is that just as <i>maaseh Braishis</i> (creation)
is such a phenomenal event that it is most difficult to describe and appreciate
its magnitude, similarly ?<i>Hachodesh hazeh lochem</i>?, the first <i>mitzvah</i>,
is a type of <i>Braishis</i>, a new creation (Rav Chaim Freidlander, <i>Sifsei
Chaim</i>, p. 259).</p>



<P>The concept of an individual or a nation enslaving another
was nothing new with the Egyptian servitude of <i>Am Yisroel</i>. However, we
were not only freed, transformed into free individuals, and elevated to the
status of aristocrats, but ?<i>Hachodesh hazeh lochem</i>? teaches we were also
sanctified by Hashem at that moment, a made into a new creation. As in <i>Braishis</i>
(2:7) where Hashem blew into the nostrils of man a living soul, here at their
emancipation Hashem endowed the former slaves with <i>kedusha</i>, enabling
them to sanctify and hallow themselves and their environment.</p>



<P>Rav Yehoshua Ben Levi teaches in <i>Pesachim</i> (118a)
that Psalm 136, known as <i>Hallel Hagadol</i>, which speaks of Hashem?s
creation and rulership of the world contains twenty six verses of ?<i>ki l?olam
chasdo</i> ? for His kindness endures forever? corresponding to the twenty six
generations from creation until the revelation at Sinai. The emphasis being on <u>His</u>
kindness, as G-d sustained the world not because of the merit or deservedness of
man, but only because of His munificence and kindness. Now, on <i>Rosh Chodesh
Nissan</i>, with <i>hachodesh hazeh</i>, a new world order was introduced.
Hashem sanctified the Jewish people who were given the capacity to sanctify
both time and objects (<i>Shemos Rabbah</i> 15:24). <i>Mekadesh Yisroel vehazemanim</i>, the <i>bracha</i> of <i>Kiddush</i> and every <i>shemoneh esrei</i>
of the <i>yomim tovim</i>, highlights our capacity to sanctify time; when man
takes parchment, quill, and ink for the purpose of writing a <i>sefer Torah</i>,
upon completion man has created <i>kedusha</i>. The world was no longer
completely on the receiving end but man now influences the events that emanate
from on High by his actions. <i>Parshas Hachodesh</i> places the Jew on the
pedestal of <i>mekadesh</i> ? one who creates and endows <i>kedusha</i>.</p>



<P><i>Parshas Tazria</i> with its many laws related to <i>negaim</i>
(commonly translated as leprosy) demonstrates a further and additional Divine
endowment to man. The law regarding <i>tzaraas</i> is that if a <i>baheres</i>,
a variation of a white patch on the skin, preceded the presence of white hair,
the area and individual are pronounced <i>tamei</i> ? impure. If the white hair
preceded the patch he is <i>tahor</i> ? pure. If we don?t know which came
first, the Talmud (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 86a) tells us of a most remarkable and
unusual debate on the matter. Hashem and his heavenly yeshiva disagreed on this
case with Hashem ruling that the individual was <i>tahor</i> and the angels
siding with the opinion that he is <i>tamei</i>. It was decided that the
tie-breaking vote and opinion to be followed would be that of Rabbah bar Nachmeini,
the recognized leading Ravnic authority on <i>negiam</i> in his day. The
question reached Rabbah while he was in the throngs of death. His last two
words on this earth were, ?<i>Tahor tahor</i>?. A heavenly voice proclaimed, ?How
fortunate you are, Rabbah bar Nachmeini, that your body is pure and your soul
departed in purity.?</p>



<P>It is most fascinating to note that the Rambam (<i>Hilchos
Tumas Tzaraas</i>, 2:8) rules <i>tamei</i> in the above case. The Kesef Mishna
explains this based upon the verse in <i>Devarim</i> (30:12), ?<i>Lo bashomayim
he</i> ? it is not in Heaven?, which is understood earlier in <i>Bava Metzia</i>
(59b) to mean that the Jewish people were given the capacity to expound and
interpret <i>Torah Shebal Peh</i> ? the oral law. Prophecy, and even Heavenly
voices, are not to be relied upon for <i>psak halacha</i>, but rather the due
diligence of <i>talmedei chachamim</i> using the formula given to them to
interpret Jewish law (the Chasam Sofer understands that since Rabbah bar
Nachmeini?s decision was only made known through a <i>bask kol</i> (Heavenly
voice) it was not to be relied upon). Wow! Man is not only a <i>mekadeish</i>,
one who sanctifies himself and his environment by his performance of <i>mitzvos</i>.
He is also a <i>mechadeish</i> ? one who is invited to interpret and apply
Torah law. Of course this permissibility was granted to the <i>Sanhedrin</i>,
the judicial body both legislative and representative of the Jewish nation.</p>



<P>?<i>Hachodesh hazeh lochem</i>? is really a second <i>Braishis</i>,
a new creation, namely the Jewish nation. Rashi understands the first <i>passuk</i>
in the Torah - ?<i>Braishis bara</i>? - to be charged with the meaning of why Hashem
created the world: <i>Braishis</i> ? for <i>raishis</i>, i.e. the Jewish people
whoa re called <i>raishis</i>, and <i>Braishis</i>, for the Torah called that
is <i>raishis</i>. Now in <i>Shemos</i> (12) we have the implementation of <i>Braishis</i>.
The Jewish people are enhancing and giving fruition, purpose, and meaning to
creation. Hashem creates the physical material and the Jew endows it with
holiness. He takes string and affixes it to a garment over which he recites ?<i>asher
kidshanu bmitzvosov</i> - ?who has sanctified us with his commandments?, and we
in turn sanctify our environment with this and all other performances of <i>mitzvos</i>.
Furthermore, our ruling in <i>Halacha</i> validates <i>Braishis</i>, the world
being created for Torah.</p>



<P>The two-Torah experience this <i>Shabbos</i> ? <i>Tazria</i>
and <i>Hachodesh</i> ? not only sheds additional light on <i>Yetzias Mitzrayim</i>
as a second <i>Braishis</i>, but also compliments and charges each member of <i>Klal
Yisroel</i> to realize how important they are.</p>

<P>Rav Elchonon Wasserman, hy'd.(1875-1941) studied
under Rav Shimon Shkopp <i>zt"l</i>, and later under Rav Chaim
Brisker, <i>zt"l</i>. At age 32 he joined the <i>Kodshim kollel</i> of
the Chafetz Chaim who subsequently became his lifetime role model. In 1921 he
became head of the yeshiva in Baronovitch where he remained for the rest of his
life. When the Chafetz Chaim planned to make aliyah, a delegation of Ravs
came to plead with him to stay. As the spiritual leader of eastern European
Jewry, they protested how he could leave them. The Chafetz Chaim answered
"you don't need to worry; I will leave behind Rav
Wasserman." </p>

<P>There is a heart breaking eye-witness report of the
execution of Rav Elchonon Wasserman and his students on the 11<sup>th</sup>
of Tammuz, 1941. Rav Elchonon was taken with his students from amidst their
studying Torah to their place of execution. Rav Wasserman said, "it
seems that in Heaven they consider us righteous people as we had been chosen to
atone with our bodies for the Jewish people. We must therefore repent
immediately, the time is short. We must keep in mind that with our repentance
our sacrifice will be more pure, and with that we will save the lives of our
brothers and sisters in America. The fire that will consume our bodies, that
very same fire will rebuild the Jewish people."</p>

<P>The Torah in <i>Parshas Vayishlach</i> (32:25) teaches
"Yaakov was left alone and a man wrestled with him until the break of
dawn." The <i>medrash</i> (<i>Bereishis Rabbah</i> 77:3) identifies the
attacker as the attacker as guardian angel of Esau. The <i>Tanchuma</i> (<i>Vayishlach</i>
8) adds that his name is Samoel. Rav Elchonon Wasserman, in his <i>Kobeitz Maamarim</i>,
asks why is it that this angel, whose mission is to protect Esau and his
culture, attacked specifically Yaakov? Why not wrestle with the founding
fathers of the Jewish nation, Avraham or Yitzchak?</p>

<P>His answer is most fascinating and profound. He cites the <i>Yerushalmi</i>
(<i>Chagigah</i> 1:7) that Hashem is patient and can even overlook the three
gRavest sins of idolatry, adultery and murder, but does not forgive the sin of <i>bittul
Torah</i>, neglect of Torah study. He explained the above challenging question
with the following metaphor. When two adversaries fight one another, even if
one side is victorious today, the other side can regroup and there is always a
chance for a further and stronger battle tomorrow. However, if one side seizes the
weapons and the ammunition of the other, leaving them totally defenseless, the
war is over as they have nothing to fight with. Similarly, the <i>Talmud</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i>
30b) teaches that Hashem declares "I created the <i>yetzer harah</i>
[evil inclination] and simultaneously I provided the antidote to control and
defeat it, namely the study of Torah". The Angel Samoel, representing the
<i>yetzer harah</i> according the Rav Wasserman, knows that there is no other
force that can over power him. Therefore, when the Jewish people, G-d forbid,
are deficient and derelict in their study of Torah, they have, for all
practical purposes, surrendered their armaments and weaponry. </p>

<P>It is for this reason, Rav Wasserman argues, that the
angel Samoel attacks Yaakov, who resides in the tents of Torah, and not Avraham,
the pillar of <i>chessed,</i> or Yitzchak, the pillar of service. Specifically Yaakov,
who represents Torah learning, is the target and victim of the <i>yetzer harah</i>.
Rav Wasserman quotes his <i>rebbi</i>, the Chafetz Chaim, "the <i>yetzer
harah</i> does not mind if the Jew does kindness, fasts, and prays all day; as
long as he does not study Torah!"</p>

<P>[Note: historically, we don't find that they closed
the Jewish Hospital in Volozhin, only the Yeshiva]</p>

<P>Why is Torah the antidote to the <i>yetzer harah</i>?
Firstly, "an educated consumer is the best customer." The more one
studies, the more one's level of observance is enhanced. Moreover, the
study of Torah alone has the ability to transform one character and
personality. In <i>Tehillim</i> (19:11) King David extols Torah as
"sweeter than honey and drippings of the combs." Regarding honey we
find a fascinating <i>halacha</i>: if one finds a piece of the bee in the
honey, the Rosh (<i>Berachos</i> 6:35) cites <i>Rabbeinu</i> Yonah that one may
eat that piece of bee because <i>halachically</i> it has transformed into
honey. However, an entire bee may not be consumed. Honey can not or does not
change the entire bee. Torah is sweeter and stronger than honey as it
transforms the entire being. "K<i>udsha Brich Hu v'Oraisa chad hu -</i>
Hashem and his Torah are inseparable", therefore one who studies Torah
literally imbibes G-dliness. </p>

<P>In the introduction to Mesilas Yesharim, Rav Chaim Luzato
quotes the kabbalist Rav Hershel Ostropoler <i>zt"l</i> that prior to
the Chelministky Massacres, the Satan came to him in a dream and told him he
was prepared to rescind the decree against the Jewish communities of central
Europe if they would stop learning Torah. Rav Ostropoler refused the
Satan's offer. </p>

<P><i>Bereishis</i> (32:26) states "<i>va-teikah kaf yerech
Ya'akov</i> - Yaakov's hip socket was dislocated". The
commentaries understand the symbolism of this encounter in the following way.
When the Angel sees that he can not topple Yaakov, he strikes a serious blow to
his descendants, his children. They are deflected from <i>talmud Torah</i> by
either persecution or assimilation. Additionally, the Zohar understands the
"<i>yerech</i> Ya'akov" to <i>tomchin d'Oraisa</i>
- the supporters of Torah. Rav Wasserman writes in his <i>Ikvisa D'Mashicha</i>
that in the difficult period preceding the coming of the <i>mashiach</i> people
will not realize the importance of <i>talmud Torah</i> and will support other
Jewish causes, but Jewish education will not be a priority. </p>

<P>We live in very challenging times. We have so many things
competing for our down time that Torah learning is too often not a priority.
Unlike Rav Teitz <i>zt"l</i> who said that "killing time should
be considered a capital offense," too many don't realize the
excitement, freshness, and spiritual exhilaration that one can derive from <i>talmud
Torah</i>. In addition, in our challenging economic times, we must ask <i>halachic</i>
questions as to how to prioritize our giving of <i>tzedakah</i>. "<i>Talmud
Torah k'neged kulam</i>" (<i>Mishna Peah</i> 1:1), including local yeshiva scholarships funds, must not loose its supremacy.

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The <i>Gemarah</i> (<i>Shabbos</i> 25a) teaches that "<i>Hadlakas
ner b'Shabbos chovah</i>" - the <i>mitzvah</i> to light <i>Shabbos</i>
candles is a binding obligation. In characterizing the source and nature of
this "obligation," the <i>Rishonim</i> appear to identify two
different values. In the thirtieth chapter of <i>Hilchos Shabbos</i> (<i>Halacha</i>
4), the Rambam associates <i>Shabbos</i> candles with the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>kavod
Shabbos</i> - honoring the <i>Shabbos</i>. This association is further
highlighted by the <i>Hagahos Maimoniyos</i> (<i>Hil. Shabbos</i> 5:1), who cites
the opinion of the <i>Yerushalmi</i> that the <i>beracha</i> for <i>Shabbos</i>
candles should read "<i>L'hadlik ner l'kavod Shabbos</i>."
In the fifth chapter of <i>Hilchos Shabbos</i>, however, the Rambam links <i>ner
Shabbos</i> with <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>oneg </i>Shabbbos - delighting in the <i>Shabbos</i>.
Apparently, then, the Rambam maintains that the lighting of Shabbos candles
fulfills both the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>kavod Shabbos</i> as well as the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>oneg Shabbos</i>. The Vilna <i>Gaon</i> (<i>Beiur HaGra</i> <i>Orach Chaim</i>
529:1) explains the difference between <i>kavod</i> and <i>oneg</i> <i>Shabbos</i>.
While both <i>kavod</i> and <i>oneg</i> refer to activities performed in honor of
the Shabbos, the distinction between these <i>mitzvos</i> lies in their
respective timing. Activities which are done in anticipation of <i>Shabbos</i>,
i.e. before the commencement of <i>Shabbos</i>, such as cooking and cleaning
the house, fulfill the mitzvah of <i>kavod Shabbos</i>. Activities performed on
<i>Shabbos</i> itself, such as eating satiating meals, fulfill the mitzvah of <i>oneg
Shabbos</i>.</p>



<P>Given the <i>Gaon's</i> explanation, the Rambam's
understanding of <i>ner Shabbos</i> as a fulfillment of both <i>kavod</i> and <i>oneg</i>
<i>Shabbos</i> becomes clear: by lighting the candles on Friday afternoon in
preparation for Shabbos, one fulfills <i>kavod Shabbos</i>; by allowing the
candles to continue to burn into <i>Shabbos</i> itself, providing an illuminated
room which enhances the Shabbos experience, one fulfills <i>oneg Shabbos</i>.
Based on this analysis, it emerges that our practice of lighting <i>Shabbos</i>
candles before the actual commencement of <i>Shabbos</i> is not simply a
function of the prohibition to light candles on <i>Shabbos</i> itself. Rather,
Friday afternoon is the optimal time for lighting <i>Shabbos</i> candles, so
that the lighting serves as a preparation for the incoming <i>Shabbos</i>
thereby fulfilling the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>kavod Shabbos</i>.</p>



<P>This understanding of the time of lighting may bear
practical ramifications regarding <i>Yom Tov</i>, which similarly entails mitzvos
of <i>kavod</i> and <i>oneg</i> (see <i>Rambam Hilchos Yom Tov</i> 6:16). Although one is permitted to light candles on <i>Yom Tov</i> itself, the <i>Drisha</i>
(introduction to <i>Tur Yoreh Deah</i>) cites the practice of his mother to
nonetheless light candles before the commencement of <i>Yom Tov</i>, in order
to fulfill the preparatory mitzvah of <i>kavod Yom Tov</i>. While the <i>Drisha</i>
suggests that one should not follow this practice before the second night of <i>Yom
Tov</i> in the Diaspora in order to avoid "preparing" from one day
of <i>Yom Tov</i> to the next, <i>Tosafos</i> (<i>Beitzah</i> 22a s.v. <i>Ain</i>)
argue that such a practice is indeed permissible. Since the lighting of the
candle illuminates the dark room the lighting provides immediate benefit for the
current day of <i>Yom Tov</i>, and is therefore not deemed a preparation for
the next day of <i>Yom Tov</i>.</p>



<P>This understanding may also account for the opinion of the Rambam
challenged by the Rashba. Regarding the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>Chanuka</i>, the Rambam
rules (<i>Hilchos Chanuka</i> 4:5) that one may not light <i>Chanuka</i>
candles before nightfall, even if the pre-lit candles continue burning into the
night. The Rashba (<i>Shabbos</i> 21a s.v. <i>Ha d'amrinan</i>) disagrees,
arguing that as long as the candles continue to burn through the requisite time
of night, one may indeed light the <i>Chanuka</i> candles early. As support for
his opinion, the Rashba cites the case of <i>Shabbos</i> candles, which
similarly are kindled before the time of the <i>mitzvah</i> (before <i>Shabbos</i>),
but by continuing to burn into <i>Shabbos</i> night, fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i>
nonetheless. Apparently, infers the Rashba, one may always light candles before
the ordained time of the <i>mitzvah</i>, as long as the candles continue to
burn for the requisite time period.</p>



<P>In defense of the Rambam's opinion, R' Turtzin (<i>Kuntrus
B'Inyanei Chanuka U'Megilla</i> 1) draws a fundamental distinction
between <i>ner Shabbos</i> and <i>ner Chanuka</i>. The <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>ner
Chanuka</i> begins at nightfall. Prior to nightfall, there is no mitzvah to
light, and one who does light is indeed considered to be lighting early. <i>Ner
Shabbos</i>, however, is quite different. Because of the preparatory nature of
the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>kavod Shabbos</i>, the actual time of the <i>mitzvah</i>
is Friday afternoon. Lighting before <i>Shabbos</i> is not considered to be
lighting early, but rather, lighting in the proper time. Because no preparatory
<i>mitzvah</i> of <i>kavod</i> exists on <i>Chanuka</i>, one cannot compare the
<i>mitzvah</i> of <i>ner Shabbos</i> with the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>ner Chanuka</i>.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: pesach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Although
the Talmud <i>Bavli</i> addresses the <i>halachos</i> of the <i>arba kosos</i>,
it never cites a source for the <i>mitzvah</i> (see the Ran, 19a in the <span
 style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:125%'>Rif<span style='font-size:
11.0pt;line-height:125%'> s.v. "<i>Me'arba'ah</i>," who
asserts that the <i>arba kosos</i> were instituted so that each of the four
sections of the <i>Seder</i> would be recited over wine). The Talmud <i>Yerushalmi</i>
(<i>Pesachim</i> 10:1), however, cites numerous possible sources:</p>

<p>R' Yochanan said in the name of R' Benaya: [the
four cups] correspond to the four expressions of redemption&#8230; R' Yehoshua
ben Levi said: they correspond to the four cups of [the butler of]
Pharaoh's dream... R' Levi said: they correspond to the four
kingdoms. The Ravs say: they correspond to the four cups of affliction which <i>HaKadosh
Baruch Hu</i> will eventually serve to the nations of the world&#8230;And
corresponding to them, <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> will serve <i>Bnei Yisrael</i>
four cups of comfort.</p>

<p>The <i>Medrash Rabba</i> (<i>Shemos</i>
6:4) states that the four expressions of redemption mentioned by R' Benaya
in turn correspond to the four decrees which Pharaoh wrought against <i>Bnei Yisrael</i>.
Moreover, the Meiri (<i>Pesachim</i> 99b s.v. "<i>V'lo</i>")
adds that each of the four expressions signifies a redemption within itself: "<i>V'hotzeisi</i>"
refers to the redemption from the physical servitude of <i>Mitzrayim</i>. "<i>V'hitzalti</i>"
refers to redemption from the &#8216;normal' subjugations of kingdoms,
such as taxes and tributes to the king. "<i>V'ga'alti</i>"
teaches that <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu </i>will bring about the complete domination
of the Jewish people over their foes. And "<i>V'lakachti</i>"
alludes to the giving of the Torah, which is the "<i>tachlis hakol</i> -&nbsp;
the ultimate purpose of everything."</p>

<P>Interestingly,
Rashi seems to acknowledge multiple sources for the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>arba kosos</i>.
In the opening <i>mishnah</i> of <i>perek Arvei Pesachim</i> (<i>Pesachim</i>
99b), Rashi cites the four expressions of redemption as the definitive source
for the <i>arba kosos</i>. Later in the <i>perek</i>, however (<i>Pesachim</i>
108a), when explaining R' Yehoshua ben Levi's ruling that women are
obligated to drink the <i>arba kosos</i>, Rashi cites the dream of
Pharaoh's butler. These differing sources pose some uncertainty regarding
Rashi's own opinion. <i>HaGaon</i> R' Betzalel HaCohen (<i>Haghos Mar'eh
Kohen Pesachim</i> 108a) explains Rashi's sources contextually: because
R' Yehoshua ben Levi himself issued the ruling on <i>Pesachim</i> 108a, Rashi
cites R' Yehoshua ben Levi's own opinion in the Talmud <i>Yerushalmi</i>
regarding the dream of Pharaoh's butler. On the <i>mishnah</i>, however, Rashi
cites the four expressions of redemption because only they can adequately
account for the <i>mishnah's</i> subsequent ruling that "even an
indigent pauper must purchase (or receive) four cups of wine on Seder
night." The four expressions of redemption highlight the fact that the
mitzvah of <i>arba kosos</i> constitutes "<i>pirsumei nisah</i>"
- publicizing a miracle. The critical value of <i>pirsumei nisah</i>
overrides fiscal concerns, obligating even the most penurious members of <i>Klal
Yisrael</i> to fulfill the mitzvah. R' HaCohen infers from Rashi's
citation of alternate sources that the opinions in the <i>Yerushalmi</i> are
not necessarily in disagreement. Rather, each source adds an additional
dimension to the nature and importance of the mitzvah.</p>

<P>As
noted, the Talmud <i>Bavli</i> conspicuously omits any source for the <i>arba kosos</i>.
Perhaps this omission may relate to a deeper understanding of the conceptual
nature of the <i>arba kosos</i>. R' Chaim Soloveitchik (cited in <i>Chidushei
HaGriz Hilchos Chametz U'Matzah</i> 7:9) observed that, objectively, the <i>arba
kosos</i> may be said to consist of two components: "recital" of
the various parts of the Seder over a cup of wine, and "drinking"
of the wine itself. While all opinions agree that both "recital"
and "drinking" constitute critical components of the mitzvah, the <i>rishonim</i>
seem to debate which one of these two components constitutes the essence of the
mitzvah, and which one serves a more technical, ancillary role. This analysis
may account for a number of fundamental disputes between the <i>rishonim</i>,
and may shed light on the <i>Bavli's</i> omission of any source for the <i>arba
kosos</i>.</p>

<P>One
area in which this investigation may express itself pertains to the question of
whether one must actually drink in order to fulfill the mitzvah of <i>arba kosos</i>.
Tosafos (<i>Pesachim</i> 99b, s.v. "<i>Lo</i>") argues that the
mitzvah of <i>arba kosos</i> may be fulfilled through the vehicle of "<i>shomeiah
k'oneh</i>," which renders listening tantamount to speech. By
simply listening to the recital of the <i>bracha</i>, one fulfills the
obligation, even without drinking any wine. In this respect, Tosafos analogizes
the mitzvah of <i>arba kosos</i> to the mitzvah of Kiddush throughout the year,
which also does not necessitate actual drinking on the part of the listener. The
Rambam (<i>Hilchos Chametz U'Matzah</i> 7:7), however, disagrees. In
order to fulfill one's obligation of <i>arba kosos</i>, one must actually
drink four cups of wine. Unlike Kiddush of the rest of the year, mere listening
is insufficient.</p>

<P>R'
Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik explains that this <i>machlokes</i> may reflect a
fundamental difference of opinion regarding the nature of <i>arba kosos</i>. Tosafos,
who accept the mechanism of "<i>shomeia k'oneh</i>" in lieu
of actual drinking, view "recital" as the main component of the
mitzvah. The presence of the cup serves to embellish and to confer significance
to the verbal elements of the Seder. Drinking itself is merely a technical
requirement which follows the recital. As such, one could theoretically fulfill
one's obligation without drinking any wine at all. The Rambam, however,
perceives the actual drinking of the wine as the definition of the mitzvah. Hence,
although "<i>shomeia k'oneh</i>" can compensate for lack of
speech, it cannot redress the lack of drinking by the listener, and is thus an
insufficient means for fulfilling one's obligation</p>

<P>Tosafos'
opinion, that the primary component of the <i>arba kosos</i> exists in the
"recital," not the actual drinking, is also evinced in their comments
to <i>Maseches Succah</i> (38a s.v. "<i>mi</i>"). Tosafos note that
although women are generally exempt from the positive time-bound mitzvah of <i>Hallel</i>,
women are nonetheless obligated to recite the <i>Hallel</i> of Seder night. Tosafos
prove this obligation from the fact that women are obligated in <i>arba kosos</i>:
if the role of <i>arba kosos</i>, Tosafos reason, is to serve as an
"enhancer," conferring greater significance to the recital of <i>Hallel</i>
and <i>Hagaddah</i>, it follows that anyone obligated in the <i>arba kosos</i> must
certainly be obligated in the recital of <i>Hallel</i> and <i>Haggadah</i>
itself. Tosafos' reasoning presupposes the assumption that the essential
component of the <i>arba kosos</i> is to enhance the recital of the <i>Hallel</i>
and <i>Haggadah</i>, not the actual drinking itself.</p>

<P>This
<i>machlokes</i> may also account for the necessary <i>shiur</i> (requisite
amount) of <i>arba kosos</i>. The Rambam (<i>Hilchos Chametz U'Matzah</i>
7:9) rules that one must drink a "rov kos" - the majority of
a cup - in order to fulfill the mitzvah. The Ramban (quoted in Beis Yosef
O.C. 472:9) concurs, adding that even if the volume of the cup is extremely
large, one must drink the majority of that particular cup. This <i>shiur</i>
exceeds the regular "<i>m'lo lugmav</i>," or cheek full,
necessary for <i>Kiddush</i> throughout the year. The uniqueness of this <i>shiur</i>
may also relate to the nature of <i>arba kosos</i>. If the essence of <i>arba kosos</i>
lies in the "recital," enhancing the portions of the Seder which
are recited over wine, <i>arba kosos</i> should be no different than Kiddush,
and a cheek full should suffice. If, however, the emphasis of <i>arba kosos</i>
lies in the actual drinking of the wine, one could well envision a new <i>shiur arba
kosos</i> of "<i>rov kos</i>"
(the Talmudic principle of "<i>rubo k'kulo</i>" equates
drinking the majority of the cup with drinking the entire cup).</p>

<P>A
further ramification of this analysis may emerge regarding whether or not the
wine of the <i>arba kosos</i> must be diluted. In Talmudic times, wine was sold
in a strong, undiluted form, which only attained optimal drinking taste after
being diluted with water. According to Tosafos, who perceive the essence of the
mitzvah in the recital as opposed to the actual drinking, dilution of the wine
is not critical (although it is certainly commendable). According to the Rambam's
opinion, however, the drinking itself constitutes the central aspect of the
mitzvah. As such, perhaps greater importance is placed on the details of the
drinking, and diluted wine would be essential to fully fulfill the mitzvah.</p>

<P>Finally,
this analysis may also account for the <i>Bavli's</i> omission of any
source for the mitzvah of <i>arba kosos</i>. If the drinking of the wine itself
constituted the central component of the mitzvah, a source should seemingly be
necessary to teach the new <i>halacha</i>. If, however, the cups serve merely
to enhance the recital of the <i>Hallel</i> and <i>Hagaddah</i> of the Seder,
perhaps the mitzvah of <i>arba kosos</i> is subsumed under the larger mitzvah
of <i>Hallel</i> and <i>Haggadah</i>. Because <i>arba kosos</i> does not
constitute an independent mitzvah, no independent source is necessary.</p>

(<I>Shemos</I> 12:8), for example, suggests that the breaking of the
<I>matzah</I> may represent the splitting of the <I>Yam Suf</I> and
the Jordan River. Similarly, the Chidah (<I>Haggadas Simchas HaRegel</I>)
adds that the splitting of the <I>matzah</I> into two halves may
symbolize the teaching of Pirkei D&rsquo;Rav Eliezer (ch. 48), that
<I>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</I> &ldquo;halved&rdquo; the time of the
Egyptian servitude from 430 years to 215 years. These various
understandings of <I>Yachatz</I> underscore that both slavery and
salvation are within the broken <I>matzah</I>, thereby highlighting
the central theme that salvation can instantly emerge from the most
abject situations of suffering.</P>
<P>
While all agree that the <I>matzah</I> must ultimately
be broken, the Rishonim debate precisely <I>when</I> the <I>matzah</I>
should be broken. The Rambam (<I>Hilchos Chametz U&rsquo;Matzah</I>
8:6) implies that one breaks the <I>matzos</I> immediately before
reciting the <I>beracha</I> of &ldquo;<I>Hamotzi lechem min
ha&rsquo;aretz</I>.&rdquo; R&rsquo; Avraham Gershon Zaks (<I>Hagadas
HaGershuni</I>, <I>Yachatz</I>) suggests that this is consistent with
the Rambam&rsquo;s general understanding of <I>lechem mishneh</I>
during the <I>seder</I>. Although <I>lechem mishneh</I> generally
requires two whole and intact loaves, the Rambam rules that <I>lechem
mishneh</I> of <I>seder</I> night consists of one whole and one half
<I>matzah</I>, in keeping with the Gemarah&rsquo;s teaching of &ldquo;<I>ma
darko shel ani beprusa</I>&rdquo;. Apparently, the Rambam understands
the <I>halacha</I> of broken <I>matzah</I> as defining the <I>mitzvah</I>
of <I>lechem mishneh</I>. Therefore, explains R&rsquo; Zaks, it is
perfectly consistent to maintain that the breaking of the <I>matzah</I>
should be performed adjacent to the <I>beracha</I> and consumption of
the <I>lechem mishneh</I> as well. R&rsquo; Zaks adds that this
explanation also accounts for the Rambam&rsquo;s omission of any
broken <I>matzah</I> requirement for the <I>afikomen</I>. Because the
<I>halacha</I> of broken <I>matzah</I> relates specifically to <I>lechem
mishneh</I>, the <I>halacha</I> does not necessarily apply to
<I>afikomen</I>, which is not consumed as <I>lechem mishneh</I>.</P>
<P>
Most <I>rishonim</I> and <I>achronim</I> disagree with
the Rambam, maintaining that the breaking of the <I>matzah</I> must
immediately precede <I>Maggid</I>. Several explanations are suggested
for this timing. The <I>Beis Yosef</I> (O.C. 473) suggests that the
<I>matzah</I> is broken at this point in order to recite &ldquo;<I>Ha
lachma anya</I>,&rdquo; which describes the poor man&rsquo;s bread.
Alternatively, the breaking and hiding of the <I>matzah</I> serves to
pique the curiosity of the children, encouraging them to ask
questions. The <I>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</I> (ibid. 36) suggests a
further possibility. The <I>Gemarah</I> derives a connection between
the consumption of <I>matzah</I> and the recital of the <I>Hagaddah</I>,
noting that <I>matzah</I> is &ldquo;<I>lechem sheonin alav devarim
harbeh</I> - bread upon which many things are recited.&rdquo; Based
on this relationship, one must recite the <I>Hagaddah</I> over <I>matzah</I>
which is <I>halachically</I> fit for fulfillment of the <I>mitzvah</I>
of <I>achilas matzah</I>. Because <I>achilas matzah</I> requires that
the <I>matzah</I> be broken, by extension, the recital of the
<I>Haggadah</I> must be performed over a broken piece as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Ran (<I>Pesachim</I> 25b in Rif, s.v. &ldquo;<I>mihu</I>&rdquo;)
cites Rav Hai <I>Gaon</I>, who understands the early breaking of the
<I>matzah</I> as a function of the general <I>halachos</I> of <I>lechem
mishneh</I>. As the Netziv explains (<I>Shu&rdquo;t Meishiv Davar</I>
I: 21), <I>lechem mishneh</I> generally requires two intact loaves of
bread. For purposes of <I>lechem mishneh</I>, however, &ldquo;intact&rdquo;
is defined in a relative sense: if the <I>mevarech</I> breaks a whole
loaf prior to reciting the <I>beracha</I>, the loaf is certainly <I>not</I>
considered &ldquo;intact.&rdquo; If, however, the <I>mevarech</I>
<I>receives </I>a loaf which has <I>already </I>been<I> </I>broken,
the loaf is <I>halachically</I> considered &ldquo;intact,&rdquo;
since the completeness of the loaf is defined relative to its form at
the time of reception. Hence, explains the Netziv, by breaking the
<I>matzah</I> a significant amount of time prior to the actual
<I>beracha</I>, the <I>mevarech</I> can be considered to have
received <I>matzah</I> which was already broken. As such, the broken
<I>matzah</I> is halachically considered &ldquo;whole&rdquo; for
purposes of <I>lechem mishneh</I>, and one thereby fulfills both the
need for &ldquo;poor man&rsquo;s bread&rdquo; as well as the need for
&ldquo;wholeness&rdquo; for <I>lechem mishneh</I>. 
</P>
<P>
One other possibility for the early breaking of the
<I>matzah</I> is suggested by R&rsquo; Shlomo Zalman Aurbach
(<I>Halichos Shlomo</I>, <I>Pesach</I> 9:29). Although <I>halacha</I>
dictates that <I>Kiddush</I> must immediately precede the <I>seuda</I>
of <I>yom tov</I>, the recitation of <I>Maggid</I> on <I>seder</I>
night seems to create a <I>hefsek</I>, separating the <I>Kiddush</I>
from the <I>seuda</I>. By breaking the <I>matzah</I> before the
recital of <I>Maggid</I>, one links the <I>Maggid</I> to the meal,
demonstrates that <I>Maggid</I> is considered <I>mei&rsquo;tzorchei
achila</I> - for the purposes of eating. The <I>Maggid</I> is
therefore not considered a <I>hefsek</I>, but rather a bridge between
the <I>Kiddush</I> and the meal, despite the possible passage of
several hours in between.</P>
<P>
Regarding the actual execution of <I>Yachatz</I>, the
<I>rishonim</I> debate which of the three <I>matzahs</I> should be
broken. The Smag (283) and the Rokeiach (241) rule that the top
<I>matzah</I> should be broken, in accordance with the <I>Talmudic</I>
dictum of &ldquo;<I>Ain ma&rsquo;avirin al hamitzvos </I>- we do not
pass over <I>mitzvos</I>.&rdquo; Of note, Rashi (<I>Yoma</I> 33a s.v.
&ldquo;<I>ain</I>&rdquo;), quoting the Mechilta, maintains that the
very source for this principle comes from the <I>mitzvah</I> of
<I>matzah</I>. As the Mechilta expounds,&rdquo;<I>ushemartem es
ha</I><I><U>matzos</U></I> - you shall guard the <I><U>matzos</U></I>&rdquo;
to read &ldquo;<I>ushemartem es ha</I><I><U>mitzvos</U></I> - you
shall guard the <I><U>mitzvos</U></I>.&rdquo; Thus, if a <I>mitzvah</I>
presents itself, one should not let it pass. While Tosafos (ibid.)
understands this derivation to be <I>mid&rsquo;oraisa</I>, the Radbaz
(ShU&rdquo;T I:559) opines that it is a mere <I>asmachta</I> (see
also Divrei Malchiel O.C. 16).</P>
<P>
Despite the cogent argument of the Smag and Rokeiach,
the accepted <I>halacha</I> follows the Rosh (<I>Pesachim</I> 10:30)
and the Mordechai (<I>Pesachim</I> 38) who maintain that the middle
<I>matzah</I> is broken. In defense of the Rosh and the Mordechai,
the Bach (<I>Orach Chaim</I> 473 s.v. &ldquo;<I>v&rsquo;yikach</I>&rdquo;)
explains that breaking the middle <I>matzah</I> does not violate the
principle of <I>Ain ma&rsquo;avirin al hamitzvos</I>. <I>Eating</I>
the <I>matzah</I>, as opposed to <I>breaking</I> the <I>matzah</I>,
constitutes the primary <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>seder</I> night. When it
comes to eating the <I>matzah</I>, the beracha of &ldquo;<I>Hamotzi
lechem min ha&rsquo;aretz</I>&rdquo; is recited on the top <I>matzah</I>,
while the second <I>bracha</I> of &ldquo;<I>Al achilas matzah</I>&rdquo;
is recited on the broken second <I>matzah</I>, in perfect adherence
to the principle of &ldquo;<I>Ain ma&rsquo;avirin al hamitzvos</I>.&rdquo;
Thus, by breaking the middle <I>matzah</I>, one ensures that he will
<I>not</I> &ldquo;pass over the <I>mitzvos</I>,&rdquo; as this
breaking ensures that the first <I>bracha</I> of &ldquo;<I>Hamotzi</I>&rdquo;
will be appropriately recited on the first <I>matzah</I>.</P>

<P>Although cooking on <i>yom tov</i>
itself is generally permitted, the <i>Gemarah</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 46b) teaches
that one may not cook on <i>yom tov</i> for the sake of a weekday. The <i>Amoraim</i>
dispute the punishment incurred for violation of this prohibition. Rabbah exempts
such an individual from lashes on account of the principle of "<i>ho'eel
u'mikl'ei leih orchim chazi leih</i>" - because the remote
possibility exists that uninvited guests may subsequently arrive in one's
home on <i>yom tov</i>, the individual's cooking can <i>halachically</i>
be considered to be "for the sake of <i>yom tov</i>." Rav Chisda,
however, rejects the principle of "<i>ho'eel</i>," arguing
that one who cooks on <i>yom tov</i> for the sake of a weekday does receive
lashes.</p>



<P>In light of Rav Chisda's
rejection of the "<i>ho'eel</i>" principle, Rabbah questions
how Rav Chisda would account for the accepted <i>halachic</i> permissibility of
cooking on <i>yom tov</i> for the sake of a following <i>Shabbos</i>. Rav Chisda
explains his opinion by distinguishing between a subsequent weekday and a
subsequent <i>Shabbos</i>. While one who cooks on <i>yom tov</i> for the sake
of a weekday violates a Biblical commandment, one who cooks on <i>yom tov</i>
for the sake of <i>Shabbos</i> violates no Biblical prohibition, since "<i>Tzorchei
Shabbos na'asin b'yom tov</i>" - on a Biblical level, one may
cook on <i>yom tov</i> for the sake of <i>Shabbos</i>. Rabbah admits, however,
that the Ravs nonetheless prohibited such an activity, lest one come to cook
on <i>yom tov</i> for the sake of a weekday. If, however, one establishes an <i>eruv
tavshilin</i> as a "recognizable sign," he will never come to
accidentally cook on <i>yom tov</i> for a weekday, and the Ravs then
permitted him to cook on <i>yom tov</i> for <i>Shabbos</i>.</p>



<P>Aside from the practical
ramification of lashes, the <i>machlokes</i> between Rabbah and Rav Chisda may
bear further ramifications. Tosafos (s.v. "Rabbah"), for example,
argue that Rabbah's leniency of "<i>ho'eel</i>" does
not permit cooking for the sake of a weekday that is performed immediately
prior to nightfall. At such a late hour, one cannot reasonably argue that the
cooking is for the sake of potential guests, since the food would not be ready
in time for them to eat on <i>yom tov</i>. Therefore, according to Rabbah, who
views the permissibility of cooking from <i>yom tov</i> to any other day - <i>Shabbos</i>
or weekday - as a function of the principle of <i>ho'eel</i>, one may not
cook prior to nightfall on <i>yom tov</i> that falls on Erev Shabbos. Rav Chisda,
however, who views the allowance to cook on <i>yom tov</i> for the sake of Shabbos
as an independent sanction ("<i>Tzorchei Shabbos na'asin b'yom
tov</i>"), would permit cooking even at such a late hour. Based on Tosafos'
ruling, the Magen Avraham (O.C. 527) notes that it is customary to <i>daven</i>
early when <i>yom tov</i> falls on a Friday, in order to prevent people from
cooking too close to nightfall.</p>



<P>An additional practical
ramification between Rabbah and Rav Chisda may emerge regarding a person who
may not cook for himself. The Mahr'ee Weil (<i>Chelek Dinim</i> 55-56)
argues that one who fasts on <i>yom tov</i> may not cook for someone else,
since such an individual is <i>halachically</i> prohibited from cooking for himself.
The principle of "<i>ho'eel</i>" can only operate if a person
is capable of cooking for himself. Thus, according to Rabbah's reasoning,
even if such a person would wish to cook on a <i>yom tov</i> that falls on <i>Erev
Shabbos</i>, he would be prohibited, given the inapplicability of the "<i>ho'eel</i>"
principle. If, however, one assumes like Rav Chisda, that the independent
permit of "<i>Tzorchei Shabbos na'asin b'yom tov</i>"
is what permits cooking on Friday afternoons, such an individual
would be permitted to cook for the sake of <i>Shabbos</i>.</p>



<P>The <i>Chochmas</i> Shlomo
suggests a further practical ramification. Citing Tosafos (<i>Beitzah</i> 2. s.v.
<i>v'haya</i>), the <i>Chochmas</i> Shlomo suggests that the leniency of
"<i>ho'eel</i>" only works in settings where guests are
generally expected. Therefore, according to Rabbah, a reasonable possibility
must exist that guests will arrive on <i>yom tov</i> in order to cook.
According to Rav Chisda, however, one may cook on Friday afternoons
irrespective of the likelihood of guests' arrival.</p>



<P>The Rambam implies yet an additional
practical ramification. In <i>Hilchos Yom Tov</i> (1:15), the Rambam rules that if one cooks on <i>yom tov</i> for a non-Jew, an animal, or for a
weekday, no lashes are incurred, because Jewish guests might come and consume
the dish on <i>yom tov</i>. The Rambam's ruling implies that such cooking
is only permitted if one accepts the broad leniency of "<i>ho'eel</i>."
Without this principle, however, one could not simply "overlook"
such inappropriate cooking, and such an activity would indeed warrant the
administration of lashes.</p>



<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>The Needs of Shabbos are Done on Yom Tov</b></p>


<P>Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 46a, s.v.
"<i>M'd'oraisa</i>") explains that the argument between
Rabbah and Rav Chisda regarding whether or not "the needs of <i>Shabbos</i>
may be performed on <i>yom tov</i> depends on the <i>halachic</i> relationship
between <i>Shabbos</i> and <i>yom tov</i>. Rav Chisda maintains that one is
Biblically permitted to cook on <i>yom tov</i> for the sake of Shabbos because <i>Shabbos</i>
and <i>yom tov</i> are considered "<i>kedusha achas</i>"- the same level of holiness. Because they
share the same degree of holiness, the sanctity of yom tov fuses with the
sanctity of Shabbos, as if yom tov and Shabbos constituted a single forty-eight
hour day. Thus, according to Rashi, the concept of "<i>kedusha achas</i>"<b></b>-underlies the leniency of Rav Chisda.</p>



<P>The Meiri (Beitzah 4a, s.v.
"Beitzah"), however, disagrees with Rashi's application of "<i>kedusha
achas.</i>" The concept of "<i>kedusha achas,</i>" argues the
Meiri, is merely a Ravnic innovation introduced to create stringencies. For
example, if <i>Shabbos</i> and <i>yom tov</i> are considered "<i>shtei kedushos</i>"<b></b>- two different degrees of holiness - an
egg that was laid on <i>Shabbos</i> (and therefore <i>muktzeh</i>) would be
permitted on <i>yom tov</i> (if <i>yom tov</i> falls on the next day): because <i>Shabbos</i>
and <i>yom tov</i> constitute two distinct entities, the prohibited status of the
egg on the first day does not automatically carry over into the second day. If,
however, the Ravs decreed that <i>Shabbos</i> and <i>yom tov</i> are
considered to be a fused "<i>kedusha achas</i>,"<b></b>tantamount to a forty-eight hour day, then
an egg laid on <i>Shabbos</i> would remain prohibited through <i>yom tov</i>,
given that the second day is merely a <i>halachic</i> extension of the first
day.</p>



<P>The Rambam and Raavad appear to
maintain a similar disagreement regarding whether or not the concept of "<i>kedusha
achas</i>"can ever generate
a leniency. On <i>Shabbos</i> and <i>yom tov</i>, a person may elect to change
his <i>techum</i> boundaries by establishing an "<i>Eruv tichumin</i>"
in a particular location. As long as the "<i>Eruv tichumin</i>" is
extant at the onset of <i>Shabbos</i> or <i>yom tov</i>, it remains valid
throughout the entire duration of <i>Shabbos</i> or <i>yom tov</i>. The Rambam
rules (<i>Hilchos Eruvin</i> 8:8) that one who establishes an "<i>Eruv
tichumin</i>" at the start of a two-day <i>yom tov</i> in the diaspora
must nonetheless establish a new <i>eruv</i> (or ensure the continued existence
of the first <i>eruv</i>) for the second night of yom tov, because the two days
of yom tov are considered to exist independently of one another as "<i>shtei
kedushos."</i> If, however, one was dealing with a situation of "<i>kedusha
achas</i>"(for example, the
two days of <i>Rosh Hashannah</i>), the <i>halacha</i> would be different: the
establishment of a single "Eruv Tichumin" at the onset of the first
night would suffice for both days of yom tov, since the second day exists as an
extension of the first. The Raavad, however, argues with the Rambam's
understanding of "<i>kedusha achas</i>." Even the two days of <i>Rosh
Hashana</i>, which exist as a fused "<i>kedusha achas,</i>"require an independent Eruv on each night,
since the concept of "<i>kedusha achas</i>"can never result in a leniency. The Rambam
and Rashi thus appear to agree that "<i>kedusha achas</i>"can indeed generate leniencies as well as
stringencies.</p>



<P>Based on Rashi's
explanation of the argument between Rabbah and Rav Chisda, the Ramban (<i>Milchamos
Hashem</i>, <i>Beitzah</i> 15a) rules that the <i>halacha</i> must follow Rabbah.
The Ramban bases his argument on the fact that we traditionally consider yom
tov and <i>Shabbos</i> to be "<i>shtei kedushos." </i>If yom tov
and <i>Shabbos</i> exist as two independent sanctities, the Ramban reasons, Rashi's
explanation of Rav Chisda would force us to reject the principle of "<i>Tzorchei
Shabbos na'asin b'yom tov</i>." Tosafos (<i>Pesachim</i> 47a,
s.v. <i>v'ee</i>), however, argue on Rashi, maintaining that Rav Chisda's
opinion of "<i>Tzorchei Shabbos na'asin b'yom tov</i>"
is not rooted in the link between the <i>kedusha</i> of <i>Shabbos</i> and yom
tov. Rather, Rav Chidsa permits preparation for <i>Shabbos</i> on yom tov
because if one would not do so, one would not prepare for <i>Shabbos</i> at all
(in contrast to a weekday). Because there is no other opportunity for such an
individual to prepare, this preparation is deemed "<i>ochel nefesh</i>"
- necessary food preparation, of yom tov itself.</p>



<P>The Baal HaMaor (ibid.) disputes
the Ramban's conclusion, maintaining that the <i>halacha</i> indeed does
follow Rav Chisda. He proves this <i>halacha</i> from the Ravnic prohibition
of inviting a non-Jew to one's home on yom tov, lest one come to cook for
the non-Jew. The Baal HaMaor reasons that if the Ravs enacted an additional
protective prohibition to prevent cooking for a non-Jew, then cooking for a
non-Jew itself must constitute a Biblical prohibition. If cooking for a non-Jew
was itself a Ravnic prohibition, the Ravs would not enact an additional
preventive prohibition, as such a safeguard would constitute a "<i>gezeirah
legezeirah</i> - fence for a fence", which <i>Chazal</i> generally do not
enact. The Baal HaMaor thus concludes that the <i>halacha</i> must follow Rav Chisda:
according to Rabbah, cooking for a non-Jew can only be a Ravnic injunction,
because the principle of "<i>ho'eel</i>" recognizes the
possibility that other Jewish guests might arrive on yom tov. According to Rav Chisda,
we do not accept the principle of "<i>ho'eel</i>," and
cooking for a non-Jew on yom tov violates a Biblical prohibition.</p>



<P>Whether Shabbos and yom tov
constitute "<i>kedusha achas</i>"or "<i>shtei kedushos</i>"may depend upon the nature and scope of the permit to
perform food related activities ("<i>meleches ochel nefesh</i>") on
<i>yom tov</i>. The Rambam (Hilchos Eruvin 8:10) relates that when the calendar
was fixed on the basis of lunar sightings, Yom Kippur could theoretically fall
on a Friday or Sunday (in the current calendrical system, such an occurrence is
impossible). In such a situation, the two days would be considered like a
single day - "<i>kedusha achas.</i>" The Maggid Mishneh explains
that this relationship is due to <i>Shabbos</i> and <i>Yom Kippur</i>'s
equal level of prohibited <i>melachot</i> - both <i>Shabbos</i> and <i>Yom
Kippur</i> grant no permit for food related activities. The Ran in <i>Beitzah</i>
(22a in Rif, s.v. <i>Ashkachan</i>) echoes a similar sentiment as well. The
Rambam and the Ran thus reveal a critical principle: the status of "<i>kedusha
achas</i>" or "<i>shtei
kedushos</i>"depends on
whether or not the two days share identical prohibited <i>melachot</i>. The
question that remains, then, is whether <i>Shabbos</i> and yom tov actually
share an identical set of <i>melachot</i> or not.</p>



<P>There is three-way argument
regarding the scope and nature of the permissibility of <i>meleches ochel nefesh</i>
on <i>yom tov</i>. The <i>Mishnah</i> in <i>Beitzah</i> (23b) teaches that one
may not trap fish on yom tov. Rashi (s.v. <i>ein</i>) explains that this form
of trapping is prohibited, even though it is<i> meleches ochel nefesh</i>,
because one could have trapped the fish before yom tov. Apparently, Rashi holds
that<i> meleches ochel nefesh</i> only permits doing a melacha that could not
have been done before yom tov. This limitation implies that the nature of the <i>heter</i>
of<i> ochel nefesh</i> is not carte-blanche, categorical permissibility, but
rather, a limited dispensation to perform activities which are absolutely and
unavoidably necessary for yom tov. The <i>Achronim</i> refer to this restricted
permit as "<i>dichui</i>" - literally, "pushed aside."
That is, on yom tov, all thirty nine <i>melachos</i> of <i>Shabbos</i> exist on
yom tov as well, but extenuating circumstances (things which could not be
performed the day before) allow for overriding these prohibitions for the sake
of <i>yom tov</i>.</p>



<P>Tosafos (ibid 3a s.v. <i>gizerah</i>),
however, disagree with Rashi's limited dispensation. They argue that <i>meleches
ochel nefesh</i> is permitted on <i>yom tov</i>, even if one could have easily
completed the <i>melacha</i> before yom tov. The Ran (12a in Rif, s.v. <i>ein</i>)
agrees with Tosafos as well. Tosafos and the Ran thus appear to maintain a
broader, more generous understanding of the Torah's permit to perform<i> meleches
ochel nefesh</i>. As opposed to merely "pushing aside" the
prohibitions of food preparation in a limited fashion (<i>dichui</i>), the
preparation of food on yom tov is absolutely permissible, a term referred to by
the <i>Achronim</i> as "<i>hutra</i>".</p>



<P>The Ramban goes a step further:
not only is <i>meleches ochel nefesh</i> absolutely permitted (<i>hutra</i>) on
<i>yom tov</i>, it was never even prohibited to begin with. According to Rashi,
Tosafos, and the Ran, the list of prohibited <i>melachos</i> on <i>Shabbos</i>
is identical to the list of prohibited <i>melachos</i> on <i>yom tov</i>. In
their eyes, the only difference between <i>Shabbos</i> and <i>yom tov</i> is
that on <i>yom tov</i>, we have a right to override some of these prohibited <i>melachos</i>
for the sake of food preparation (Rashi merely debates Tosafos and the Ran
regarding the extent of this "overriding"). In the Ramban's
eyes, however, the list of prohibited <i>melachos</i> on yom tov is
fundamentally different from the list of prohibited <i>melachos</i> on <i>Shabbos</i>.
When a person performs an act of food preparation on yom tov, he is not
overriding a prohibition; he is rather performing an activity that was never
prohibited in the first place. The Ramban (<i>Vayikra</i> 23:7) proves this distinction
from a close reading of the Torah's wording. Regarding <i>Shabbos</i>,
the Torah prohibits the performance of "<i>Kol melacha</i>" - all
types of labor. Regarding yom tov, however, the Torah only prohibits "<i>meleches
avodah"</i>- laborious
work. The Ramban explains that "<i>meleches avodah"</i>refers to <i>melacha</i> which brings no
pleasure - i.e., <i>melacha</i> not performed for the sake of food preparation.
If, however, one is engaged in "<i>meleches hana'ah</i>,"
pleasurable food preparation, one is not violating any prohibition whatsoever.
Thus, argues the Ramban, the <i>melachos</i> involved in food preparation were
never prohibited by the Torah (see also <i>Milchamos Hashem</i> Beitzah 13a in Rif).</p>



<P>A practical ramification between
the Ran and the Ramban may emerge with regard to one who performs <i>melachos</i>
for the sake of food which are not permitted. Although most food-preparation
activities are permitted on yom tov, certain food-related <i>melachos</i> such
as harvesting and grinding peppers are nonetheless prohibited. The Ran (<i>Beitzah</i>
12a in Rif, s.v. <i>ein</i>) and the Ramban argue as to whether or not these
prohibitions are Biblical or Ravnic. According to the Ran, these prohibitions
are merely Ravnic. According to the Ramban, however, one who performs such
activities violates a Biblical prohibition.</p>



<P>Perhaps this dispute is a
function of their understanding of the permit <i>meleches ochel nefesh</i> on <i>yom
tov</i>. According to the Ramban, there is no "permit" of Ochel Nefesh.
Rather, certain activities fall into the category of "<i>meleches avodah"</i> and are prohibited, and other activities
fall into the category of "<i>meleches hana'ah</i>" and were
never prohibited to begin with. Thus, if a <i>melacha</i> is not labeled as
"<i>meleches hana'ah</i>," it is by default Biblically
prohibited. According to the Ran, however, the Torah provides a general
"permit" of "<i>hutra"</i> across the board to override all food-related prohibitions,
and the Ravs determined which <i>melachos</i> should and should not be
included in this permit. Thus, one who performs a <i>melacha</i> for the sake
of food can only be violating a Ravnic prohibition.</p>



<P>Perhaps one can understand the
disagreement between Rabbah and Rav Chisda in light of this background. Citing
the aforementioned <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (<i>Hilchos Eruvin</i> 8:10), Rav Hershel
Schachter (<i>Eretz HaTzvi</i> 9: 4) explains that whether <i>Shabbos</i> and <i>yom
tov</i> constitute "<i>kedusha achas</i>" or "<i>shtei kedushos</i> depends on the argument
between the Ramban and the Ran. Rav Chisda, who holds that <i>Shabbos</i> and <i>yom
tov</i> constitute "<i>kedusha achas</i>," would agree with the Ran. In essence, <i>Shabbos</i>
and <i>yom tov</i> share the same set of prohibited <i>melachos</i>. <i>Yom tov</i>
merely bears a special dispensation to sometimes override these <i>melachos</i>
for the sake of food preparation. This dispensation could perhaps be analogized
to the dispensation of <i>pikuach nefesh</i> - matters of life and death - on Shabbos.
Although the permit of <i>pikuach nefesh</i> overrides the <i>Shabbos</i>, it
does not alter the essential identity of the <i>melachos</i>. Given their
essential equality of <i>melachos</i>, <i>Shabbos</i> and yom tov constitute a "<i>kedusha
achas</i>."Rabbah, however,
would likely hold like the Ramban: fundamentally, <i>Shabbos</i> and yom tov
have entirely different sets of <i>melachos</i>, and therefore constitute two
independent <i>kedushos</i>.</p>



<P>Rav Schachter adds that this
explanation may further elucidate the argument between Rabbah and Rav Chisda
regarding the principle of "<i>ho'eel</i>." In accepting the
principle of "<i>ho'eel</i>," Rabbah entirely ignores the
intent of an individual: even if a person expressly intended to cook for after yom
tov, the <i>halacha</i> "pretends" that he is truly cooking for the
sake of potential guests on yom tov. Rav Chisda, however, rejects "<i>ho'eel</i>,"
presumably because he perceives the person's intent as critical. Why,
then, does Rabbah disregard the actual intent of the individual, while Rav Chisda
requires it?</p>



<P>Perhaps this dispute is further
consistent with the above analysis. The <i>Gemarah</i> (<i>Yevamos</i> 64a)
teaches that whenever a prohibition is <i>overridden</i>, one must have intent
to override it. For example, if a person spreads out a fishing net on <i>Shabbos</i>
intending to catch fish (a Biblically prohibited activity), and completely
unintentionally, his net retrieves and saves the life of a drowning baby, the
person is nonetheless liable for violating the <i>Shabbos</i>. Although he
ultimately did perform an act of "<i>pikuach nefesh</i>" which
normally overrides the <i>Shabbos</i>, "<i>pikuach nefesh</i>" can
only override the <i>Shabbos</i> if an individual <i>intends </i>for it to do
so. Thus, if the permit of <i>ochel nefesh</i> is "overriding" the
prohibition of <i>melacha</i> on yom tov, as the Ran maintains, one's
intent is critical. Thus, Rav Chisda, who sides with the Ran, requires proper
intent and dismisses the principle of "<i>ho'eel</i>." If,
however, <i>ochel nefesh</i> activities were never prohibited to begin with, no
"overriding" is occurring. Rather, one is permitting an activity
that is fundamentally permitted, much like drinking water or taking a nap.
Because there is no trace of a prohibition in this activity, a person's
mindset is irrelevant. Hence, Rabbah, who holds like the Ramban that food
preparation activities were never prohibited on yom tov to begin with, can
accept the principle of "<i>ho'eel</i>."</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The Navi Zechariah (8:19) promises that four fast days will
in the future be transformed to holidays. The fast of the tenth month, namely <i>Asarah
B' Teves</i>, the day which commemorates the siege that Nebuchadnezzar,
king of Babylonia lay to Jerusalem (586 BCE), which marked the beginning of the
end of the first <i>Bais HaMikdash,</i> will in the future become a day of
celebration. </p>

<P>The Avudraham in his commentary on the <i>siddur</i> writes
a fascinating <i>halacha</i>. He says that the <i>Navi</i> Yechezkel (24:2),
who instructed the Jewish community in <i>Bavel</i> where he was exiled from Eretz
<i>Yisrael</i>, to write "<i>b'etzem hayom hazeh</i>"- to
note with precision and surety that on this day- the Tenth of <i>Teves</i>- the
siege was placed around Jerusalem. Because the <i>Navi</i> uses this expression
several times we are to learn the importance of fasting precisely on that day.
It is for this reason that <i>Asarah B'Teves</i> is the only fast that
can fall on a Friday and indeed we fast on <i>Erev Shabbos</i>. The remarkable
teaching of the Avudraham is that were this fast to occur on a <i>Shabbos</i>,
we would fast on <i>Shabbos</i> as well. </p>

<P>At first glance this seems rather startling. True, the
Ravs orchestrated the calendar that the tenth of <i>Teves</i> cannot occur on
a <i>Shabbos</i>. But what is it about this day, wherein lies its significance
that it would join <i>Yom Kippur</i> which is the only fast that the Jewish
people fast on <i>Shabbos</i>?&nbsp; </p>

<P>The Chasam Sofer <i>zt"l</i> in his commentary on the <i>slichos</i>
for <i>Asarah</i> <i>B'Teves</i> provides an insightful explanation of
the Avudraham. He reminds us that what transpires here on earth is a reflection
of what is transpiring in heaven. The siege of Bavel was indeed to serve as a
wake-up call to the Jewish nation to reflect upon the possibility that they
might lose the <i>Bais HaMikdash</i>. On high, the Heavenly Court was called
into session to determine if the <i>Bais HaMikdash</i> would indeed be
destroyed. Moreover, annually, writes the Chasam Sofer zt"l, on every <i>Asarah
B'Teves</i> the <i>Bais Din Shel Maalah</i> is convened to decide if the
third <i>Bais HaMikdash</i> will be built this year or Heaven Forbid postponed.
</p>

<P>There are two models of mourning. The first is called <i>aveilus
yeshana</i>- a mourning for a historical phenomenon that affected us adversely
in the past<i>. Tisha B'Av</i> is just such an occurrence. For an <i>aveilus
yeshana</i> we do not fast on <i>Shabbos</i>. Thus when <i>Tisha B'Av</i>
falls on <i>Shabbos </i>we fast on Sunday. Those who have the practice of
fasting on a <i>yahrzeit </i>do not fast on a <i>Shabbos</i>, as that too is
commemorating an <i>aveilus yeshana</i>.</p>

<P>However, there is also a model of <i>aveilus chadasha</i>,
meaning a present or contemporary mourning. If one has a <i>chalom rah</i> (a disturbing
dream) on Friday night, the <i>halacha</i> (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 220:5) allows
the individual to fast on <i>Shabbos</i> since for them there is an immediate
crisis and fasting would often be a greater personal <i>oneg </i>(pleasure) than
partaking of the <i>Shabbos</i> meals. Similarly, with the insight of the Chasam
Sofer, the Heavenly Deliberations on <i>Asarah B'Teves</i> designates
this fast as not only historical and commemorative, but creating a national
crisis, inspiring us to storm the Heavenly Court with our fasting and prayers. </p>

<P>The urgency and immediacy of <i>Asarah B'Teves</i> may
further be gleaned from the teaching of the <i>Yerushalmi</i> (<i>Yuma</i> 1:1)
that "any generation that did not build the <i>Bais HaMikdash</i> in its
day- it is as if it were destroyed in its generation". The Sfas Emes
explains that there have been many generations of righteous individuals such as
<i>Tanaiim </i>and <i>Amoraim</i>, the <i>chachamim</i> of the Talmud and still
the Temple has not been built. He explains, based upon <i>Tehillim</i> (147:2)
"<i>boneh Yerushalayim Hashem</i> - Hashem builds Jerusalem",
meaning it is a process and every generation must contribute its share of
building the third <i>Bais HaMikdash</i> by proving its worthiness of the
Divine dwelling literally in its midst. <i>Asarah B'Teves</i> is our
appearance before the Heavenly Court, hence we would fast on a <i>Shabbos</i>. </p>

<P>Finally, the <i>Seder Hadoros</i> sees Nebuchadnezzar as the
<i>gilgul </i>and direct descendant of Nimrod. Nimrod led the construction of <i>migdal
Bavel</i>, which is understood by <i>Chazal</i> (<i>Tanchuma Noach</i> 24) as a
direct attack on G-d. The goal was (<i>Beraishis</i> 11:4) "let us make a
name for ourselves", i.e. place man at the center of the universe, not
any Divine Being. He attempts to dominate the public mindset by casting Avraham,
his vocal opponent, into the fire. Avraham, as we know, is miraculously saved. </p>

<P>Nimrod's direct descendant, Nebuchadnezzar, likewise
wishes to destroy the <i>Bais HaMikdash</i>. The daily functioning of the Temple
accompanied by the ten miracles (as found in <i>Avos</i> 5:7) proclaimed to the
world the existence and directorship of Hashem over all. G-d was recognized as
the center of the world. Like Nimrod, this was challenged by Nebuchadnezar. He
too cast Chananya, Mishael and Azariah into the furnace and they too, loyal
descendants of Avraham, were miraculously saved. He too wanted to place man at
the center of the universe. </p>

<P><i>Asarah B' Teves</i> thus invites all proud
descendants of Avraham, and the many myriads throughout Jewish history who
sacrificed their lives for the sake of Hashem, to bolster their living a life
of <i>Kiddush Hashem</i>- sanctifying G-d's name , thereby contributing
their share to the building of the Third Temple. Perhaps in contrast to the
length of the fast, a day fast as opposed to 25 hours, <i>Asarah B'Teves</i>
is called a minor fast, but in reality we know better.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>
The wise King Solomon in <i>Mishlei</i> (3:17)
informs us that "its ways are ways of pleasentness and all its paths are
peace". I'd like to share several insightful observations of our <i>Chazal</i>
as to just how pleasant and sensitive is our holy Torah. </p>

<P>
In the opening part of <i>Parshas Noach, </i>Hashem informs Noach
of the impending almost total destruction and the remnant that will be spared
and perpetuated via the ark. Eight humans were invited to enter the ark, and a
pair of species of the wide variety of the animal kingdom that successfully
passed the &#8216;moral detector' of the ark were also invited. These
animals came miraculously on their own to perpetuate their species after the
flood, and Noach did not have to tRavel to great distances or exhibit prowess
in hunting them.</p>

<P>
Then the Torah teaches that Hashem tells Noach (7:2) "<i>tikach
lecha</i>&#8230;"- you are to take seven pairs of every clean animal. Hashem
does not tell Noach why he is to take these additional animals, later to be
pronounced kosher to the Jewish People (<i>Zevachim</i> 116A). The <i>Medrash</i>
(<i>Braishis Rabbah</i> 34:9) tells us that Noach on his own reasoned that
their purpose was for offerings. What is fascinating, notes the Ramban in 6:20, is
that these clean animals Noach had to hunt and bring himself to the ark, and
they did not participate in the incredible Divinely orchestrated parade of all
other animals into the ark. The reason being that those whose purpose was pure
physical salvation were invited and assisted by Hashem in coming to the ark.
The other seven pairs that were to be offered on the altar, Hashem did not
bring them to the slaughter, rather Noach had to take the initiative, for after
all this was for his benefit.</p>

<P>
It is exciting to note that the effect of these offerings
was most positive and beneficial to mankind. Following his offering them (8:41)
"Hashem smelled the pleasing aroma and said &#8216;I will not continue to
curse again the earth because of man'". Moreover, Noach's
taking them on the ark extended their lives by a year. Still, because of their
ultimate end - being slaughtered- Noach had to take the initiative. (The Ramban
suggests a second reason and that is to enable Noach to gain more out of the
mitzvah of offering these animals by involving him in the <i>tircha</i>-
preparation- or <i>hechsher mitzvah</i>.)</p>

<P>
It is interesting to note that the Meshech Chochma in <i>Parshas
Noach</i> (9:7) comments on the command to Noach and his sons of "<i>Peru
urevu</i>"- the mitzvah of procreation- that this is the source of the
Talmudic teaching (<i>Yevamos</i> 64b) that man is commanded with the first
mitzvah of the Torah - procreation; and not woman. The Rambam in the
beginning of chapter 15 of the laws of <i>Ishus</i> codifies this as law. The Meshech
Chochma explains that in chapter 1 in <i>Beraishis</i> when Hashem blesses the
first couple and directs them to be fruitful and multiply, that is before the
sin of eating from the forbidden fruit and its consequence of "<i>b'etsev
taldei banim</i>"- in pain shall you give birth. Having undergone this
change in nature, the Torah which personifies "<i>dracheha darchei noam</i>"-
its paths are paths of pleasantness- could not and does not legislate to
womankind that she subject herself to a painful situation of childbirth. </p>

<P>
The Meshech Chochma further suggests that the Torah, whose
ways are pleasant, only imposes one fast day- <i>Yom Kippur</i> - during the
entire year. Moreover, it legislates as a caring mother that we eat in
preparation for the fast on the day preceding the fast (not leaving it to
chance or probability). </p>

<P>
Continuing this theme of sensitivity we (Ashkenazic Jewry
outside of Israel) do not recite the <i>bracha</i> of <i>Shehecheyanu</i>
at the occasion of a <i>bris milah</i>. Despite the fact that the Talmud (<i>Shabbos</i>
130a) attributes the verse from <i>Tehillim</i> (119:162) "<i>Suss anochi
al imrasecha k'motzei shalal Rav</i>- I rejoice over your word
(commandment) as one who finds abundant spoils" to refer to the mitzvah
of <i>milah,</i> thus teaching us that aside from the criteria of a <i>mitzvah</i>
that is performed from time to time, or certainly if this is the first child
that the father is circumcising the blessing <i>Shehechyanu</i> should be
recited as found in Ramah <i>Yoreh Deah</i> (28:2) that the first time one
performs a <i>mitzvah</i> <i>Shehecheyanu</i> is said. The answer is provided
by the Meiri (Shabbos) that since the baby experiences pain (<i>tza'ar d'yinukah</i>)
no <i>Shehecheyanu </i>is recited. Similarly, as a display of sensitivity to
the discomfort of the baby- the Talmud <i>Kesubos</i> (8a) teaches that we do
not include "<i>sheha simcha b'm'ono</i>"- included at
the Grace After Meals during the week of <i>sheva berachos</i>, following the <i>bris</i>.
</p>

<P>
The book of <i>Beraishis</i> is referred to in the Talmud (<i>Avodah

because of the <i>Avos</i>- the Patriarchs- who lived s life of <i>yashrus</i>,

<P>Immediately,
upon hearing the dreadful report of the spies, Calev silenced the
people, and proclaimed assuredly &ldquo;<I>oloh na-aleh</I>&rdquo;-
we shall surely ascend and conquer the land (<I>Bamidbar</I> 13:30).
Rashi adds that the double language &ldquo;shall surely ascend&rdquo;
connotes even if it means to the heavens. Were Moshe to ask us to
make ladders and go up there (to the heavens) we would succeed in
following him. 
</P>
<P>The
Admor of Ostrovtza z&rdquo;l sees an additional deeper meaning than
following Moshe blindly even to the heavens. It is not only that
Moshe earned our trust by his past performances and accomplishments
of splitting the sea, and bringing down the <I>mun</I>, but Moshe as
<I>Rabbeinu</I>- our teacher par excellence- is showing how we could
ascend to the heavens, by building ladders and going up step by step.
The Torah is teaching us often there are no short cuts to success.
One has to progress slowly, gradually and with focus. 
</P>
<P>The
<I>mishnah </I>(<I>Keilim
</I>1:6-9) teaches that there are ten levels of <I>kedusha</I>-
sanctity- associated with the Land of Israel. While the literal
understanding of the <I>mishnah</I> refers to geographic locations
within <I>Eretz Yisroel</I> and the <I>Bais HaMikdash</I>, this
certainly may be applied to different aspects of <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>.
The Talmud (<I>Kesubos</I>
111A) teaches that if one walks 4 cubits (6 feet) in <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>
he has earned (thereby) a share in the World to Come. One could only
imagine the significance and higher rung for one who lives in the
land, earns his livelihood in the land, contributes to the welfare of
the land and fulfills the <I>mitzvah</I> of <I>yishuv ha'aretz.</I></P>
<P>The
land contains plentiful rungs. The Tur (ch. 208) cites that his
father the Rosh omitted in the &ldquo;<I>Al HaMichya</I>&rdquo;
blessing the phrase &ldquo;<I>v&rsquo;nochal mipirya</I>&rdquo;- that
we may eat of the fruit of the Land of Israel. The Talmud (<I>Sotah</I>
14A) states that Moshe did not wish to enter the land to eat of its
fruit, but rather he cRaved to perform the <I>mitzvos </I>that can
only be fulfilled in the land. The Rosh therefore omitted  &ldquo;<I>v&rsquo;nochal
mipirya</I>&rdquo;. The Bach says we are to recite it, as indeed, the
fruit of the Land of Israel contains <I>kedusha</I>- sanctity. 
</P>
<P>There
are many rungs to the redemptive process. The Talmud (<I>Sanhedrin</I>
98A) teaches in the name of Rabi Abba that there is no greater
indication of the end of the Exile and beginning of Redemption than
the Land of Israel producing and yielding fruit in abundance in
preparation of the return of the Jewish People to its land. This is
the first rung and we <I>b&rsquo;ezras Hashem</I> have seen with our
own eyes this incredible phenomenon, both in the positive harvesting
throughout the land and the refusal of the land to yield produce to
its enemies. 
</P>
<P>Thus,
the <I>minyan </I>of spies that demoralized the nation are defied by
Calev and the metaphor of the ladder. Yes, there are challenges and
crises to be met and encountered, but step by step, rung by rung, we
can prevail. Why? Because &ldquo;<I>asher barah Elokim la&rsquo;asos</I>&rdquo;
(<I>Braishis</I> 2:3) - He abstained on <I>Shabbos</I> from all His
work which G-d created to do. The last two words are an invitation to
man to initiate- to do, and then He will assist and complete the
efforts of man. We have to build the ladder and begin ascending. But
then He takes us to the top. To cite Rashi (<I>Bamidbar</I> 3:16):
Hashem said to Moshe &ldquo;you do yours and I will do Mine.&rdquo;
If need be we can ascend to the heavens if not beyond!</P>
<P>It
is interesting to note that this directive to ascend to the heavens
is found a second time in the Torah at the end of Moshe&rsquo;s
oration in the book of <I>Devarim</I>. Moshe declares (30:12) &ldquo;it
(the Torah) is not in heaven.&rdquo; Rashi directs you to the Talmud
(<I>Eruvin</I> 55A) that teaches that &ldquo;if it were in the
heavens, you would be required to go up in pursuit of it.&rdquo; Once
again the image of ladders and rungs comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>The
Medrash (<I>Devarim Rabbah</I> 8:3) commenting on the verse in
Proverbs (24:7) &ldquo;wisdom is too lofty for a fool, he does not
open his mouth at the gate,&rdquo; explains that a fool enters the
study hall and inquires how one can participate in the discussion. He
is told: first one studies the Hebrew language, then Chumash, then
the Prophets, then Scriptures, then the Mishnah, then the Talmud,
then the codified laws, then the philosophy of Torah. Upon hearing
this seemingly colossal assignment of prerequisites, the fool
declares: &ldquo;when can I ever succeed in mastering the above?&rdquo;And
he leaves the study hall frustrated and dejected. Hence the latter
half of the above cited verse &ldquo;he does not open his mouth at
the gate&rdquo;. The wise individual studies one letter a day, one
verse a day, one <I>mishnah</I>, one <I>blatt</I>, one <I>siman</I>
until he is most capable of partaking in the discussion in the study
hall. The image of the ladder conveys not only the resolve of the Jew
to study Torah, because of which he would even pursue it to the
heavens. But in addition, the method by which he acquires Torah is
rung by rung. 
</P>
<P>Here
too, as with <I>Eretz Yisroel</I>, Hashem says you do yours and I
will do Mine. Rav Moshe Shapira <I>shlita</I> conveyed the message of
<I>Sefiras</I> <I>HaOmer</I> (counting the <I>Omer</I>) in the
following way: The Torah ordains (<I>Vayikra</I> 23:16) &ldquo;<I>tisperu
chamishim yom</I>- you shall count fifty days&rdquo;. In reality, we
only count seven weeks, or forty nine days. However, there are fifty rungs of purity
and a similar number of impurity. Part of the haste in leaving Egypt,
explain the commentaries, is that Israel had fallen to the forty
ninth rung of impurity, and thus needed to be expelled from there.
Similarly, there are fifty levels of knowledge and a corresponding
number of ignorance. The maximum that man can attain on his own is
the forty ninth rung of knowledge insight and  understanding. Hashem
says you count forty nine days, prepare yourselves for the humanly
impossible and I will share with you a taste of Torah, a part of the
fiftieth. We do ours, we are to climb the spiritual ladder of Torah,
and He takes us over the top. 
</P>
<P>Finally,
there is a third area that I believe the imagery of the ladder and
ascending rungs is applicable. The Talmud (<I>Brachos</I> 5A) teaches
in the name of R&rsquo; Shimon Bar Yochai &ldquo;the Holy One Blessed
Be He gave three good gifts to Israel, and He gave them only through
suffering&rdquo;. They are Torah, the Land of Israel, and the World
to Come. <I>Olam HaBa </I>- the World to Come &ndash; is reached rung
by rung. 
</P>
<P>The
Talmud (<I>Avodah Zarah</I> 18A) tells of the tragic death of Rabi
Chanina ben Tradyon. The Romans (<I>yimach shemam</I>) brought the
Rav wrapped in a <I>Sefer</I> Torah, encircled them with bundles of
vine shoots and set them on fire. As the fire continued to rage, the
(Roman) executioner asked R&rsquo; Chanina, &ldquo;if I increase the
flame and remove the tufts of wool from your heart (that his killers
had placed to prolong his agony and death), will you bring me with
you to the life of the World to Come?&rdquo; R&rsquo; Chanina
answered yes. The executioner insisted that the Rav swear, and he
did. He immediately increased the flame and removed the tufts of wool
from Rabi Chanina&rsquo;s heart and the latter&rsquo;s soul departed
more quickly. Then the executioner jumped and fell into the fire,
whereupon a heavenly voice issued forth and proclaimed &ldquo;Rabi
Chanina and the executioner have been readied for the World to Come&rdquo;.
When Rebbi heard of the above he cried and declared &ldquo;there are
those who acquire their place in the World to Come in a single
moment, and those who acquire their share in <I>Olam HaBa</I> through
years of spiritual striving and accomplishments.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Aside
from the literal understanding of Rebbi&rsquo;s teaching, one may
understand it to mean Rebbi cried for if one can acquire a share in
<I>Olam HaBa</I> in a single moment with a single act, how much more
could that person have attained with many noble acts? <I>Olam HaBa</I>
is acquired rung by rung. 
</P>
<P>The
levels of the World to Come are featured in the blessing a Jew
recites after an <I>aliyah</I> to the Torah. He thanks Hashem for
giving us a Torah of truth and &ldquo;<I>v&rsquo;chayay olam nata
b&rsquo;socheinu</I>&rdquo;- and for implanting eternal life within
us. The word &ldquo;<I>chayay</I>&rdquo; in the plural denotes rungs
or measures of accomplishments and commensurate rewards. 
</P>
<P>Finally,
the Talmud (<I>Megillah</I> 28B) teaches he who studies Torah laws
every day has the assurance that he will be in the World to Come. The
daily prescription of study reflecting the rung by rung approach is
the assured method of acquisition. 
</P>
<P><I>Eretz
Yisroel</I>, Torah and <I>Olam HaBa</I> share the common trait of
being this worldly, but because they possess a special infusion of
the Divine, by nature they appear to be most difficult and
challenging for mortal man. Calev in <I>Parshas Shelach</I> teaches
the formula for success in all three- proceed rung by rung and Hashem
completes the ascent.</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: shmini]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The
day that was crowned with 10 crowns (<i>Shabbos</i> 89b) arrived. The long awaited
and anticipated day of dedication of the <i>Mishkan</i> - <i>Rosh Chodesh Nisan</i>
- the day the <i>Shechinah</i> moved into the community. The opening verse of <i>Parshas
Shmini</i> informs us that Moshe summoned the <i>Kohanim</i> - Aharon and
his sons, as well as the <i>ziknei Yisroel</i> (elders of Israel). The
<i>Kohanim</i> are necessary to officiate over the <i>Korbanos</i> for this
occasion. What is the purpose of gathering the elders? Why the need for a
distinguished dais to be present? At first glance, they were but spectators -
onlookers like the rest of the Jewish nation. Rav Yoseif Salant <i>z"l</i>
(in Be'air Yoseif) suggests a profound explanation. The nation was to
inaugurate the sanctuary by first atoning for its major historical
transgressions. Thus they were to bring to a <i>se'er ezim</i> (he goat) to
atone for the sin of the sale of Yoseif. After selling Yoseif the brothers
slaughtered a goat and attempted to convince their father that Yoseif had been
devoured by a wild animal (<i>Tanchuma</i>, <i>Shmini</i> 3). <i>Bnai Yisroel</i>
were further instructed to take a calf for an <i>olah</i> (burnt offering) to
atone for the sin of the Golden Calf (Ibid 4). Before we begin a new slate and
a new page in our glorious history, the Jewish people, one organic whole, past
present and future, have to rectify the past. </P>



<P>There
was a common denominator at the root of these two major sins. In both
situations, the participants, the sinners, believed they were right and
justified in their actions and they failed to consult with their elders to gain
their approval and approbation. The brothers of Yoseif believed that Yoseif had
the status of a <i>Rodef</i> (Sforno) - one who is pursuing others threatening
to kill or harm them. They convened a court and pronounced their brother
guilty. Their error lay in the fact that their grandfather Yitzchak was still
alive and Shem and Ever were still functioning as a fount of knowledge, and the
brothers should have consulted them. Similarly, Moshe, prior to ascending to Mount Sinai,
deputizes Aharon and Chor (<i>Shemos</i> 24:14) in his absence, should a crisis
develop. A catastrophe occurred! The people believed Moshe was dead and the way
the Ramban understands the subsequent developments, they were not looking for
idolatry but rather a replacement for Moshe. Once again, their motives might
have been pure, but not only did they not consult the elders or Aharon and Chur,
they rejected them. They killed Chur when he tried to stop them from making a
golden calf, and Aharon chose the lesser of two evils by cooperating with the
people (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 7B-8A).</P>



<P>The
Jew looks backward to move forward. Interestingly, this is based on the verse (<i>Devarim</i>)
"Ask your father and he will tell you; your elders and they will guide
you". Moshe invites the elders to sit at the dais at the dedication of
the <i>Mishkan</i> ceremonies, to highlight their importance, and to convey the
message to the nation: as a bird cannot fly without wings, the Jewish people,
taught Rav Akiva (<i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 11:8), cannot advance without their
elders. </P>



<P>How
appropriate and necessary is this teaching especially for our days. It is
frustrating to note that the smallest section of Igros Moshe (the response of Rav
Moshe Feinstein z"l) is <i>Chosen Mishpat</i>. The reason is obvious;
people don't ask questions regarding business practices. Rav Moshe is
further known to have regretted the paucity of inquiries regarding priorities
of <i>tzedakeh</i>, and which school parents should send their children to. When
it comes to the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>peru u'revu</i>, whether to have more children or not is more important than what to
name a child, and too often inquiries are of the latter not the former. For so
many of the sandwich generation, the privilege of having elderly parents and
children - both require time, effort and resources - is not only trying, but
often <i>halachically</i> challenging. Finally, parenting - when to be firm and
when to be flexible - is also an area where guidance should be sought. These
are but a few of the areas where we need our elders to guide us.</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: shoftim]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>
The opening <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>parshas Shoftim</i>
mandates that courts of law be established throughout the land. That same verse
directs the judges to execute "<i>mishpat tzedek</i>"- righteous
judgment. Judges are then further instructed not to pervert judgment, to not
show any favoritism to a litigant by giving him preferential treatment, and to
not take a bribe. Then the Torah seems to be repeating itself again when it
says (16:20) <i>tzedek tzedek tirdof</i>- righteousness righteousness shall you
pursue". Rav Ashi in <i>Sanhedrin</i> (32A) understood the repetition of
the word righteousness to teach that circumstances might warrant different
"righteous" approaches. There are instances in which the course of
righteousness is to pursue justice, <i>din</i>, and other circumstances in
which righteousness dictates we pursue compromise, <i>psharah</i>. In addition,
the Talmud (ibid) understands "<i>tzedek tzedek tirdof</i>" as an
instruction to seek out the best court available.</p>

<P>
The Dubner Maggid in his <i>Ohel Yaakov</i> (<i>parshas Mishpatim</i>)
has a novel understanding of "<i>tzedek tzedek tirdof</i>". Rather
than understand the teaching as addressing judges, he learns the verse as a
directive to each individual that in their personal and business affairs they
are to be scrupulously careful to ensure that what is theirs is really theirs.
In fact, he questions the nature of the <i>dinei </i>Torah that arose in the <i>midbar</i>
and suggests that unlike most court cases, in which each individual claims
rights and possession, here they were asking the judges to verify and ensure
their rightful claim of ownership, with each one saying ,"No! Maybe it is
yours".</p>

<P>
There is a delicious <i>Medrash</i> (<i>Vayikra Rabbah</i>
27:1) that illustrates this idea. The <i>Medrash</i> teaches that Alexander the
Great once visited the community of Afriki and wished to observe its judicial
system. Two men came before the king for justice. The first said, "I
purchased a plot of land from this man, and when I dug to lay the foundation of
a home, I found a treasure buried there. I only bought the land, not the
treasure, therefore it is not mine." The seller said, "I too am
fearful of the biblical prohibition of &#8216;<i>lo tigzo</i>"- do not
steal' and I too do not want it back unless it is definitely mine."
The king (judge) asked the buyer if he had a son, he answered
"yes". The seller answered positively to having a daughter.
"Wonderful," said the king, "let them marry and share the
treasure." This is "<i>tzedek tzedek tirdof</i>"- affirming
with certainty that what's yours is really yours. </p>

<P>
The Arizal was known to have the ability to identify sins
and transgressions of individuals by looking carefully into their face. The Rav
of Tzfas, Rav Moshe Galante (1540-1614) once came to the Arizal for his
"spiritual check-up", whereupon the latter said "you have <i>safek
gezel</i>"- literally you are suspected of thievery/ borderline theft.
The Rav who had a silk business fasted, cried. He then called in all his
workers, put a pile of money on the table, and asked if he had cheated any of
them. They all answered in the negative and left. The last to leave, a woman,
took a few coins. When the Rav / employer asked why she took the money, she
answered "you paid me as a regular worker, and I am a specialist."
The Rav cried for joy that his record was now cleaned. He was able to say
about himself "<i>tzedek tzedek tirdof</i>".</p>

<P>
The internet can be a wonderful tool to use, but it is also
subject to much abuse. Too many are guilty of pirating information that is
copyrighted from the internet. Rav Moshe Feinstein <i>zt"l</i> said it is
not permitted to copy any item that is being sold by the creator (maker) of
that item. Every time one copies it, they are taking away sales from him.
"Everyone does it and it really should be permitted (<i>mutar</i>)"-
in no way justifies it.</p>

<P>
Our children must be taught the definition of plagiarizing
and the prohibition thereof. Again, the internet contains much scholarly
material. It is also an opportunity to bring much <i>geulah</i> to the world-
by giving proper credit to the author and earning the approbation of "<i>tzedek
tzedek tirdof</i>".</p>

<P>
Applying for scholarships from <i>yeshivot</i> when one
doesn't need it (this is often done by hiding income), is stealing from <i>tzedakah</i>,
and the practical consequences of not getting a scholarship when one truly
needs it, is because of a lack of "<i>tzedek tzedek tirdof</i>".</p>

<P>
It is not sufficient to be careful about eating <i>glatt
kosher</i>, our money has to be <i>glatt yashar</i>.</p>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Benjamin Yudin]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2009]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: yisro]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The <i>parsha</i> begins by telling us that Yisro heard.
What did he hear? Rashi cites the opinions of Rebbi Eliezer and Rebbi Yehoshua
(<i>Zevachim</i> 116a) that he heard of the splitting of the Red Sea and the
war with Amalek, and this caused him to come and convert to Judaism.</p>



<P>At first glance, it is somewhat puzzling that both of these
phenomena contributed to his coming. The splitting of the sea was an
indisputable open miracle while the war with Amalek was fought in a
conventional fashion. In fact, the Torah itself testifies that at times during
the war (when Moshe's hands were down) that Amalek prevailed. What did
the war with Amalek contribute to causing Yisro to come and convert?</p>



<P>The Be'er Yosef (Rav Yosef Salant <i>z'l</i>)
suggests a fascinating insight. The Torah tells us as part of the <i>Shiras
HaYam</i> - the song of praise and exaltation - that the children
of Israel sang to Hashem following their miraculous deliverance, "people
heard and trembled, they were mortified by Israel's ascendancy. All the
inhabitants of Canaan melted in fear of destruction and conquest" (<i>Shemos</i>
 15:14-15).</p>



<P>At this moment in history, the Jewish nation was invincible,
impenetrable. This perception and fear did not last long. When Amalek attacked,
they accomplished "<i>asher korcha</i>" (<i>Devarim</i> 25:18)
which our Ravs understand to mean in addition to &#8216;chancing upon
you,' as &#8216;who cooled you off.' Rashi explains that the pedestal
that the Jewish nation was placed upon as a result of the Splitting of the Sea
was toppled by Amalek. It may be compared to a boiling hot bath into which no
person could descend. One scoundrel came, jumped into it; although he himself
was scolded, he cooled it off for others. Similarly, the luster of the Jewish
people was now diminished.</p>



<P>It is thus these two contrasting events that Yisro heard.
Who is this Yisro? <i>Shemos Rabbah</i> (1:9) teaches that Pharoah has three
advisers who sat on his executive committee, advising him what to do with his
Jewish problem. Bilaam, Iyov (Job), and Yisro. Yisro is a recognized world
leader and adviser. In addition, Yisro is an accomplished theologian who
studied all existing religions of the day, and chose Judaism above all the rest
(<i>Tanchuma</i> Yisro 7). Moreover, the <i>Mechiltah</i> informs us that Yisro
was living in an environment that afforded him much honor and recognition, yet
he abandoned it all to go to the desert, a place of literal desolation, to
study and accept Torah.</p>



<P>The damage done by the war with Amalek, the blow to the
honor and dignity of the fledgling Jewish nation, following miraculous
salvation at the splitting of the Red Sea, was restored by Yisro's
embracing Judaism. The feeling of vulnerability that Israel felt by being
attacked by Amalek was now replaced with greater self confidence and self
esteem by Yisro's choosing on his own to convert to Judaism. Timing is
everything!</p>



<P>This lesson is timeless. At different times there are different
<i>mitzvos</i> and priorities. The Ravs describe the <i>mitzvah</i> of
Moshe's taking the remains of Yosef as they were leaving Egypt as "<i>chacham
lev yikach mitzvos - </i>the wise man busies himself with <i>mitzvos</i>"
(Proverbs 10:7). At first glance, why award Moshe with this special
designation? Were not the rest of the Jewish people involved in the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>bizas Mitzrayim</i>, fulfilling the prophecy to Avraham <i>Avinu</i> that
the slaves will leave with great wealth? The answer is obvious! While Moshe and
<i>Bnei Yisroel</i> were involved with <i>mitzvos</i>, Moshe's were more
demanding, less lucrative, and he seized the moment.</p>



<P>We are living in special and challenging times. We can not
ignore the many who are experiencing economic hardships. A genuine interested
show of concern is a fulfillment of "<i>nosei b'ol im chaveiro</i>"
(<i>Avos</i> 6:6).&nbsp; "Feeling his plight" is a warranted <i>mitzvah</i>
of the day. Increased support of local Torah institutions is especially
necessary to compensate for the many who are presently unable pay their yeshiva
tuition.</p>



<P>Finally, this past week the Jewish world lost a Yisro in the
form of Rav Noach Weinberg, <i>z"l</i>. He, like Yisro, demonstrated
initiative, and at a time when the Jewish nation needed a boost to its morale,
Rav Weinberg created the network of <i>kiruv rechokim</i> throughout the
world. As Yisro of old, he not only restored many to their roots, but the
raised the level of Jewish pride and identity.</p>



<P>May we follow the example of Rav Weinberg, like Yisro
before him, and recognize our opportunities to seize the moment and involve
ourselves in the performance of <i>mitzvos</i>.</p>

		<date><![CDATA[2010]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: 10teves]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>In the introduction to "<i>Ein</i> Yaakov," the
author cites a classic Tannaic dispute pertaining to what constitutes a "<i>klal
gadol baTorah</i> - great rule in the Torah." While Ben Zoma identifies
"S<i>hema Yisroel</i>" as the paradigmatic "<i>klal gadol baTorah</i>",
Ben Nanas cites "<i>v'ahavta l'reacha</i>" and Shimon ben
Pazi quotes "<i>es hakevesh echad ta'aseh baboker</i>". Perhaps
one could suggest that these three opinions reflect the three pillars of the
world described in the <i>Mishnah Avos</i> (1:2): "<i>Shema Yisroel</i>"
refers to the paramount importance of Torah; "<i>es hakevesh echad ta'aseh
baboker</i>" alludes to the <i>Avodah</i>; and "<i>v'ahavta l'reacha</i>"
highlights <i>gemilus chasadim</i>.</p>

<P>While the opinions of Ben Zoma and Ben Nanas are quite
understandable, the citation of Shimon ben Pazi appears to demand explanation. Why
does Shimon ben Pazi overlook broader, more universalistic aphorisms in favor
of a seemingly specific and technical <i>halachah</i> pertaining to the daily <i>Mikdash</i>
service?</p>

<P>Perhaps Shimon ben Pazi is wishes to convey that the foundation
of the Torah rests upon consistency and persistence in the service of <i>HaKadosh
Baruch Hu</i>. Just as the <i>Tamid</i> offering is brought twice daily, day-in
and day-out, our commitment to Torah and <i>mitzvos</i> must always be present,
regardless of emotional reluctance or personal hindrance. Indeed, the <i>Mesillas
Yesharim</i> (chapter 25) teaches that true <i>yiras shamayim</i> can only be
obtained "<i>berov hahasmada baTorah u'deracheha b'li hefsek</i>
- through unwavering commitment to the study of Torah and its ways. Only
through constant contemplation and emulation of the ways of <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i>
can a person truly imprint the seal of <i>Yiras Shamayim</i> upon himself.</p>

<P>Perhaps one could suggest that these three pillars of the
world correspond to a further symbolism as well. The Netziv teaches that the Aron
and the Menorah of the Tabernacle represented the Torah: as the storage site
for the tablets received at <i>Har</i> Sinai, the Aron represented the Written
Torah, while the illumination and clarity produced by the Menorah represented
the Oral Torah (see <i>Berachos</i> 57a and <i>Midrash Rabbah Bereishis</i>
91). As such, these two <i>keilim</i> correspond to the first pillar of the
world. The Rashbatz adds that, as the ultimate site for the offering of
sacrifices, the <i>mizbeach</i> represents <i>avodah</i>, or the second pillar
of the world. Finally, the Ramban (<i>Shemos</i> 25:24) explains that the <i>shulchan</i>
represents the infinite support of <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> for <i>Bnei Yisrael</i>,
as He places His <i>beracha</i> upon the loaves of bread so that sustenance
will flow to the entire nation. Accordingly, the <i>shulchan</i> may be seen as
representative of the third pillar of the world, <i>gemillus chasadim</i>.</p>

<P><i>Asara B'Teves</i> is a most appropriate time to be
mindful of the destruction of the <i>Bais HaMikdash</i> and to internalize the
importance of Torah, <i>avoda</i> and <i>gemilus chasodim</i> which the <i>klai
Hamikdash</i> represent.</p>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Benjamin Yudin]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2010]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: omer]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>We find ourselves in the period of the <i>Omer</i>. In <i>Parshas
Emor</i> (23:15) we are taught "You shall count for yourselves, from the
morrow of the rest day when you bring the <i>omer</i> of the waving, seven
weeks they shall be complete". A few basic questions are in order.</p>

<P>We know that an <i>omer </i>is a dry measure. We first
encounter the term in conjunction with the <i>mann</i>, <i>Shemos</i> (16:16): "This is the thing that Hashem has commanded, gather from it for every man
according to what he eats, an <i>omer</i> per person." Why then is the <i>korban</i>
brought on the second day of <i>Pesach </i>known as the <i>Korban Omer</i>?
Yes, an <i>omer</i>'s worth of barley was brought as a <i>korban</i>, but
it seems strange that it should be called "the dry measure <i>korban</i>".
Moreover, in the <i>bracha</i> instituted prior to the counting why not say,
"<i>V'Tzivanu al sfiras shavuos</i> - and He commanded us to count
weeks", for indeed we are counting the weeks to the holiday of <i>Shavuos</i>;
why do we instead say "<i>al sfiras haomer</i> - to count the <i>omer</i>"?</p>

<P>Rav Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg <i>zt"l</i> in his <i>Haksav
V'Hakabalah</i> offers a novel fresh interpretation. He says that we
should not focus on the <i>omer</i> as a dry measure but rather as it is used
in <i>Devorim</i> (24:7) "If a man is found kidnapping a person of his
brethren, among the Children of Israel &#8216;<i>V'Hishamer Bo</i> - and
he enslaves him or subjugates him' and sells him, that kidnapper shall
die and you shall remove the evil from your midst". </p>

<P>The word <i>omer</i> means to subjugate and that is the
application and understanding in relation to this time, <i>korban</i>,<i> </i>and
<i>mitzvah</i> of counting. The Torah refers to the <i>Korban Omer</i> in <i>Vayikra</i>
(2:14) as a "<i>Minchas Bikurim</i> - a meal offering of the first grain
to Hashem". When one is blessed with prosperity, represented by the first
grain, &nbsp;there is always the possibility of erroneously attributing the
success of their labor to themselves, as the <i>Torah</i> cautions in <i>Devorim</i>
(8:17) "and you may say in your heart, my strength and the might of my
hand brought me all this wealth". Therefore, the <i>Torah</i> mandates
that the <i>kohein</i> take the <i>omer </i>of barley and wave it in all
directions to indicate that this produce and bounty came from Hashem.</p>

<P>In addition, the designation of this time as "<i>omer</i>",
as for example the title of chapter 493 of <i>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim</i> is
"the laws applicable in the days of the <i>omer</i>", may be
interpreted in light of the above as days of subjugation, or our willingness to
yield to a Higher Authority. Thus, for each individual, starting with the
second day of <i>Pesach</i>, a psychological and intellectual commitment is
being reinforced by their personal counting of the <i>omer</i>. In a sense one
is declaring, "count me in". This also sheds light on the <i>minhag
Yisrael</i> to study <i>Pirkei Avos</i> during this time of <i>omer</i>,
providing concrete formulae of true <i>omer</i> - subjugation to Hashem.</p>

<P>The <i>Gemorah Shabbos</i> (31A) explains the verse from
Isaiah (33:6) "<i>V'Haya emunas eatecha</i>&#8230;" as referring
to the six sections of the <i>mishnah</i>. "<i>Emunas</i>" refers
to the section of the <i>Zeraim</i>, which deals almost exclusively with the
agricultural laws of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. It is called "<i>e</i><i>munas</i>-
faith", explains the <i>Yerushalmi</i>, because the farmer who sows his
seeds places his faith is Hashem. The subsequent teaching by Rava is that when
each individual is brought before the heavenly tribunal for judgment, they will
be asked (a) did you conduct your business honestly, or, more precisely, with
faith? (b) did you set aside fixed times for Torah study?, for if one believes
that his business success or livelihood is from Hashem, then it follows that he
was afforded this blessing to enable him to set fixed times for Torah study.
(This is the one form of the subjugation of the <i>omer</i> period). </p>

<P>In <i>Parshas Emor</i>, each holiday is presented and its
specific laws taught in a paragraph dedicated exclusively to that holiday. The
paragraph of <i>Shavuos</i>, however, concludes (23:22)&nbsp; with a
description of seemingly irrelevant agricultural gifts to the poor such as
leaving the corner of the field (<i>pe'ah)</i> for the poor to harvest themselves
and leaving &nbsp;the fallen gleanings of the harvest (<i>leket</i>) for the
poor. The paragraph of <i>Shavuos</i> concludes this way because these laws
embody the message of the <i>omer.</i> If the produce is mine, the result of my
knowledge, expertise, and farming acumen, then why should I necessarily share
my produce with the less fortunate? However, if I recognize and acknowledge
that it all comes from On High, I subjugate myself to His Higher Authority, and
His requiring the dispensing of my assets to the poor and needy is very much in
place. A greater commitment to needs of others and of the community is an implementation
of the true character and essence of the <i>omer</i>.</p>

<P>
Purim is a very busy day. The very fulfillment of the four <i>mitzvos</i>
of the day (reading the <i>Megillah</i>, seeking out and giving gifts to at
least two poor individuals, the Purim meal celebration, and sending <i>mishloach
manos</i>- food parcels to at least one person) is most time consuming.
Moreover, the tone and flavor of the day is one that distracts us from serious
contemplation and meditation. Thus, I welcome the opportunity to share some
serious uplifting food for thought to help us appreciate the special holiday of
Purim. </p>

<P>
The Rambam in his introduction to his enumeration of the 613
<i>mitzvos</i> of the Torah (in his introduction to <i>Yad HaChazakah</i>)
notes that even the Ravnic <i>mitzvos</i> have a biblical frame of reference.
The Ravs could not, would not institute a holiday that did not reflect a
biblical tenet. Case in point: Purim demonstrates that special relationship
that exists between Hashem and the Jewish nation. As is stated (<i>Devarim</i>
4:7) "for which is a great nation that has a G-d Who is close to it, as
is Hashem, our G-d, whenever we call to Him." G-d promises: Call to Me,
pray to Me and I will respond positively. Esther (4:16),
"go assemble all the Jews that are to be found in Shushan, and fast for
me." We fasted, we prayed and it was effective. This, according to the Rambam
is a primary characteristic of the holiday of Purim, namely the efficacy of
prayer. </p>

<P>
The Chofetz Chaim zt"l in his <i>Shaim Olam</i> (<i>Shaar
Hischazkus</i> ch. 14) utilizes Purim to buttress the faith - <i>emunah</i> we
are to have in our ultimate redemption. The prophet Isaiah (51:1, 2) teaches
"look to the rock from which you were hewn, and the hollow of the pit
from which you were dug, who bore you." The prophet, says the saintly Chofetz
Chaim, is comforting the Jewish nation that would experience and endure long
painful humiliating and degrading exiles. "Don't despair."
Look at Avraham and Sarah. They were blessed with a child when they were
respectfully 100 and 90 years, when they had despaired from children. Proof:
Abraham&#8216;s response after his circumcision that he will have a child with
Sarah was, (<i>Braishis</i> 17:18) "O that Yishmael might live before
you." It is only then that they bore Yitzchak. On the verse (<i>Braishis</i>
15:5) "and He took him outside" Rashi cites our <i>Chazal </i>(Talmud
<i>Shabbos</i> 156) that Hashem took Avraham and his descendants outside the
realm of nature and the natural order of the world. </p>

<P>
Who could have imagined that after hundreds of years of
back-breaking servitude, Pharoah himself would liberate the enslaved Jewish
people and ask for a blessing from them (<i>Shemos</i> 12:32). If
the above is not sufficiently startling, who could have imagined that the former
slaves would 7 weeks later experience prophecy the likes of which Ezekiel the
prophet did not savor, as the Torah states (<i>Devarim</i> 5:4) "face to
face did Hashem speak to you on the mountain".</p>

<P>
Finally, the upcoming holiday of Purim serves as a bastion
of faith. In Esther (3:12, 13) we read of the dreadful
decree against the Jewish nation "to destroy, to slay and to exterminate
all the Jews, in one day on the 13th of the 12th month, and to plunder their
possessions". Who could have envisioned that on that very day it would
all be reversed, and the Jews would kill their enemies, "and many from
among the people of the land professed themselves Jews, for the fear of the
Jews had fallen upon <u>them</u>" (Esther 8:17). </p>

<P>
Imagine the excitement that accompanied the writing of <i>Megillas</i>
Esther by Mordechai and Esther. At the completion of the scroll, after
enumerating the <i>mitzvos</i> of the day, they write with prophetic certainty
(Esther 9:28)
"and these days should be remembered and celebrated by every generation,
every family&#8230; and these days of Purim should never cease among the Jews
nor shall their remembrance perish from their descendants." Pinch
yourself! Your celebrating with your family, your community is living proof of
this prophecy. But moreover, the celebration teaches us the veracity of the
future prophecy of redemption for our people. Purim is a day that bolsters our
faith, despite the most challenging conditions that surround us.</p>

<P>
There are 3 possible reasons, suggests the Chofetz Chaim, as
to why an individual will not respond positively to the request for assistance
from another. The first is that just prior to being approached the usually
generous mild mannered individual was aggrieved and aggRavated, and hence will
act out of character and say no. Secondly, he truly wants to assist but does
have the wherewithal to say yes. Finally, he wants to help, has the ability to
help but is fearful that the petitioner will squander the financial assistance
and lacks the resolve to use it wisely. </p>

<P>
None of the above applies to Hashem. King David (<i>Tehillim</i>
130:7,8) states "for with Hashem is kindness and abundant redemption and
He shall redeem Israel from all its
iniquities". The first possibility of catching Him "out of
character" doesn't apply as He is constantly abounded by kindness.
The second reason, namely the inability to help cannot be ascribed to Hashem,
as the verse attests He possesses abundant redemption. The third and final
possibility, the paucity of merit of the recipient, or perhaps the
transgressions of the Jewish people make then ineligible for redemption, this
too does not apply as the verse concludes with His redeeming Israel
unequivocally. </p>

<P>
Purim is an injection of optimism and a booster shot of <i>emunah</i>
and <i>bitachon</i>. May this appreciation of the day add to your <i>simchas Purim</i>.

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Yonason Sacks]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2010]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: yisro]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[
<P>
While all <i>rishonim</i> maintain that the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>Kiddush</i>
is derived from the <i>posuk</i> of "<i>Zachor es yom hashabbos l'kadsho
</i>- Remember the <i>Shabbos</i> day to sanctify it" (<i>Shemos</i>
20:8), the fundamental nature of this "<i>Zechira</i>" is subject
to considerable debate. The Rambam (<i>Hil. Shabbos</i> 29:1) employs this <i>posuk</i>
to teach that one must commemorate the <i>Shabbos</i> at both its commencement
and at its departure with "<i>zechiras shevach v'kiddush</i>"
- words of "praise and sanctification." The Rambam's presentation
appears to characterize <i>Kiddush</i> and <i>Havdallah</i> as serving to
offset <i>Shabbos</i> from the rest of the week, bookending the <i>Shabbos</i>
with expressions of the day's uniqueness (see also <i>Sefer HaMitzvos</i>
155). Based on the Rambam's insistence upon expressions of "praise
and sanctification," the <i>Minchas Chinuch</i> (31) infers that actual
verbal articulation of <i>Kiddush</i> is necessary for fulfillment of the
mitzvah: mere mental contemplation is insufficient (see, however, <i>Pri Megadim</i>
E.A. 271:2). </p>


<P>
The Ramban (<i>Shemos</i> 20:8), however, characterizes <i>Kiddush</i> in
a somewhat different fashion. In describing the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>Kiddush</i>,
the Ramban analogizes the <i>Kiddush</i> of Friday night to the inaugural <i>Kiddush</i>
of the <i>Yovel</i> year performed by the <i>Beis Din</i>. Rather than merely
demarcating <i>Shabbos</i> from the rest of the week, <i>Kiddush</i> serves to
literally consecrate and infuse the day of <i>Shabbos</i> with holiness. Although
the <i>kedushas hayom</i> of <i>Shabbos</i> is not actually contingent upon
human sanctification - whether a person recites <i>Kiddush</i> or not, <i>Shabbos</i>
invariably begins at Sunset on Friday night (see, for example, <i>Beitzah</i>
17a) - the Torah nonetheless enjoins us to actively participate in the
inauguration of the <i>Shabbos</i>. </p>



<P>
The Ramban's understanding of <i>Kiddush</i> finds precedent in
other areas of <i>halacha</i> as well. A similar model may be found, for
example, in the <i>halachos</i> pertaining to the <i>Kedushas Bechor</i> of an
animal (see <i>Nedarim</i> 13a). Although firstborn animals are intrinsically
endowed with sanctity from birth, irrespective of whether the owner actually
declares the firstborn as "sanctified" or not, the owner of the
animal is nonetheless commanded to actively declare the firstborn as
sanctified. The Mordechai (<i>Gittin</i> 4:380) expresses a similar concept
regarding the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>shemitas kesafim</i> (relinquishing of
loans) of the <i>shemittah</i> year. Despite the fact that the <i>shemittah</i>
year will cancel loans regardless of a lender's intent (see, however, <i>Yeraim</i>
278), the Torah commands all lenders to formally declare that they relinquish
their loans. The Ramban perceives <i>Kiddush</i> in a similar fashion, as it
represents the human involvement in the sanctification of the day at its onset.
</p>


<P>
The practical difference between the interpretations of the Rambam and
the Ramban expresses itself in the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>Havdallah</i>. Because
the Rambam understands "<i>Zachor es yom hashabbos l'kadsho</i>"
as an imperative to offset <i>Shabbos</i> from the rest of the week, the Rambam
derives <i>both</i> the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>Kiddush</i> as well as the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>Havdallah</i> from the same <i>posuk</i>. Both <i>mitzvos</i> serve an identical
role, bookending the <i>Shabbos</i> from the remaining days of the week. In the
Ramban's view, however, "<i>Zachor es yom hashabbos l'kadsho</i>"
enjoins us to sanctify the <i>Shabbos</i> at its onset in a manner comparable
to the sanctification of the <i>Yovel</i>. Hence, the <i>posuk</i> only refers
to <i>Kiddush</i> at the inauguration of <i>Shabbos</i>, but not to <i>Havdallah</i>.</p>



<P>
The Ramban notes that his understanding of <i>Kiddush</i> as a "<i>Mekadesh</i>"
or "sanctifier" of the day accounts nicely for the <i>d'rabanan</i>
(Ravnic) status of the <i>Shabbos</i> morning <i>Kiddush</i>, "<i>Kiddusha
Rabba</i>." Just as the sanctification of the <i>Yovel</i> and of <i>Rosh
Chodesh</i> is performed solely at the onset of the event, so too the <i>Kiddush</i>
of <i>Shabbos</i> can only be performed (on a Biblical level) at the beginning
of <i>Shabbos</i>. Any subsequent "<i>Kiddush</i>" during the
course of Shabbos can only exist as a Ravnic replica.</p>


<P>
In addition to the <i>d'oraisa</i> (Biblical) <i>Kiddush</i>
recited at the onset of <i>Shabbos</i>, <i>Chazal</i> instituted a secondary <i>Kiddush</i>
to be recited on Shabbos morning, known as "<i>Kiddusha Rabba</i>."
The Rambam (<i>Hil. Shabbos</i> 29:10) maintains that, like the <i>d'oraisa
Kiddush</i> of Friday night, one may not eat prior to reciting <i>Kiddusha Rabba</i>.
The Ra'avad (ibid.) disagrees, arguing that the &#8216;true' <i>Kiddush</i>,
which entails a prohibition of eating, was recited on Friday night. <i>Kiddusha
Rabba</i> of the daytime, however, demands no such stringency. The Maharam Chalava
(<i>Pesachim</i> 106a) echoes the Ra'avad's sentiment, explicitly
stating that, despite its name, "<i>Ein zeh Kiddush mammash</i>" - Kiddusha
Rabba is "not a &#8216;literal' <i>Kiddush</i>." The Maharam Chalava
supports this notion by citing <i>Kiddush HaChodesh</i> of <i>Beis D</i>in:
just as <i>Kiddush HaChodesh</i> of <i>Beis Din</i> entails a single act of
inauguration at the commencement of the month, so too the Biblical mitzvah of <i>Kiddush</i>
on <i>Shabbos</i> requires only a single declaration.</p>


<P>
Apparently, the Ra'avad and Maharam Chalava understand the
essential nature of <i>Kiddusha Rabba</i> differently than the Rambam. The Rambam
appears to view <i>Kiddusha Rabba</i> as a form of "<i>Kiddush</i>"
- albeit Ravnic. In other words, when the <i>Rabbanan</i> instituted <i>Kiddusha
Rabba</i>, they modeled it after the Biblical form of <i>Kiddush</i>. Hence, <i>Kiddusha
Rabba</i> carries the identical stringencies of <i>Kiddush d'oraisa</i>,
including the prohibition of eating and the necessary recital "<i>b'makom
seuda</i>." The Ra'avad and Maharam Chalava, however, assume that <i>Kiddusha
Rabba</i> is not included under the rubric of "<i>Kiddush</i>" in
any shape or form. Rather, <i>Kiddusha Rabba</i> constitutes an independent Ravnic
mitzvah to enhance the <i>Shabbos</i> day meal with wine, which is not
patterned after the <i>d'oraisa mitzvah</i> of "<i>Kiddush</i>."
Hence, <i>Kiddusha Rabba</i> does not assume the same stringencies as the
nighttime <i>Kiddush</i>. </p>


<P>
This dispute may also express itself in the obligation of women to recite
<i>Kiddusha Rabba</i>. According to the Rambam, <i>Kiddusha Rabba</i> is
patterned after the <i>Mitvah d'oraisa</i> of <i>Kiddush</i>. Hence, just
as women are uniquely obligated in the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>Kiddush</i> based
on a special derivation of the <i>Gemarah</i> (see <i>Berachos</i> 20b), so too
women are obligated to perform <i>Kiddusha Rabba</i>, which exists as an
extension of <i>Kiddush</i>. According to the Raavad and <i>Maharam Chalava</i>,
however, <i>Kiddusha Rabba</i> is not connected to <i>Kiddush</i>, despite its
name. Rather, <i>Kiddusha Rabba</i> constitutes a new <i>mitzvah</i> to enhance
the Shabbos meal with wine. As such, it constitutes a <i>mitzvas assei shehazaman
grama</i> (positive time-bound <i>mitzvah</i>), and women are thus exempt.</p>


<P>
Perhaps the Rambam's understanding of <i>Kiddusha Rabba</i> as a Ravnic
form of <i>Kiddush</i> (as opposed to an independent Ravnic <i>mitzvah</i>
bearing no relationship to <i>Kiddush</i>) may be rooted in his aforementioned
general understanding of the nature of <i>Kiddush</i>. Recall that the Maharam Chalava
questioned the possibility of reciting <i>Kiddush</i> during the day -
even if the <i>Kiddush</i> is only <i>mid'rabanan</i> - based on
the fact that <i>Kiddush HaChodesh</i> of <i>Beis Din</i> is performed only at
the beginning of the month. The Rambam, however, would reject this analogy,
maintaining that <i>Kiddush</i> of <i>Shabbos</i> is incomparable to <i>Kiddush
HaChodesh</i> of <i>Beis Din</i>. While <i>Kiddush HaChodesh</i> of <i>Beis Din</i>
marks the consecration of the month, <i>Kiddush</i> on Shabbos functions solely
to offset Shabbos from the rest of the week. Hence, although <i>Kiddush</i> of <i>Beis
Din</i> may only be performed at the onset of the month, one <i>could</i>
envision the possibility of <i>Kiddush</i> (albeit <i>Mid'rabanan</i>) in
the middle of <i>Shabbos</i>. </p>

<P>
The <i>Gemarah</i> in <i>Maseches Berachos</i> (27b) relates: "<i>mispallel
odom shel shabbos b'erev Shabbos v'omer k'dusha al hakos</i>"
- one may recite the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> of <i>Shabbos</i> and <i>Kiddush</i>
on <i>Erev Shabbos</i>. At first glance, the dispensation to recite the <i>Shabbos
Kiddush</i> on a weekday appears difficult. Many <i>rishonim</i> explain this
ruling through the principle of "<i>tosefes Shabbos</i>" - the
ability to actually "begin <i>Shabbos</i> early:" While <i>Kiddush</i>
most certainly must be recited on <i>Shabbos</i> itself, when one accepts the
sanctity of <i>Shabbos</i> early, one may also recite <i>Kiddush</i> early. Based
on this understanding, many authorities (see <i>Or Zaruah Hilchos Erev Shabbos</i>
14 and <i>Ra'ah</i> ibid.) rule that the institution of "<i>tosefes
Shabbos</i>" must be <i>mid'oraisa</i>: if the ability to accept
Shabbos early was merely a Ravnic innovation which was unrecognized on a Biblical
level, one could not possibly fulfill one's Biblical <i>Kiddush</i>
obligation during that time (see however, <i>Mordechai </i>(<i>Megillah</i>
2:798)).</p>


<P>
Interestingly, however, the Rambam makes no mention of <i>tosefes Shabbos</i>
anywhere in his <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (<i>Hil. Shevisas
Esor</i> 1:6), as explained by the <i>Beiur Halacha</i> (261 <i>s.v.</i>
"<i>Yeish Omrim</i>"), explains that the Rambam considers <i>tosefes
Shabbos</i> to be a purely Ravnic institution. The <i>Kesef Mishneh</i> (<i>Hil.
Shabbos</i> 4:3) goes further, arguing that the Rambam rejects the notion of <i>tosefes
Shabbos</i> entirely - even <i>mid'rabanan</i>. Either way, if the Rambam
does not recognize the possibility for biblically accepting <i>Shabbos</i>
early on Friday afternoon, he faces an obvious difficulty: how can the <i>Gemarah</i>
sanction reciting <i>Kiddush</i> on Friday afternoon?</p>


<P>
The Rambam addresses this issue himself. In quoting the aforementioned <i>Gemarah</i>,
the Rambam writes (<i>Hil. Shabbos</i> 29:11): one may recite <i>Kiddush</i> on
Friday afternoon<i>, even though the Shabbos has not yet begun</i>&#8230;because
the <i>mitzvah</i> of &#8216;<i>Zechira'</i> obliges one to recite <i>Kiddush</i>
and <i>Havdallah</i> at the commencement and departure of Shabbos, or slightly
beforehand or afterwards" (<i>Hil. Shabbos</i> 29:11). The Rambam
explicitly acknowledges that <i>Kiddush</i> need not be recited on Shabbos
itself. If one recited <i>Kiddush</i> on Friday afternoon before the actual
onset of Shabbos, one nonetheless fulfills the <i>d'oraisa Kiddush</i>
obligation. The Rambam's license to recite <i>Kiddush</i> before the
actual commencement of Shabbos fits consistently with the Rambam's
general understanding of the nature of <i>Kiddush</i>. Because <i>Kiddush</i>
serves to mark off <i>Shabbos</i> from the rest of the week, it must be recited
sometime around the transitional point from Friday to <i>Shabbos</i>, but not
necessarily on <i>Shabbos</i> itself. If, however, one assumes like the Ramban,
that <i>Kiddush</i> of <i>Shabbos</i> is analogous to <i>Kiddush</i> of <i>Yovel</i>
and <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>, one must certainly wait until <i>Shabbos</i> itself to
sanctify the <i>Shabbos</i>, as is the case with <i>Yovel</i> and <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>,
one must certainly wait until <i>Shabbos</i> itself to <i>sanctify</i> the <i>Shabbos</i>,
as is the case with <i>Yovel</i> and <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P align="center">I</p>

<P>The opening verse of <i>parshas Nitzavim</i> is understood
on many levels. Rashi understands it as a source of consolation. The Torah in <i>parshas
Ki Tavo</i> enumerated ninety-eight curses, and the very listening to them
conveys fear of extinction and annihilation; therefore, the Torah says, despite
the punishments and catastrophes "<i>atem nitzavim hayom</i>"- you
are standing erect today. The Jewish nation endures and will endure forever. </p>

<P>The<i> </i>Zohar understands the word "<i>hayom</i>"-
today, to refer to the day of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>. The Talmud <i>Megillah</i>
(31B) teaches that Ezra instituted that <i>Parshas Nitzavim</i> be read as a
buffer between the curses of <i>Ki Tavo </i>and the holiday of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>.
The Alter of Kelm, citing the Tur at the beginning of the laws of <i>Rosh
Hashanah</i> in the name of Rabi Chanina and Rabi Yehoshua, sees a
great lesson in the word "<i>kulchem"</i>- the entire nation, as a
modifier of "<i>nitzavim</i>". Ordinarily an individual on trial
for his life will not be concerned regarding his personal appearance before the
court. He will not necessarily shave or get a haircut, nor dress in any other
garments but black. In sharp contrast, <i>Am Yisroel</i> gets haircuts, dons
white clothing, and eat and drink <i>Yom Tov</i> meals as they know Hashem will
perform a miracle on their behalf. </p>

<P>Where does this state of optimism come from? The Alter of Kelm
explains that each individual indeed should worry and enter <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>
in a state of personal fear and trepidation. Regarding his personal fate this
forthcoming year in the areas of health, family tranquility and prosperity, he
has no assurance and guarantee that what was will necessarily continue to be.
But one thing he can be absolutely assured of and guaranteed: the Jewish nation
as a people will survive, and play a significant role in the unfolding of world
history. </p>

<P>The way for the individual, therefore, to overcome or at
least assuage their personal fears is to connect themselves to the <i>Klal</i>-
to the community- to the Jewish nation. <i>Kulchem</i> is the answer! The more
an individual is needed by the community - he does not only study Torah, but is
part of a Torah study group; the more he encourages others to participate, the
more essential he is to the group - the merits of the <i>Klal</i> will
encompass and embrace him. This is true in regard to his <i>gemilus chasadim</i>-
his involvement in various <i>gemachs</i>, societies that assist neighbors in
all different ways, raises his stature from that of individual to member of <i>Klal.</i>
Even one's <i>tefillah,</i> if they are an integral part of the <i>minyan</i>-
contribute not only financially but experientially, by his <i>kavanah</i>-
concentration and seriousness of purpose - his personal station and position becomes
upgraded, and hence he is "<i>nitzavim</i>" on <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>
thanks to the coat-tail effect of the guaranteed survival of the Jewish nation.
</p>

<P align="center">II</p>

<P>We begin this Saturday night in the Ashkenazi community the
recitation of <i>Selichos</i>. This too fits very comfortably with <i>Parshas Nitzavim</i>.
Our <i>parsha</i> speaks of the phenomenon of <i>Teshuva</i> in <i>perek</i> 30,
and <i>Selichos</i> is based on the foundation of <i>Teshuva</i>. To the Rambam,
our Torah reading is a Divine prediction that the Jewish nation will repent<i>.</i></p>

<P>The essence of <i>Selichos</i> is not to plead before Hashem
for mercy, by claiming that after all "I'm sorry, we are frail and
mortal, let bygones be bygones". We believe that He only asks of us what
we can definitely do and fulfill. The essence of <i>Selichos</i> is found in
Rosh Hashanah (17B), where R' Yochanan taught that following the sin of
the Golden Calf, Hashem Himself enveloped Himself in a <i>tallis</i>, as a <i>shaliach</i>
<i>tzibur </i>(<i>chazzan</i>), and recited the 13 <i>Middos</i> - Attributes
of Hashem. He taught that when the Jewish People will be in need of
forgiveness, they should "<i>ya'asu </i>- perform" before Me
this order of attributes. The commentaries highlight the fact that it does not
say "recite" before Me these attributes, but "perform",
implying a substantive act; man is to resolve to change. This is the essence of
<i>Selichos,</i> articulating the resolve but also pledging oneself to perform
the 611<sup>th</sup> <i>mitzvah</i> of "<i>v'halachta b'drachav</i>"-
to emulate His attributes. As He is kind, compassionate and slow to anger, so
will I endeavor to be. </p>

<P>The Medrash in <i>Parshas Noach</i> sheds illustrates Hashem's
attribute of patience. On the verse that Hashem smelled the sweet aroma,
"<i>rai'ach ni'cho'ach</i>", of Noah's
offering, the <i>medrash</i> teaches He smelled Avraham being thrown into the
furnace, and Chananel, Mishael and Azaryah being cast by Nebuchadnezar into the
great furnace. The commentary Maasei Hashem explains this challenging <i>medrash.</i>
Given that Hashem is incorporeal, what does it mean that He "smelled"
and savored the <i>Korban</i>? He explains that the sense of smell is different
from the other senses. Without seeing or touching the object one can often
identify the source of the fragrance from a distance. One can stand outside the
home <i>Erev Shabbos</i> or <i>Erev Yom Tov</i> and smell and anticipate the
delicacies. Similarly, Hashem saw in the future the sacrifice and <i>Kiddush Hashem</i>
of Avraham and the other <i>tzaddikim</i> and thereby decided not to destroy
the world again.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: pinchas]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>
There is a difference of opinion among the commentaries when
the five daughters of Tzlofchad approach Moshe with their question as to
whether daughters inherit their fathers in the absence of sons. Their clarion
cry is "give us an inheritance among our father's brothers" (<i>Bamidbar</i>
27:4). The <i>Yalkut Shimoni </i>(chapter 773) learns that the incident took
place in the 2nd year of their being in the desert, immediately after the sin
of the spies. The commentary <i>Zayis Raanan</i> on the above <i>Yalkut</i>
presents the second opinion that goes with the order that it is presented in
the Torah, namely, the daughters of Tzlofchad came after the death of Aharon,
in the fortieth year (see Rashi 26:13). Following Aharon's demise, they
started tRaveling in the opposite direction, away from Israel back
towards Egypt. Regardless of the timing, what is most exemplary on the part of these five
righteous women is that at a time when the popular tide and trend of the nation
was "let us appoint a leader and let us return to Egypt"
(<i>Bamidbar</i> 14:4) they requested an inheritance in the Land of Israel</p>

<P>
The <i>Yalkut</i> derives a most important principle from
the above: one who lives in a society that is practicing evil, but has the
integrity and commitment to buck the system and do what is right, not only
receives his due reward, but also all the potential reward and blessings that could
have been accrued by the generation. Thus, just as Noach at the time of the flood,
Avraham at the generation of the <i>haflaga</i> (Tower of Babel and time of
national dispersion) and even Lot in S'dom, received the potential reward
of their generations, so to the daughters of Tzlofchad not only received their
reward for their love of the Land and pining, but received the reward that was
potentially awaiting the rest of the generation.</p>

<P>
The above <i>Yalkut</i> teaches that not every <i>mitzvah</i>
is created equally. Often the timing and environment of the <i>mitzvah</i>, and
whether it is popularly observed with relative ease or requires major sacrifice
to rise to the occasion, will determine the significance of the <i>mitzvah</i>.
We are all familiar with the sociological history of America
seventy to eighty years ago when many immigrants came to its shores and had to
make a most difficult sacrifice on behalf of <i>Shabbos</i>. If one
didn't come to work on a Saturday they were not welcomed at work on
Monday. Today, most persons have little difficulty timing a job that allows
them to observe <i>Shabbos</i>. Moreover, the law prohibits today religious
discrimination. <i>Kashrus</i> at one time was a major challenge. It's
hard to believe that there really was a time when kosher pizza, Chinese,
Mexican, sushi, and every other cuisine, was not available. Timing and
sacrifice play a significant role. </p>

<P>
A further proof that not all <i>mitzvos</i> are created
equal: the Gra notes in his commentary to the Talmud <i>Yuma</i> 22B (<i>Sefer
Meor Hagadol</i> on <i>Aggados</i> of <i>Shas</i>) that Shaul erred in one sin,
and it was reckoned against him - he lost the throne, whereas David erred in
two sins and it was not reckoned against him. The Gra explains that here as
well, it was not Divine favoritism towards one over the other, rather, the <i>mitzvah</i>
of Shaul to blot out Amalek was a communal one that he violated, a <i>mitzvah</i>
that only he as king of Israel could do. His violation thereof was therefore
punished in a most severe way. The two sins of David were of a personal nature,
and they were thus forgivable after and including personal punishments. Once
again, timing played a most significant role in the assessment of <i>mitzvos</i>
and <i>aveiros</i>.</p>

<P>
The <i>mishna</i> in <i>Avos</i> (5:3) teaches that Avraham
received "<i>sechar kulam</i>"- the reward that was potentially due
to the ten generations, between Noach and Avraham. <i>Rabbeinu</i> Yona
explains that this does not mean that he took their <i>sechar</i> in a literal
sense, but rather he that filled the gap that they left in their neglect, and
his living a life of <i>mitzvos</i> accomplished and had the value of all of
theirs' combined.</p>

<P>
One of the most challenging <i>mitzvos</i> we face,
especially in our generation, during the summer is that of "<i>v'haya
machanecha kadosh</i>"- your environment should be holy, worthy of the <i>Shechinah</i>.
The Chofetz Chaim notes that only a breach of <i>tznius</i> evokes Hashem's
threat to withdraw from our midst. Therefore, in a season when the actions of
those around us threaten to distance the <i>Shechinah</i> from us, we are
presented with a unique opportunity to up to the temptations of our environmental
pressures that run counter to modesty. We are able in this season to
single-handedly bring the <i>Shechinah</i> into our midst to the same degree that
would be the result of everyone dressing modestly. </p>

<P>
While the <i>mishnah</i> in <i>Sanhedrin</i> teaches that
each person is a world unto themselves, this <i>Yalkut</i> teaches how one
person can literally uphold the world by themselves.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: toldos]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>There are no "Bible stories" in the Bible. Every
narrative is there to teach an eternal lesson. Thus, at the beginning of <i>parshas
Toldos</i> when Rivka experienced unusual pain and agitation in her pregnancy
we are told that in addition to her visit to the gynecologist, she goes to seek
the word of Hashem. The prophet (Shem <i>ben</i> Noach) informs her that indeed
she was carrying two fetuses who were the progenitors of two nations that would
hate and fight with one another, and that they were already engaged in the quarrel
at the very beginning of their formation in the womb. This was a portent of
what would ultimately transpire between them after their establishment as
nations.</p>

<P>
It is fascinating to note the usage of the <i>kri </i>and <i>ksiv
</i>that is found within this prophecy. The Hebrew word for nations is <i>goyim</i>,
yet the word is spelled in the Torah without the letter <i>vav</i>, but with
two <i>yud</i>s, thereby yielding the word <i>gayim</i> which means not nations
but great princely individuals. In other words, aside from foretelling two
great conflicting cultures of Israel and Rome, which
is the literal understanding of the verse, the Torah is alluding to two great descendants,
one from Yaakov and one from Eisav.</p>

<P>
Had I been asked to suggest a royal descendant of Yaakov
that perhaps the Torah might be referring to, I would have nominated King David
or King Solomon. The Talmud (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 10B) however tells us that the
verse or the <i>passuk</i> is referring specifically to Rebbi - Rav Yehuda <i>HaNassi</i>,
and Antonius a Roman Caesar descended from Eisav. Rashi in his commentary cites
this Talmudic teaching. Why might the Torah in the midst of this prophecy
allude to the special unique relationship of warmth and friendship that existed
between these two leaders?</p>

<P>
Rav Simcha Ziskind Brody <i>zt"l</i>, Rosh Yeshiva
in Yeshiva Chevron in <i>Yerushalayim</i>, in his work entitled <i>Som Derech</i>
suggests a remarkable solution to the above question. On the <i>passuk</i> in <i>Koheles</i>
(1:5) "and the sun rises and the sun sets" the <i>Medrash Koheles</i>
explains this to mean that before the sun of one <i>tzaddik</i> sets, the sun
of another <i>tzaddik</i> rises to replace them. Thus, the Torah informs us in <i>Bereishis</i>
(22:23) of
the birth of Rivka, prior to the passing of Sarah in (23:1). Similarly, the <i>Medrash</i>
teaches that on the day that <i>Rebbe</i> Akiva died Rebbi was born. <i>Rebbe</i>
Akiva was tortured to death by the Romans (as taught at the end of Brachos 61B).
Rebbi was thus born into a most difficult and dangerous time. <i>Tosfos</i> (<i>Avoda
Zarah</i> 10B) informs us the Romans forbade the Jews to perform circumcision. Rebbi's
parents circumcised their son, and the governor ordered them to appear before
the Caesar which meant certain death for the parents and baby. Antonius's
mother took a liking to and had pity on Rebbi's mother and saved Rebbi's
life by giving her uncircumcised baby to be brought by Rebbi's mother to
the Caesar. Rebbi's mother nursed Antonius, and perhaps this was the
factor that led to the warm friendly relationship between these two great
leaders of Rome and Israel.</p>

<P>The incredible significance of this relationship enabled Rebbi
to have the peace of mind to redact and edit the <i>Shisha Sidrei Mishnah</i>,
the foundation and core of the Oral law, <i>Torah shel ba'al peh</i>. Rav
Brody <i>z"l</i> in his commentary on the Ramban, notes that after the
prophet informs Rivka of the prophecy he tells her that now they (the fetuses) would
rest from their agitation, and she would find peace and tranquility for her
soul. Why does the Ramban need to inform us that the rest of her pregnancy was
quiet and uneventful? Perhaps the answer is that to create this truce between
the adversaries which is diametrically against their nature, it was necessary
to have a long period of quietude.</p>

<P>
What an incredible lesson the Torah is alluding to by use of
the <i>kri</i> and <i>ksiv</i>. We are being comforted that even in our darkest
hours of persecution Hashem is intervening and guiding history assuring both
the physical and spiritual survival and flourishing of the Jewish nation.</p>

<P>
This is similar to the exciting understanding of the <i>Meshech
Chochmah</i> in his commentary in <i>Parshas Eikev</i> (8:10) in
his analysis of <i>Birkas HaMazon</i>. The first paragraph of thanking Hashem
for our sustenance is most understandable. Why, however, do we include the Land of Israel in the
second blessing, the Royal House of David and the Temple in the
third blessing and the dead of Beitar in the fourth? He answers that the
recitation of Grace After Meals is not only thanking Hashem for His nourishment,
but acknowledging His additional kindnesses and Providence throughout our
history. We thank Hashem for bringing us to the Land of Israel for
giving us Monarchy and residing in our midst while we were blessed with the Holy Temple. Lest
one believe that in the period of <i>galus</i>- diaspora, Hashem has removed
Himself from our midst we recount the miracle that the many thousands of
corpses of Beitar did not decompose over a two and a half year period that the
Jewish community could not bury them. The lesson is clear that Hashem watches
over us at all times, thereby assuring us of the ultimate fulfillment of the
prophecy to Rivka that in the end the older one will serve the younger one.</p>

<P>
In his commentary on the <i>Hagaddah</i>, the Abarbanel
explains that all four questions of the <i>Mah Nishtana</i> revolve around a
single idea: the apparent contradiction of symbols on <i>Seder</i> night. On
one hand, the consumption of <i>matzah</i> and <i>maror</i> evokes a sense of
destitution and subjugation. On the other hand, the dipping and leaning
indicate royalty and freedom. By noting all four symbols, the perplexed child
really asks: on <i>Seder</i> night, are we slaves or are we free?</p>

<P>
The Abarbanel explains that the <i>Seder</i> employs
contradictory symbols because Pesach represents an instantaneous transition in
which <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> experienced both slavery and freedom on a single night. By acknowledging
the dire subjugation, a person comes to truly appreciate the magnitude of the
salvation. Hence, the <i>matzah</i> and the <i>maror</i> evoke bitter memories
of suffering in order to augment the joy of redemption.</p>

<P>
The Beis HaLevi (<i>Parshas Beshalach</i>) highlights this
value of contrast in explaining an initially perplexing Midrash:</p>



<P>
"<i>amar Moshe b'az' chatasi sheamarti,
'ume'az basi ledaber el Pharoh heira la'am hazeh', b'az'
ani omer shira</i> - Moshe stated: [With the word] '<i>az'</i> I
sinned when I stated 'Since (<i>ume'az</i>) I came to speak to
Pharaoh, he has been evil to this nation;' and with [the word] <i>az</i>,
I sing praise (<i>az yashir Moshe</i>).</p>


<P>Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i>
employed the very same term, "<i>az</i>," to describe both the
unbearable slavery in <i>Mitzrayim</i> as well as the ineffable joy of the
Exodus. This linguistic repetition suggests that Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i> praised <i>HaKadosh
Baruch Hu</i> not only for the eventual salvation, but also for the servitude
which preceded the salvation: if not for the prior servitude, no salvation
could be possible. The Beis HaLevi adds that this notion also underlies the <i>posuk</i>:
"<i>odecha ki anisani vatehi li l'yeshua</i> - I thank You, for You afflicted
me, and were for
me a salvation" (Tehillim 118). In this <i>posuk</i>, Dovid <i>Hamelech</i>
thanks <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> not only for his salvation, but also for his
affliction. Only in the context of the prior affliction can one truly
appreciate the salvation.</p>


<P>
The Rambam appears to perceive an additional value in
recalling the suffering which precedes salvation: beyond stimulating greater
appreciation for the salvation itself, our acknowledgment of the prior danger
attunes us to the specific reality that <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> listens to
our <i>tefillos</i> and comes to our rescue. In the beginning of his <i>Yad HaChazakah</i>,
the Rambam explains that the reason for reading the <i>Megillah</i> - which
describes not only the salvation of <i>Klal Yisrael</i> but also the initial
danger of Haman's decree - is "<i>keday l'hodia ledoros ha'ba'im
she'emmes ma shehivticho baTorah, 'ki mi goy gadol asher lo Elokim krovim
elav k'Hashem Elokeinu b'chol koreinu elav</i> - to affirm the fact
that <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> listens and responds to our pleas".
Similarly, in the context of <i>Yetziyas Mitzrayim</i>, we not only mention the
salvation, but also the initial enslavement, in order to accentuate the fact
that <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> listens to our prayers and comes to our rescue.
Perhaps this is the intent of the <i>possuk</i>, when it describes "<i>va'yay'anchu
Bnai Yisroel...vayizaku vata'al shavasam el haElokim...vayishma Hashem es
na'akasam</i>" immediately after <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> cried out,
"Hashem heard their cries."</p>

<P>
The value of celebrating both the suffering and the
salvation of Pesach night is expressed in other symbols of the Seder as well.
The single symbol of <i>matzah</i> represents both "<i>Lechem Oni</i> - poor
man's bread," and "<i>Lechem She'Onin Alav D'varim
Harbei </i>- bread upon which the <i>Hallel</i> and expressions of thanksgiving"
(see <i>Rashi Pesachim</i> 36a) are recited. The <i>maror</i> of Seder night
also expresses a similar dichotomy. While it certainly evokes bitter memories
of slavery and subjugation, the <i>Gemarah</i> also explains that one should
eat lettuce - "<i>chasah</i>" - "<i>mishum she'chas Rachmana
ilavan</i>- because <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i>
treated us with mercy". Thus, the single symbol of <i>maror</i> also
represents both slavery and salvation.</p>

<P>
This duality expresses itself in the Rishonim's
understanding of the wording of "<i>Ha Lachma Anya</i>": the Rashbam
understands the phrase "<i>di achalu avahasana b'arah d'Mitzrayim</i>"as a reference to the <i>matzah</i>
eaten with the <i>Korban</i> Pesach as <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> emerged as a free
nation on the night of <i>Yetziyas Mitzrayim</i>. The <i>Rashbatz</i>, however,
identifies the phrase as an allusion to the <i>matzah</i> eaten <i>before </i>the redemption, over the course of
the bitter servitude in <i>Mitzrayim</i>. These oppositional interpretations of
"<i>Ha Lachma Anya</i>" appear to mirror the dual symbols embedded
within <i>matzah</i> itself - slavery and freedom in a single symbol (see also Ramban
<i>al HaTorah</i>, <i>Devarim</i> 16:2, who echoes this sentiment as well,
suggesting that <i>matzah</i> <i>tirmoz lishnei devarim</i>)</p>

<P>
The Rambam's version of "<i>Ha Lachma Anya</i>"
may also underscore this duality. In his text of the <i>Hagaddah</i>, the Rambam
prefaces "<i>Ha Lachma Anya</i>" with the phrase: "<i>b'vihilu
yatzanu miMitzrayim, halacham anya diachalu avahasana b'arah dMitzrayim</i>
- with rapidity, we left Egypt. This is the bread of
affliction&#8230;" The initial part of the phrase evokes our speedy departure
from <i>Mitzrayim</i> as a free nation. The second phrase recalls the horrors
of our slavery. The juxtaposition of these two elements suggests that from the
depths of slavery and exile can spring hope and salvation.</p>

<P>
A similar idea is expressed in Rashi's explanation
"<i>Barcuh shomer havtachaso l'Yisroel baruch Hu</i> - Blessed is
He Who keeps His promise to Israel."</p>

<P>
The <i>Hagaddah</i> does not specify to which promise it
refers. The Ritva opines that the <i>Ba'al Hagaddah</i> - refers to the <i>Bris
Bein HaBesarim</i> (the Covenant Between the Parts") in which <i>HaKadosh
Baruch Hu</i> promised that Avraham <i>Avinu's</i> descendants would be
redeemed. Rashi, however, maintains that the promise refers to the servitude
itself. According to Rashi's reading, it would appear that the very
experience of suffering itself warrants praise and <i>beracha</i>. In this
respect, Rashi's understanding of <i>Baruch Shomer Havtachaso</i> may be
aptly compared to the Beis HaLevi's understanding of <i>Az Yashir</i>."</p>

<P>
Similarly, this lesson is implied in the passage - "<i>yarad
l'Mitzrayim anus al pi hadibbur</i> - He [Yaakov <i>Avinu</i>] went down
to Egypt, compelled by Devine
decree."</p>

<p><i>Chazal</i> underscore that Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> did not leave <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>
willingly. The Ra'avan writes that in theory, Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> should
have been forced down to <i>Mitzrayim</i> in iron chains to fulfill the decree
of <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i>, if not for the mercy and compassion which <i>HaKadosh
Baruch Hu</i> shows to His loved ones. The <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> (<i>Breishis Rabbah</i>
86) similarly analogizes Yaakov's descent to a cow being forced to the slaughterhouse.
Although the cow will initially resist with all of its might, it will
ultimately submit if it sees its calf being brought to the slaughterhouse.
Similarly, <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> forced Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> to descend to <i>Mitzrayim</i>
by first bringing his beloved son, Yosef, down to <i>Mitzrayim</i>.</p>

<P>
The Rashbam infers the compulsory nature of Yaakov <i>Avinu's</i>
descent from <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu's</i> placation of his fears: "<i>al
tira meireda Mitzrayma</i> - have no fear of descending to Egypt (<i>Bereishes</i> 46:3)."
Through this statement, <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> assuaged Yaakov's fears
by guaranteeing him that everything that He does is for the best, as R' Akiva
states in <i>Maseches Berachos</i> (60b): <i>kol d'avid Rachmana 'tav
avid</i>.</p>

<P>In a
related vein, the Sanzer Rebbe (cited by R' Asher Weiss, <i>Haggadas Minchas
Asher</i>, p. 393) cited this theme in explanation of the common practice of
covering one's eyes at the beginning of <i>keriyas Shema</i> (see <i>Berachos</i>
13b). In affirming "<i>Hashem Elokeinu Hashem Echad</i>," we note
the singularity and absolute unity of <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> in this world.
Although <i>din</i> (strict judgment) and <i>rachamim</i> (paternal compassion)
appear as distinct attributes to our imprecise perception, these entities are
truly one and the same. We thus cover our eyes to represent the fallibility of our
limited vision. As we acknowledge the unity of <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i>, we
will not allow ourselves to be "blinded" by the apparent existence
of suffering and travail in this world.</p>

<P>The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Taanis</i> 29A) teaches in the name of
Rav, that just as when the month of Av begins we curtail joy, so too when the
month of Adar begins we increase joy. What might be the lesson of connecting
and contrasting these two months - Av and Adar? Rav Chaim Yaakov Goldvicht <i>z"l</i>,
<i>Rosh </i>Yeshiva of <i>Kerem B'Yavneh</i>, suggested that <i>simcha</i>
is to be understood as being in the presence of Hashem. What caused the diminution
in the month of Av? The sin of the spies. The <i>Sfas Emes</i> and others
explain the thinking of the spies, that they were afraid to leave the spiritual
cocoon and womb of the dessert. In the dessert they were surrounded by Hashem's
supernatural manifestations daily in the form of the <i>mann</i>, <i>be'er</i>
of Miriam and the clouds of Glory which enveloped them providing them with air-conditioning
by day and heat by night. They were afraid to enter <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> to
live a natural lifestyle of planting and growing their own food, making their
own clothing and developing their human initiatives. Their refusal to see Hashem
in the everyday led <i>Chazal</i>, therefore, limit joy and happiness during
this time as a direct consequence of their action.</p>

<P>Purim represents the antithesis of the sin of the spies. The
<i>Gemara</i> (<i>Shabbos</i> 88 A) understands the verse in <i>Shemos</i> (19:17) "and they stood under the mountain" to be taken literally: that Hashem
covered them with the mountain and said to them "if you accept the Torah,
fine, if not your burial will be here". Rav Acha bar Yaakov said this
could very well serve as an excuse for anyone who does not observe the Torah,
for they could claim it was given to them under coercion. The <i>Meshech Chochma</i>
in his commentary on this verse teaches that one need not understand the above
lifting of the mountain literally, rather the Revelation at Sinai was so
powerfully real and pronounced, and they were so absolutely sure that Hashem Himself
spoke to them, that they had no choice but to accept the Torah. Rava said, nevertheless, that they accepted the Torah again in
the days of Achashverosh, as it says in the <i>Megillah</i> (9:27) "The Jews established and accepted." Which is understood to mean,
they established at Purim that which already had been accepted at Sinai.</p>

<P>The Purim story could well be understood as a series of
unrelated happenings; a string of coincidences that ultimately ended up well
for the Jewish people. Instead, the Jews recognized the Hand of Hashem as the Director
and Coordinator of everything that transpired. They saw Him in the everyday,
the opposite of the sin of the spies who refused to see Hashem in the everyday.</p>

<P>I'd like to suggest an additional approach to
appreciate the <i>yom tov</i> of Purim. Rav Chaim Friedlander <i>z"l</i>
in his <i>Sifsei Chaim</i> teaches that what appear at first to be all the crises
of the Purim story later become part of the salvation of the Jewish People. The
Purim story occurred over nine years, between the 3rd year of the reign of Achashverosh
and the 12th year. When Esther, a good Jewish woman, perhaps wife, (<i>Talmud Megillah</i>
13A) was taken against her will to the palace of the king, this was assessed as
a tragedy. When Mordechai refused to bow to Haman, this was viewed by many as a
source of trouble for the Jewish nation. When Haman readied the gallows to hang
Mordechai, this was perceived as a terrible impending danger. It was only at
the end that it was understood that each "negative" occurrence was
part of the Divine Plan. Purim portends that which the prophet Isaiah (35:5)
teaches "then the eyes of the blind will be opened." In the future,
in the days of <i>Mashiach</i>, we will see, understand and appreciate that
indeed all that we consider to be tragic and negative is, in reality, good and
positive. The teaching of Rav Akiva, <i>Berachos</i> (60A) "everything Hashem
does is for the good", which is now a tenet of faith but not exoteric,
will in the future be verified and substantiated.</p>

<P>The Talmud <i>Yerushalmi</i> (<i>Tannis</i> 2:2) teaches
that in the future all the holidays will cease except for Purim (this is echoed
by the Rambam <i>Hilchos Megillah</i> 2:18). Rav Shlomo Alkebetz, author of <i>Lecha
Dodi</i>, writes in his commentary to <i>Megillas</i> Esther (entitled <i>Manos
HaLevi</i>) that while all other holidays will always be observed, their
message will pale in comparison to Purim. All other holidays - <i>Pesach</i>,
<i>Shavuos</i>, and <i>Succos</i> - focus on the overt salvation, revelation
and deliverance of Hashem. Purim provides us with the preview that we will
appreciate all which has transpired in history; all the enigmas, frustrations
and challenges as one big "WOW!", all leading to the Glory of Hashem.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Resolving the <i>Sukkah</i> Paradox]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Benjamin Yudin]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2011]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: sukkos]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Every <i>yom tov
</i>has its own unique character. Regarding the holiday of <i>Sukkos</i> there
appears to be a basic contradiction between two conflicting themes. On the one
hand, the Maharil explains the reason that <i>Sukkos</i> comes following Yom
Kippur is that if it was decreed that an individual or community go into <i>golus</i>
- exile, as result of the judgment of Yom Kippur, they can serve this sentence
by exiting their homes for a seven day period, and reside in a temporary abode,
the <i>sukkah</i>. This teaching is found earlier in the <i>medrash</i> Yalkut Shimoni,
(<i>Vayikra</i> 653), in the name of Rebbe Eliezer <i>bar</i> Marnus, that if
the Jewish nation were judged to be exiled, their going into their <i>Sukkos</i>,
is considered On High as if they went to <i>Bavel</i>.</p>

<P>Moreover, this
concept of uprooting oneself and moving into a temporary dwelling as found in <i>halacha</i>.
The Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 8b) teaches that if one lives in a kosher <i>sukkah </i>all
year long, they cannot fulfill their mitzvah of <i>sukkah </i>by remaining in
that <i>sukkah</i>, but must leave their permanent <i>sukkah</i> and like all Israel, experience the phenomena of relocation and enter another <i>sukkah</i>.
This is codified in <i>Orach Chaim </i>(636:2). It is not sufficient that one
resides in a kosher <i>sukkah</i>; one has to experience literally the move.</p>

<P>Yet,
paradoxically, we find that <i>Sukkos</i> is defined as a most happy, joyous
festive holiday. The Yalkut (654) notes that the charge to be in a state of <i>simcha</i>
- happiness is found three times in the torah regarding the <i>yom tov</i> of <i>Sukkos</i>.
Interestingly, regarding Pesach there is no biblical directive for <i>simcha</i>,
and the holiday of <i>Shavuos</i> has <i>simcha</i> incorporated but once. The Zohar
(<i>Parshas Emor</i>) ascribes some of the special <i>simcha</i> of <i>Sukkos</i>,
to the seven <i>ushpizin</i> - privileged guests who join us daily in the <i>sukkah</i>.
What is perhaps most fascinating is the exception to the rule that exists regarding
the mitzvah of <i>sukkah</i>, namely that <i>mitztaer</i> - one who is
uncomfortable and pained by fulfilling the mitzvah of residing in the <i>sukkah</i>
- is exempt thereof. Regarding the observance of Jewish law we are generally
governed by (<i>Avos</i> 5:26) <i>lefum tzarah agrah</i>, i.e. the
reward is in proportion to the difficulty and exertion. If one does not enjoy
eating <i>matzah</i>, or when we had, and please G-d in the future will have,
the <i>korban Pesach</i>, their lack of enjoyment is not an exemption. The Yerushalmi
relates how some Ravs endured a headache from Pesach to <i>Shavuos</i> as a
result of drinking wine and not grape juice for the mitzvah of <i>daled kosos</i>.
Sitting in the <i>sukkah</i> is radically different. If one is troubled by
extreme weather conditions under which they would not remain even in their own
home, or if they are troubled by unpleasant odors or disturbing insects, the Shulchan
Aruch (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 640:4) rules that they are exempt from the <i>sukkah</i>
[except the first night that even under those conditions one is to eat a <i>kezayis</i>
in the <i>sukkah</i>].</p>

<P>At first glance
there appears to be a startling inconsistency whereby exile and leaving
one's comfortable home usually denotes hardships and sufferings bereft of
the conveniences of home. Yet in the <i>sukkah</i> we are mandated to merge
these divergent motifs.</p>

<P>The Torah (<i>Vayikra</i> 23:43) teaches that we are to reside in <i>Sukkos</i>
"<i>L'ma'an yeid'uh doroseichem ki ba'sukkos hoshafti
es Bnai Yisroel b'hotzi'ih osam mei'Eretz Mitzrayim</i> - so
that your generations will know that I caused the Children of Israel to dwell
in booths when I took them from the land of Egypt".
Rav Yosef Salant <i>zt"l</i>, in his Bear Yosef, notes that we are told
to relive and reenact, not simply remember the manner in which Hashem provided
for us in our forty year trek through the dessert. The <i>annei haKovod</i> -
Clouds of Glory provided millions of tRavelers in the dessert with perfect
climate control - air conditioning by day to protect them from the beating sun,
and heat by night to dispel the chill. Moreover, these clouds worked overtime
at night by providing fresh laundering and dry cleaning for their clothes. They
were provided miraculously with manna from heaven satisfying their individual
tastes and diets, and fresh drinking water was supplied in abundance despite
their location being far from any oasis. In their tRavels and exile from Egypt to the land of Israel,
Hashem provided them with all the comforts of home. It is for this reason,
explains the Bear Yosef, that if one is <i>mitztaer</i> - uncomfortable in the <i>sukkah</i>,
that they are exempt thereof as this would negate the positive characteristic
of <i>sukkah</i> of reliving His abundant kindnesses. This understanding of our
stay in the desert, after which our <i>mitzvas sukkah</i> is modeled, puts to
rest the <i>sukkah</i> paradox: through the <i>mitzvah</i> of<i> sukkah</i> we
reenact our desert experience, which included being in a form of <i>galus</i>
but also included Hashem's infinite kindness in making that <i>galus</i>
very comfortable.</p>

<P>While the <i>Beis
HaMikdash</i> certainly served multiple roles, the Rambam (<i>Sefer HaMitzvos</i>
20) seems to identify its ritualistic role as paradigmatic of the very essence
of the <i>Mikdash</i>, as he describes the <i>Mikdash</i> as a "<i>Beis Avodah</i>
- House of Service." The Rambam echoes this characterization in the
beginning of <i>Hilchos Avodas Beis HaBechira</i>, stating that <i>Bnei Yisrael</i>
are commanded to, "<i>la'asos bayis l'hashem, muchan l'hiyos
makrivim bo korbanos v'chogegin eilav shalosh pe'amim bashana shene'emar
'v'asu Li mikdash</i>' - build a house for Hashem, equipped
to offer sacrifices and celebrate festivals three times annually, as it is
stated, 'make for me a <i>Mikdash</i>'." By mentioning the
sacrificial obligations in the very opening line, the Rambam suggests that
these ritual services encapsulate the characteristic essence of the <i>Mikdash</i>.</p>

<P>The Ramban
(beginning of <i>Parshas Terumah</i>), however, appears to present a somewhat
different characterization of the <i>Mikdash</i>. Rather than emphasizing the
particularistic rituals, the Ramban underscores the <i>Mikdash's</i> more
general role as a resting place for the Divine Presence. In this respect, the Ramban
suggests a relationship between the <i>Mishkan</i> and Har Sinai, as the <i>Mishkan</i>
served to perpetuate the unparalleled level of closeness to the Divine Presence
achieved at <i>Har</i> Sinai.</p>

<P>This divergence
of opinions between the Rambam and the Ramban may be reflected elsewhere as
well. In the <i>Sefer HaMitzvos</i> (20), the Rambam reckons both the
construction of the actual <i>Mikdash</i> as well as the construction of its <i>keilim</i>
(vessels used to perform the services) as a single positive commandment. The Ramban
(33), however, argues that the construction of the <i>keilim</i> should be
counted independently of the construction of the actual edifice. The Ramban
adduces support for his argument from the <i>halachic</i> permissibility to
offer sacrifices in the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, even in the absence of <i>keilim</i>.
This dispensation suggests an independent status for the <i>Mikdash</i>,
irrespective of the mitzvah to build <i>keilim</i>.</p>

<P>R' Asher
Weiss suggests that the Rambam and Ramban's dispute regarding the
counting of the <i>mitzvos</i> mirrors their general dispute about the nature
of the <i>Mikdash</i>. Because the Rambam sees the Avodah as central to the
very definition of the <i>Mikdash</i>, he views the construction of the <i>keilim</i>
(which are necessary to perform the <i>avodah</i>) as intrinsic to the
commandment to build a <i>Mikdash</i> itself. According to the Ramban, however,
the <i>Mikdash</i> maintains an independent purpose of housing the Divine
Presence, regardless of the requirement to build <i>keilim</i> for the <i>avodah</i>.
Hence, the mitzvah to build the <i>keilim</i> deserves independent recognition
from the mitzvah to construct the <i>Mikdash</i>.</p>

<P>R' Weiss
suggests a further consistency in the opinions of the Rambam and Ramban as
well. The Ramban (<i>Mitzvos SheShachach HaRav</i> 3) counts an independent <i>mitzvah</i>
of "<i>u'bechol asher amarti aleichem tishameiru</i> - Be careful
regarding everything I have said to you" (<i>Shemos</i> 23:13) - not to deviate from the prescribed order when first placing the <i>keilim</i> in
the <i>Mikdash</i>. The Rambam, however, does not reckon this commandment
independently among the six hundred thirteen. Because the Ramban understands
construction of the keilim as a distinct mitzvah from construction of the <i>Mikdash</i>,
he must count an additional mitzvah to teach the order of placement of the <i>keilim</i>.
The Rambam, however, considers the construction of the <i>Mikdash</i> and its <i>keilim</i>
to be a single mitzvah. Hence, the order in which the <i>keilim</i> must be
placed in the <i>Mikdash</i> would likely be included within this mitzvah as
well, and not need to be reckoned independently.</p>

<P>It is
noteworthy that, somewhat ironically, the Ramban's reckoning of "<i>u'bechol
asher amarti aleichem tishameiru</i>" as an independent mitzvah may
actually support the Rambam's understanding of the construction of the <i>keilim</i>.
If construction of the <i>keilim</i> constitutes part of the <i>mitzvah d'oraisa</i>
of "<i>v'assu Li Mikdash</i>," it is understandable that the
Torah should insist on a specific order in which the mitzvah should be
performed. According to the Ramban, however, construction of the <i>keilim</i>
is not a true "mitzvah," but merely a "<i>hechsher mitzvah</i>,"
a technical preparation necessary for the fulfillment of a mitzvah. If
constructing the <i>keilim</i> simply serves as a means to an end, perhaps the
Torah would not be quite as insistent on the order in which it is performed.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>
The Steipler <i>Gaon</i> (<i>Birchas Peretz</i>, <i>Vayikra</i>)
notes that some <i>mitzvos</i> are voluntary, rather than obligatory, based on
the generosity of spirit of the giver. Among these are the voluntary sacrifices
and the donations for the <i>Mishkan</i>, which have no prescribed amounts, or <i>shiurim</i>,
even for those who choose to do them, and the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>nazir</i>.
There are also obligatory <i>mitzvos</i> without <i>shiurim</i>, such as <i>peah</i>,
<i>bikkurim</i>, <i>re'aiyon</i> and <i>gemilus chasadim</i>. Here too,
the <i>shiurim</i> are left up to the generosity of the giver. In this
way, they are similar to <i>terumah</i>, where Biblically, <i>chitah achas poteres
es ha'kri - </i>a single grain redeems the entire heap of produce.
However, asks the Steipler, if these <i>mitzvos</i> are necessary for the
proper service of Hashem, why were they or their <i>shiurim</i> not made
obligatory after all? And if they are not necessary, why were they given at
all?</p>

<P>
The Steipler suggests that voluntary service for the sake
of Heaven is a critical element in the acquisition of <i>ahavas Hashem</i>,
love of God, in which we are all commanded. If commanded, it must be within our
grasp, yet how exactly can we be obligated in matters of the heart? What should
one of a more phlegmatic nature do, who is not able to rouse his heart to burn
with the love of God? <i>Mitzvos</i> of the heart are simply not as accessible,
nor as readily discharged, as external, active <i>mitzvos</i>. </p>

<P>
The Rambam addresses this question in <i>Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah</i>
(chapter 2), writing that one arrives at <i>ahavas Hashem</i> through
contemplating His incomparable greatness. The <i>Chovos HaLevavos</i> writes
that one must reflect on Hashem's goodness, on all the kindnesses He
performs for us. Yet, for one whose heart is too dull to be roused by these
means, the question remains: How can he too achieve the mitzvah of loving God
with all his heart and soul and means? </p>

<P>
The Steipler answers by way of a concept developed in
Chapter 7 of the <i>Mesilas Yesharim</i>: just as the effects of one's
inner flame extend outward, rousing one to zeal in one's actions, the
effects of one's zealous actions can penetrate inward, rousing even a
dull heart to fervor. This phenomenon is at work, too, with the love of God - just
as inner love leads to voluntary service, where one foregoes his will in favor
of the will of <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i>, so too, voluntary, selfless acts in
service of the Divine rouse one's heart to love and be bound up with Hashem.
The more one invests in this voluntary outer service, the more one stokes the
fire of his inner of love of Hashem. As this is a tried and tested method, it
emerges that one is always capable of ultimately fulfilling the <i>mitzvos</i>
of the heart by engaging wholeheartedly in the voluntary <i>mitzvos</i>. And,
in contradistinction to obligatory <i>mitzvos</i>, which all too often are
performed in the manner of one paying off a debt, it is quite possible that the
fact that these voluntary <i>mitzvos</i> are so superbly suited to rouse
one's love of Hashem is their very <i>raison d'etre</i>. </p>

<P>
In this way, suggests the Steipler, converts and <i>ba'alei
teshuvah</i> have an advantage over other Jews. Having come to <i>mitzvos</i>
initially through a free-willed acceptance, they often continue to see
themselves in the same light even after accepting the yoke of <i>mitzvos</i>,
and this free-willed acceptance and devotion continually feed the fires of
their love and attachment to Hashem, which in turn may lead to greater care in
the performance of all <i>mitzvos</i> (see Tosafos, <i>Meseches Kidushin</i>
70b, s.v. <i>kashim geirim</i>).</p>

<P>
The Rokeach famously stated that piety never matches its
initial levels. This is apparently for the reasons discussed above, namely that
piety's inception is accompanied by one's choice to become closer
to Hashem, which engenders enormous heartfelt devotion. With the passage of time,
however, rote performance - and even additional levels of service, beyond the
letter of the law - inevitably come to feel obligatory, dulling one's
initial inspiration.</p>

<P>
It is in this vein that the Torah commands us to freely
give to the full measure of our hearts' devotion.</p>

<P>The Talmud (<i>Bava Metziah</i> 62A) cites a famous legal-moral
debate. Two individuals are in a perilous situation in a desert: one has a
supply of water that is sufficient to sustain one person and enable him to
reach civilization, but they will both die if he shares it. Ben P'turah
opines that the owner is to share his water and "not witness the death of
his comrade." Let the owner die with him if necessary, but he should not
withhold the source of life from his friend. Rav Akiva rules that the owner
of the water must drink the water himself, as his life takes precedence over
the next one. He bases this on a verse from <i>Parshas Behar</i>, (<i>Vayikra</i>
25:36) "<i>V'chai achicha imach </i>- let your brother live with
you"; the "with you" teaching of the verse compels the owner
to save himself first. </p>

<P>
The Chasam Sofer in his work Toras Moshe asks the following
question: the <i>passuk</i> says (<i>Vayikra</i> 9:18):
"<i>v'ahavta l'reiacha komocha</i> - you shall love your fellow
as yourself", to which Rashi adds the teaching of Rav Akiva that this
verse is a "<i>Klal gadol baTorah</i>" a major principle of Torah.
Are not the two teachings of Rav Akiva contradicting one another? The first Torah
directive taught that each man comes first before his fellow, and the latter
teaches they are of equal status. The answer, says Chasam Sofer, lies in the
word "<i>baTorah.</i>" Rav Akiva teaches that in the realm of the
physical, man is obligated to save himself first. However, in the spiritual realm
he is to treat the next one as oneself. </p>

<P>
This dictates that one is obligated to interrupt his own <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>talmud</i> Torah to teach and share Torah with others. Rav
Akiva was especially sensitive to this point. The Talmud (<i>Yevamos</i> 62B)
teaches that 24,000 students of Rav Akiva died during the weeks between <i>Pesach</i>
and <i>Shavuos</i> because they were not respectful to one another. I was
always troubled by this lack of respect. Could it be for not holding the door,
or saying "Good Morning", they warranted such Divine wrath? The Medrash
(<i>Koheles Rabbah </i>11: 6) clarifies their character flaw. Rav Akiva was privileged,
according to the medrash, to start again in the dusk of his life with seven
students. He told them to beware not to emulate the negative nature of his
former students who were <i>tzarei ayin</i> (selfish) in their study of Torah,
not sharing with one another what each had individually received from their
master and teacher.</p>

<P>
Torah that is not shared is not genuine Torah. The Rav Yosef
Karo rules in <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach </i>Chaim 47:4) that one is not
to study Torah prior to reciting the blessings of Torah. However, <i>hirhur </i>-
thinking about, meditating over Torah thoughts is permissible, as in that state
it cannot be shared. This is in contrast to writing Torah, as taught in 47:2,
which requires the prior blessings as the written word can be shared. </p>

<P>
It is thus understandable why these potential leaders and transmitters
of Torah, the students of Rav Akiva, received deadly punishment, as they
negated the teaching (<i>Mishlei</i> 4:22) "for
Torah is life to those who find them." Their withholding Torah from one
another was akin to the withholding of spiritual life and growth, and thus they
received Divine retribution measure for measure. </p>

<P>
The Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 49B) commenting on the well-known
verse (<i>Mishlei </i>31:26) "she opens her mouth with wisdom and the Torah
of kindness is upon her tongue", asks: is there a Torah of kindness and a
Torah that is devoid of kindness? The Talmud answers that Torah that is studied
with the intention of teaching it to others is the Torah of kindness. However,
Torah that is studied without the intention of sharing it with others is
considered a Torah bereft of kindness.</p>

<P>
Rav Yochanan ben Zakkai taught (<i>Avos</i> 2:8), "if
you have studied much Torah, do not take credit for yourself- <i>al tachzik tovah
l'atzmecha-</i> because that was what you were created to do". The <i>Medrash</i>
Shmuel, citing the Lev Avos, explains "<i>al tachzik tovah</i>"to
mean "don't hoard the good (Torah) for yourself." One who has
Torah knowledge must share it with others. Our Ravs teach on the verse in (<i>Iyov</i>
5:7) "man is born for toil- <i>l'amel yulad</i>" which is
understood to mean "<i>lilmod al menas l'lamed"</i>, to study
in order to teach.</p>

<P>
Lest one fear that by sharing with others they will lose out
in terms of their personal potential growth, the Chasam Sofer has a most novel intriguing
comment regarding Avraham <i>Avinu</i> and his receiving prophecy. Prior to Hashem
informing him of the impending destruction of Sedom, the Torah allows us to be
privy to Hashem's deliberation as to whether he should share this with Avraham.
The Chasam Sofer explains that Hashem decides to award Avraham the prophecy in <i>Bereishis</i>
(18:19) not for Avraham's self development, but rather because He
realized that Avraham has been engaged in <i>kiruv,</i> by teaching charity and
justice to multitudes of students, at the expense of his own personal growth.
Indeed many Ravs and teachers have been privileged to share in this blessing
of Avraham, and despite their primary focus being on the building of community
and students, they have merited Divine providence in their own religious
growth.</p>

<P>
Finally, let us not forget Rav Preida. The Talmud (<i>Eruvin</i>
54b) tells us that he had a student to whom he would have to repeat each lesson
four hundred times before the student understood it. One day the teacher had to
leave to attend to a <i>mitzvah</i>. Before leaving, he taught his student the
usual four hundred times, but he still did not grasp the lesson. When asked why
he did not grasp the lesson, the <i>talmid</i> explained that since he knew Rav
Preida was leaving, his attention was distracted because he was fearful that at
any moment his Rebbe would leave. Rav Preida then taught him another four
hundred times, and a <i>Bas Kol</i> (Heavenly Voice) asked, "Rav Preida,
do you prefer that four hundred years be added to your life, or that you and
your generation merit the life of the world to come?" Rav Preida chose
the latter, and in reward for his selflessness Hashem gave him both!</p>

<P>
May we be privileged to implement <i>v'ahavta l'reiacha
ka-mocha, zeh klal gadol <u>baTorah.</u></i></p>

<P>In <i>parshas Bo</i> (<i>Shemos</i> 12:51), we read with excitement "it happened on that very day, Hashem took the children of Israel
out of the land of Egypt." The Exodus is not only at the root of our
performance of many <i>mitzvos (tefillin, sukkah, Shabbos</i>), but indeed it
is the first of the <i>aseres hadibros</i> (Ten Commandments) wherein we are commanded
to believe in G-d "Who has taken you out of the land of Egypt, from the
house of slavery" (<i>Shemos</i> 20:2). </p>

<P>Rav Nosson Tzvi Finkel <i>zt"l</i>, the Alter of Slabodka,
highlights the connection between the Exodus and Hashem as the Creator. The
question is asked why Hashem did not introduce Himself as the Creator in the
first of the <i>aseres hadibros</i>? Rav Finkel suggests that in fact, He does,
as the Exodus sheds new light on creation.</p>

<P>The Ravs inform us that the back-breaking servitude ended
months before the actual exodus (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 11a). Why, then, were we
kept for an additional half year? To learn of the personal relationship that each
individual has with Hashem. The nine plagues that preceded the killing of
the first-born were not only punitive to the Egyptians (measure for measure),
but were also educational for the Jewish nation. The Jews were taught through
the plagues which preceded the Exodus that not only there is a G-d Who "plays
a role in the midst of the land" (<i>Shemos</i> 8:18), but also that He is the Creator and creates, on an ongoing basis, a personalized creation for
each individual. </p>

<P>Rav Finkel cites the following examples of a personalized
creation for each individual within the plagues:</p>

<P>
<ol>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Regarding the plague of Blood: not only did Hashem
     distinguish the Jewish nation by maintaining their water supply as water
     and transforming the water to blood for the Egyptians, but also if a Jew
     and Egyptian were drinking from a glass with two straws at the very same
     moment, the Jew continued to drink water, and the Egyptian blood. This is
     a personalized act of creation. That a Jew was able to sell water to an
     Egyptian showed a personalized act of creation on the part of Hashem for
     the Jew at that moment.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Regarding the plague of <i>Dever</i>: Moshe warns Pharaoh
     (<i>Shemos</i> 9:4) "not a thing that belongs to the children of Israel
     will die". Thus if an Egyptian had one animal that he had stolen
     from a Jew amidst his hundred animals, ninety-nine died but one survived. Even
     if the Jew had only part ownership in an animal, it did not die. These were
     personalized acts of His <i>Hashgacha Pratis</i>- Divine Providence.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The hail, we are taught, was a miracle within a miracle.
     Not only was the intensity of the hail unprecedented, but fire and water/ice
     were intermingled, co-existing to perform the will of Hashem (<i>Shemos Rabbah</i>
     12:4). Hashem created this new phenomenon to punish the Egyptians, and to
     teach the Jewish nation that He not only "renews creation on a daily
     basis" (as we recite every morning at the conclusion of the first
     blessing before the <i>Shema</i>) but He renews creation at every moment
     for each individual.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>In the plague of darkness, each Egyptian was paralyzed due
     to the intensity of the darkness, and each Jew had the gift of creation to
     function in his usual way. Similarly, the splitting of the Red Sea
     included personalized acts of creation in that it was dry land for each
     Jew and water for each Egyptian.</li>
</ol>
</P>
<P>Thus, when Hashem mentions the Exodus in the first of the <i>aseres
hadibros</i>, He is not only reminding the Jewish People of the favor they owe
Him for liberating them from slavery. Rather, He is informing them that He has
a personalized relationship with every individual and renews creation
constantly for each one personally. The <i>Hakaras Hatov</i> (personal
appreciation) that one must have is truly "<i>kol haneshama t'hallel
ka</i>" (Psalms 150:6) - a<i>l kol nishima v'nishima</i>- for every
breath, we owe Him a thank you.</p>

<P>In this same vein, we are taught in <i>Sanhedrin</i> (37A)
"that each individual is obligated to say and believe that the world was
created for me" and Ben Zoma (<i>Brachos</i> 58A) teaches that a good
guest says "how much trouble my Host took for my sake." Just as the
Torah states (<i>Braishis</i> 32:32) "the sun rose for him"
(Yaakov), each Jew is to feel gratitude daily to Hashem for <i>his</i> sunrise.
Indeed, each morning the <i>bracha</i> is in the present "Who spreads out
the earth upon the waters" because there is an ongoing creation.</p>

<P>Too often people lack a personalized relationship with Hashem.
If we only realized that all day long there is a tailor-made personal creation
for each of us, we would connect very differently with prayer. </p>

<P>I believe that this has a very practical lesson for all. Not
only in terms of our personal belief and relationship, but in the way we relate
to others. Schools open with the promise of personalized attention for each
student. Most often the system itself doesn't allow this to occur. Hashem
is the exception. Thus the directive, the 611th mitzvah of <i>v'halachta
b'drachav</i>- to walk in His ways- is not only to do kindness, but to
act to each individual, child, and student, differently, realizing that they
are unique. The rule with Hashem is that there is no limiting set of rules.</p>

<P><I>Parshas Pinchas</i> is always read in conjunction with the fast of <i>Shiva Asar B'Taamuz</i>.
This year being a leap year, the fast occurs this forthcoming Tuesday. At first
glance the beginning of the <i>parsha</i> focuses on the goal of the three
weeks, i.e. to restore <i>shalom</i> - true peace - between Hashem and the
Jewish people. Pinchas takes action, indeed what is referred to as an act of
zealotry, and this restores the peace. In our day as well, we yearn for the
redemption, the restoration of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, and the unification
of the Jewish people.</p>

<P>
Moshe teaches (<i>Devarim</i> 32:7) "<i>zechor yemos olam,
binu shenos dor vador - </i>remember the days of old, understand the years of
generation after generation", study history and learn well its lessons.
I'd like to analyze one aspect of the cause of the destruction of the <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i>. As we know there is a gradual build- up of intensity of mourning,
and restrictions that reflect this mourning, in the period between the <i>Shiva
Asar B'Taamuz</i> and <i>Tisha B'av</i>. Starting on <i>Shiva Asar B'Taamuz</i>
we abstain from haircuts and weddings; once the month of <i>Av</i> arrives, we intensify
the mourning and the refrain from eating meat, drinking wine, and laundering clothes;
on the night and morning of <i>Tisha B'av</i> we sit on the ground as mourners.
However, on <i>Tisha B'av</i> at <i>chatzos hayom</i> (1:01 PM this
year) something very strange occurs. At that moment we arise off the floor and
the intensity of the mourning subsides. Why? It is at that moment namely in the
afternoon, that the Romans set the Temple ablaze! As such, one would have expected an intensification, not a reduction,
of the mourning, since this corresponds to the actual moment of destruction!?</p>

<P>
The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 31b) explains this with
the teaching of Avimai. The Psalmist (79:1) begins his psalm depicting the
destruction of the Temple and Jerusalem with
the words "<i>Mizmor l'Assaf</i> - a song to A'ssaf."
One would have expected the psalm to begin with the word "<i>kina</i> - a
lamentation"! A'ssaf answers that Hashem directed his anger and
vengeance towards "wood and stones", the physical temple, and by
destroying the temple He spared
the people and stopped the human destruction. Hence the lessening of mourning
at this time, in recognition of our losing the <i>eitzim</i> and <i>avanim</i> -
sticks and stones - but our people live on.</p>

<P>
The sticks and stones of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> were no
ordinary edifice. The Rama, Rav Moshe Isserles, in his <i>Toras Haolah</i>
writes that Plato the Greek philosopher accompanied Nevuchadnetzer to destroy
the first <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>. After the destruction, Plato met the prophet
Jeremiah crying over the Temple ruins. The philosopher asked
the prophet, why are you mourning over a building, over sticks and stones?
Jeremiah then asked Plato if he had any unresolved philosophical issues. Plato
responded with a list of complex problems. The prophet addressed each one and
precisely and methodically resolved all his questions. Plato was astonished and
could not believe that any man could be so wise. Jeremiah pointed to the Temple ruins
and said "all of my knowledge I derived from these stick and
stones".</p>

<P>
The late Rav Shimshon Pincus <i>z"l</i> explained in a
most poignant way why we lost the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>. The <i>Mishnah</i> (<i>Avos</i> 3:22)
teaches in the name of Rebi Elazar <i>ben</i> Azariah "one whose wisdom
exceeds his good deeds is compared to a tree with many branches but with few
roots; such a tree is easily uprooted by the wind. But one whose good deeds
exceed his wisdom is likened to a tree with few branches but with many roots
that all the winds cannot uproot." At the time of the destruction of the Temple, the <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i> had not changed - it was still the great repository of wisdom.
The very existence of a residence for the Almighty is most difficult to
comprehend, as King Solomon expressed (<i>Melachim</i> I 8:27),
"behold the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you, much less
this Temple that I
have erected". Our Ravs therefore utilize the concept of <i>tzimtzum</i>
meaning while "the whole world is filled with his glory" (<i>Yeshaya</i>
6:3), there is a greater concentration of His essence and presence in the <i>Mikdash</i>.
A further proof that the <i>Mikdash</i> was the storehouse of wisdom is that we
conclude every <i>shemoneh esrei</i> with the prayer that the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>
be rebuilt, speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Torah. Why do we
connect the rebuilding of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> with our being granted our
share in Torah? Surely Torah study is independent of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> service!
By making this connection we are reaffirming our belief that when the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>
is rebuilt, there will not only be the resumption of the <i>avodah</i> - service,
but also that special heavenly enlightenment will again emanate from the <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i>.</p>

<P>
What changed at the time of the <i>churban</i> was the
people. The breakdown of man to man relations, characterized by <i>sinas chinum</i>
- gratuitous hatred, as portrayed in the <i>Talmud</i> (<i>Yoma</i> 9b),
coupled with the idolatrous practices of the people as portrayed by the
prophets Yeshaya, Jeremiah, and Yechezkel, diminished the quantitative and
qualitative nature of their good deeds. They were no longer a worthy <i>beis kibul</i>
- receptacle - for this special wisdom. They became that tree with many
branches and few roots. Hashem had two choices. He could destroy the people or
diminish the light and wisdom that emanated from the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>.
Fortunately, He chose the latter. This is what we mourn on <i>Tisha B'av</i>,
the loss of the close relationship between the Jewish nation and Hashem.
However, we rise at <i>chatzos</i> to breathe that sigh of relief that we
survived though impaired, and we yearn and commit ourselves for the restoration
<i>Beis Hamikdash</i>.</p>

<P>
It is somewhat frightening to see the parallel in our
contemporary society. Someday we will understand why our generation was endowed
with exceptional wisdom and capabilities. The automobile, airplane, cellphone,
incredible advances in medicine, laser surgery, in-utero surgery, and space
exploration all reflect the technological explosions of our time. The hard
question that we must ask ourselves is: are our deeds commensurate with this
wisdom? Are we using these blessings to become more benevolent and magnanimous,
more humble and moral, recognizing that they are a divine gift meant to enhance
society if utilized properly? Are our deeds-roots more numerous than our
knowledge? Or are we primarily channeling these gifts to satisfy our personal
passions of greed and lust? The question must be addressed by society at large,
but especially the Jewish community has to wrestle with the above.</p>

<P>
The Talmud (<i>Taanis</i> 30b) teaches, "all who mourn
for Jerusalem will
merit witnessing her joy, and all those who do no mourn for Jerusalem will
not merit to witness her joy". Mourning for Jerusalem means
revisiting the causes for her destruction. The generation that lost the <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i> had much wisdom but simply could not utilize it properly and
contain it. May we learn from the mistakes of yesteryear and prove our actions
worthy of supporting and maintaining the third <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> speedily
in our days.</p>

		<date><![CDATA[2011]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: toldos]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P><i>Parshas Toldos</i> is the one <i>parsha</i> that focuses
on Yitzchak <i>Avinu</i>. We see the special <i>hashgacha pratis</i> that
accompanied him. Unlike his father who in the face of the adversity of famine
went down to Egypt, Hashem prohibits the holy Yitzchak from leaving the Holy
 Land. In just that year of famine we read "<i>Vayizra Yitzchak bo'oretz
ha'hee vayimtza bashana ha'hee me'ah shearim vayevaracheihu Adonay</i>
- Yitzchak sowed in that land, and in that year he reaped a hundred fold, thus
had Hashem blessed him" (<i>Breishis</i> 26:12.) I'd like to focus
on the nature of the blessings that Hashem bestowed on Yitzchak.</p>

<P>Thrice in <i>parshas Toldos</i> Hashem blesses Yitzchak. The
first two are most special, but they are what one might characterize as "left
handed compliments". In the first blessing (26:4) Yitzchak is assured
that his offspring will be like the stars, and they will possess the land. Why?
(26:5) "<i>Eikeve asher shoma Avraham b'kolee vayishmor mitzvosai, chukosai,
v'Torosai </i>- because Avraham obeyed My voice and observed My
safeguards, My commandments, My decrees and My Torah's." While it
is quite explicit that Yitzchak is assured an incredible inheritance, Hashem is
not necessarily blessing Yitzchak because he has earned it or deserves it. The
second time that Yitzchak is blessed follows the same pattern. In (26:24) Hashem
appears to him that night and said "<i>Anochi Elohei Avraham Avicha al tira
ki itcha anochi u'bairachticha v'hirbeisi es zaracha ba'avor Avraham
avdee</i> - I am the G-D of your father Avraham, fear not for I am with you, I
will bless you and increase your offspring because of Avraham my
servant." Once again, Yitzchak is assured of a bright future, but not as
a reward for any personal accomplishments. </p>

<P>This formula of <i>beracha</i> changes with the third <i>beracha</i>
(26:28). Here the Torah expresses the success that Yitzchak has experienced,
and the notice thereof amongst the community at large, as articulated by Avimelech
king of the Plishtim, "<i>Ra'oh ra'enu ki haya Adonai imach</i>
- we have indeed seen that Hashem has been with you." Here there are no
strings attached. This time Yitzchak is noteworthy of blessing independent of
his illustrious father. What has transpired between the second and the third
blessing to manifest this change? </p>

<P>The Seforno in his commentary (26:5) posits the following
exciting thesis: when Hashem explains to Yitzchak the first time that he is
being blessed in the merit of his father, since his father "<i>v'yishmor
mishmarti</i> - observed my safeguards", this does not refer to the
stringencies and exactitude in which Avraham fulfilled <i>mitzvos</i>, rather
it refers to Avraham partnering with Hashem in advancing and emulating His ways,
as referenced by Psalms (25:10) "all the paths of Hashem are kindness and
truth". Avraham did so by extending exemplary hospitality and educating
the masses regarding monotheism, as the Torah testifies (12:8) "<i>V'yikrah
b'shaim Hashem"</i>, which is understood by the Ramban to mean that
he preached to whoever would listen.</p>

<P>What changes now in the life of Yitzchak, notes the Seforno,
is that after the second blessing the Torah highlights (26:25) "<i>Vayiven
shom mizbeach vayikra b'shem Adonai</i> - he built an alter there,
invoked Hashem by name". Now Yitzchak entered and extended the family
business of outreach. Now he is worthy of <i>beracha</i> independently.
Moreover, the Seforno explains that we do not ever find Yaakov being blessed in
the merit of his father because the description of Yaakov as an (25:27) "<i>Ish
tom yoshev ohalim</i> - a wholesome man, abiding in tents" indicates that
he both studied and taught knowledge and Torah to the masses, especially at the
yeshiva of Shem and Aiver which was the center of spirituality of its day, and
as such always independently merited <i>beracha</i>.</p>

<P>A most important lesson emerges from the Seforno. In order
to get <i>beracha</i> one has to give. Commenting on the familiar verse in <i>Aishes
Chayil</i> (<i>Mishlei</i> 31:26), "<i>V'toras chesed al l'shonah</i>
- and the Torah of kindness is her tongue". The Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 49b)
comments that a Torah that is shared is a Torah of <i>chesed</i>, and one that
is not shared is lacking <i>chesed</i>. </p>

<P>The entering of Yitzchak into the <i>kiruv</i> industry
portrays the immutable principle that <i>kiruv</i>-outreach is an endeavor that
is open to all and, more succinctly, incumbent on all. One does not have to be
an outreach professional to reach out and touch someone. Each and every person
who is observant of Torah and <i>mitzvos</i> can by their very persona
positively communicate and transmit Torah values and mores. The Talmud (<i>Yoma</i>
86a) understands that the obligation to love Hashem (<i>Devarim</i> 6:5) is not
limited to one's own individual relationship with Him, but also requires
that as a result of one's pleasant demeanor and manners, others come to
love Hashem through you. Thus, the workplace can serve as a positive
environment for outreach.</p>

<P>The responsibility of <i>kiruv</i> is certainly included in
the Biblical verse (<i>Devarim</i> 22:2) where the Torah obligates a Jew to
return a lost object to his fellow. The Talmud (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 73a) deduces
that if one must return a monetary object, certainly they must restore if
possible ones physical health. The logical but fundamental extension is that
one must also endeavor to return the next person's soul to its pristine spiritual
state. Avraham's nature was most different than that of Yitzchak. This is
precisely what the Torah is teaching us, that each individual in his own way
should consciously engage in outreach to the not yet affiliated and not yet
observant.</p>

<P>Finally, the lack of time is no excuse. Rav Moshe Feinstein <i>zt"l</i>
(<i>Igros Moshe, Evan Haezer</i> 4:26) states that just as one is obligated to
tithe their physical resources, so too are they obligated to invest a tenth of
their time and activities to enhance and enrich the Torah life of others.
Oftentimes one's hosting guests for a Shabbos or
Yom Tov meal can make a significant impact on their lives. I'm not sure
that <i>kiruv</i> came easily or naturally to Yitzchak, but I do know that it
made a significant and blessed difference in his life.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The <I>mishnah (Pesachim</I> 116:b) mandates that in every generation a person is
obligated to look at himself as though he personally departed from
Egypt. The Rambam, (<I>Hilchos Chametz U'matzah</I> 7:6,7) cites
this command as the reason for our reclining and drinking four cups
of wine at the <I>seder</I>. The Alter of Slabodka is purported to
have said that this is the most challenging <I>mitzvah</I> of the
night of <I>Pesach</I>.  
</P>

<P>At first glance, the <I>mishnah</I> is teaching that the level of <I>hakoras
hatov</I> we must all have at the <I>seder</I> is not simply for what He did for our ancestors
and that we would not be where we are today were it not for His
kindnesses afforded them, rather, we must look at the exodus and
express a personal <I>hakoras hatov</I> for what He did for us. 
</P>

<P>The <I>birkas ha-gomel</I>, thanksgiving blessing, is mandated by the Talmud
(<I>Berachos</I> 54b) for the following four survivors: (a) one who
completed a sea journey (b) one who completed a hazardous land
journey such as crossing a dessert, (c) one who recovered from a
serious illness (d) one released from captivity. Interestingly, our
meal at the <I>seder</I> is upgraded to a <I>seudas ho'da'ah - </I>meal
of thanksgiving, as upon leaving Egypt we successfully experienced
all four. The Alshich asks, if the motivation and cause for the
thanksgiving is appreciation for what Hashem has done, than in
reality we should be reciting this blessing constantly, as his
kindnesses are with us always. Therefore, he teaches it is not only
the salvation from these threatening circumstances, but as the verse
in <I>Tehillim</I> (107:24) which is the scriptural source for this
blessing states "they have seen the deeds of Hashem". When one
hears of the salvation that another experienced, it bolsters their
faith in G-D, and His personal involvement in the affairs of man.
When however, an individual experiences a personal life-saving
situation, they are giving thanks for the privilege of <U>seeing</U>
G-D first hand. A miraculous outcome for someone else solidifies my
belief intellectually, but when I am the direct recipient of His
kindness my <I>Emunah-</I>faith is elevated to a tangible
experiential level.</P>

<P><I>Tehillim</I> (33:1) states: "<I>ranenu tzadikim Ba'Shem</I> - sing joyfully oh
righteous because of Hashem." The <I>Medrash</I> Shocher Tov points
out that it does not say "<I>el</I> Hashem" which would mean sing
to Hashem, rather <I>Ba'Shem</I>, understood that as soon as they are
privileged to <U>see</U> the Devine they sing. Thus, we find
immediately prior to the miraculous rescue at <I>Yam Suf</I>, (<I>Shemos
</I>14:31) "Israel <U>saw</U> the great hand that Hashem inflicted
upon Egypt", and immediately thereafter, (15:1) "then Moshe and
the children of Israel sang this song". We also find at the opening
day ceremony to the inauguration of the <I>Mishkan</I> that the Torah teaches (<I>Vayikra</I> 9:24), "A fire went
forth from before Hashem, the people <U>saw</U>, and sang glad song".
Similarly, the prophet Micha (7:15) promises "as in the days when
you left the land of Egypt, I will <U>show</U> it (Jewish people)
wonders". And lastly, we also pray in the daily in every <I>shemoneh
esrei</I>, "may our <U>eyes</U> witness Your return to Zion".</P>

<P>The Talmud (<I>Berachos</I> 12a) explains why the <I>Shema</I> in the morning is
followed by the blessing of <I>Emes veyatziv</I>, while that of the
night is followed by <I>Emes v'emunah</I>, by citing the <I>passuk
</I>(<I>Tehillim</I> 92:3) "to relate your kindness in the morning
and your faith at night." Why do we focus on "kindness" in the
morning but on "faith" at night? Daytime represents clarity, when
one can see and comprehend with certainty; things are "clear as
day", as the saying goes. This refers to the kindnesses and
miracles that He performed for us. Nighttime, however, indicates the
doubt and uncertainty we may have as to when and how we will be
extricated from our communal and personal challenges. As such,
nighttime is a time to draw upon one's faith that redemption-
<I>geulah</I> will come. 
</P>

<P>The majority of <I>mitzvos</I> - <I>shofar, lulav, tefillin, hallel</I> - are all
day <I>mitzvos</I>, reflecting the positive and open relationship
between Hashem and Israel. Why, asks the Vilna <I>Gaon</I> in his
<I>Oros HaGrah</I>, are the <I>mitzvos</I> of <I>Pesach</I> - eating
the <I>korban Pesach,</I> <I>matzoh,</I> and <I>marror</I> - all
night <I>mitzvos</I>? His answer is that the night of <I>Pesach</I>
is philosophically and <I>halachically</I> a day. Similarly the <I>Gaon</I>
explains that although the Torah says (<I>Shemos</I> 13:8), "you
shall tell your son on that <U>day</U>" when describing the <I>mitzvah</I>
of <I>sippur yetzias mitzraim</I>, we fulfill this <I>mitzvah</I> at
night since this night is axiologically a day. We experienced on this
night His presence with such clarity that the character of this night
was forever transformed from a night of faith to a virtual daytime of
seeing.</P>

<P>
Thus, the charge to "<U>look</U> at oneself as if they personally
left Egypt" means not only to attempt to put oneself back in time
over three thousand years ago, but rather to know with absolute
surety that Hashem, the Honored Guest at our seder, will solve our
communal and personal pressing problems.</P>

		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: yk]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The Talmud (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 90B) relates a dialogue between
Roman philosophers and Rav Yehoshua ben Chananya. The philosophers asked him
for a biblical source that Hashem will resurrect the dead, and that He knows
what will be in the future. He answered that both principles emerged from the
following verse (<i>Devarim</i> 31:6), "Hashem said to Moshe, behold you
will lie with your fathers and rise will this nation and stray after the G-ds
of the peoples of the land." The Talmud (<i>Yuma</i> 52a-b) teaches that
the word "<i>v'kom</i> - and rise" can be understood either
referring to the preceding phrase, thus teaching that Moshe will rise again,
hence a source for <i>t'chias ha-maysim</i> (the resurrection of the dead), or can
be understood to introduce the second half of the verse foretelling what will
be in the future. In any event, these two concepts are juxtaposed in the Torah.</p>

<P>Rav Yosef Salant <i>zt"l</i>, in his B'ear Yosef, asks
a fascinating question based upon the above. The Rambam teaches (<i>Hilchos
T'shuva </i>5:8) that Hashem's knowledge of all that will transpire
doesn't diminish man's free will. Based on the above, let us
examine G-d's creating of man. It is clear from the Torah that man was
created with the capacity to live forever. In (<i>Berashis</i> 2:17) we are
taught "But of the tree of knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat
thereof, for on the day you eat of it you shall surely die". G-d knew that
Adam would violate this command; He knew that man would become mortal. What
happened to His initial plan and desire that man be immortal? How could it be
that His plan would be thwarted?</p>

<P>The B'ear Yosef answers that His desire that man be eternal combined
with His knowledge that man will sin and bring death into the world caused
Hashem to incorporate a Plan B (<i>t'chias ha-maysim</i>) into creation. It is
interesting to note, that in chapter 2 of <i>Berashis</i> the word "<i>v'yeetzer</i>
- and He formed" is used twice in the chapter. In verse 7, when speaking
of the formation / creation of man, the word is spelled with two <i>yud</i>s; in
verse 19 regarding the creation of the animals, the same word is spelled with but
one yud. Rashi (v7) explains that the two <i>yud</i>s demonstrated that he was
formed initially with the capacity of two formations, one at the present time
and a second at the time of <i>t'chias ha-maysim</i>. At that time His initial
desire and plan regarding man's immorality will be actualized. Every morning,
we reiterate, (Proverbs 19:21) "Many designs are in man's heart, must the
council of Hashem, only it will prevail".</p>

<P>I believe the above teaching is applicable regarding the
mitzvah of <i>teshuva</i>. The Rambam (<i>Hilchos Teshuva</i> 7:5) teaches,
that the Torah (<i>Devarim</i> 30:1-3) "<i>hivticha</i>-promises/assures"
us that the Jewish nation will do <i>teshuva</i> and be redeemed.</p>

<P>Too often, going into <i>Yom Kippur</i> one could be
frustrated by, "been there, done that!" Hopefully, each individual
will sit down in solitude and absolute privacy, following the advice of the
Chayey Adom, and compose a list of shortcomings, sins, and manners that we wish
to confess, correct and more important abandon in the forthcoming year.
However, upon reflection they come to realize that many items on the list are
repeats. Can <i>teshuva</i> really happen? The answer is definitively yes! The Jewish
nation can and will do <i>teshuva</i>. Using the above model of <i>t'chias ha-maysim</i>,
Hashem both knows if our desires are sincere or not and assures us that if the
present set of circumstances does not work for the particular individual and
the particular challenge, "<i>harbei sheluchim l'aMokom - </i>many are avenues
are available to Him", to enable man to actualize his <i>teshuva</i>.
However, we don"t know what different circumstances will be orchestrated
from On High to enable us to do <i>teshuva</i>, or if they will be as pleasant
as the present environment. Therefore, be smart and seize the moment and do <i>teshuva
shelaimah</i> now.</p>

<P>Yom Kippur is always referred to in the plural - as <i>Yom
HaKippurim</i> -<i> </i>in the Torah, as both the living and the deceased are
judged on this day, thus reminding us of that which we affirm in the second
blessing of every <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> "He maintains his faith to those
who sleep in the dust". As He maintains His faith to them, we can rest
assured that He will assist us in our <i>teshuva</i>, if only we take the first
sincere step.</p>

<P>
While the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> served multiple roles, the Rambam
(<i>Sefer HaMitzvos</i>, <i>mitvas aseh</i> 20) seems to identify the
ritualistic role as paradigmatic of the very essence of the <i>Mikdash</i>. He
describes the <i>Mikdash</i> as a <i>Beis Avodah</i>
- a House of Service. We find that the Rambam echoes this characterization in
the beginning of <i>Hilchos Avodas Beis HaBechirah</i>, where he states that <i>Bnei
Yisrael</i> are commanded, "<i>Laasos bayis l'Hashem muchan lihiyosm
makrivim bo korbanos v'chogugin eilav shalosh p'amim bashanah shene'emar
v'asu Li mikdash</i> - to build a house for Hashem, equipped to offer
sacrifices and celebrate festivals three times annually, as it is stated,
'make for Me a <i>Mikdash</i>.'" By mentioning the
sacrificial obligations in the very opening line, the Rambam suggests that
these ritual services encapsulate the characteristic essence of the <i>Mikdash</i>.</p>


<P>
The Ramban (beginning of <i>Parshas Terumah</i>), however, appears
to present a somewhat different characterization of the <i>Mikdash</i>. Rather
than emphasizing the particularistic rituals, the Ramban underscores the <i>Mikdash's</i>
more general role as a resting place for the Divine Presence. In this respect,
the Ramban suggests a relationship between the <i>Mishkan</i> and <i>Har</i>
Sinai, as the <i>Mishkan</i> served to perpetuate the unparalleled level of
closeness to the Divine Presence achieved at <i>Har</i> Sinai.</p>


<P>
This divergence of opinions between the Rambam and the Ramban may
also be reflected elsewhere. In the <i>Sefer HaMitzvos</i> (<i>ibid</i>), the
Rambam reckons both the construction of the actual <i>Mikdash</i> as well as
the construction of its <i>keilim</i> (vessels used to perform the services) as
a single positive commandment. The Ramban (<i>mitvas aseh</i> 33) argues that
the construction of the <i>Keilim</i> should be counted independently of the
construction of the actual edifice. Therefore, he prefers to count it as a
"<i>hechsher mitzvah</i>" subsumed under the general Mitzvah of the
<i>avodah</i>. The Ramban adduces support for his argument from the <i>halachic</i>
permissibility to offer sacrifices in the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, even in the
absence of <i>keilim</i>. This dispensation suggests an independent status for
the <i>Mikdash</i>, irrespective of the Mitzvah to build <i>keilim</i>.</p>


<P>
Rav Asher Weiss suggests that the Rambam and Ramban's
dispute regarding the counting of the <i>mitzvos</i> mirrors their general
dispute about the nature of the <i>Mikdash</i>. Because the Rambam perceives
the <i>avodah</i> as central to the very definition of the <i>Mikdash</i>, he
views the construction of the <i>keilim</i> (which are necessary to perform the
<i>avodah</i>) as intrinsic to the commandment to build a Mikdash itself. According
to the Ramban, however, the <i>Mikdash</i> maintains an independent purpose of
housing the Divine Presence, regardless of the requirement to build <i>keilim</i>
for the <i>avodah</i>. Hence, the Mitzvah to build the <i>keilim</i> deserves
independent recognition from the Mitzvah to construct the <i>Mikdash</i>.</p>



<P>
Rav Weiss suggests a further consistency in the opinions of the
Rambam and Ramban. The Ramban (<i>Mitzvos SheShachach HaRav</i>, 3) counts an
independent <i>mitzvah</i> of "<i>u'vechol asher amarti aleichem
tishameiru</i>" (<i>Shemos</i> 23:13), not to
deviate from the prescribed order when first placing the <i>keilim</i> in the <i>Mikdash</i>.
The Rambam, however, does not reckon this commandment independently among the
613. Because the Ramban understands the construction of the <i>keilim</i> as a
distinct Mitzvah from construction of the <i>Mikdash</i>, he must count an
additional Mitzvah to teach the order of placement of the <i>keilim</i>. The
Rambam, however, considers the construction of the <i>Mikdash</i> and its <i>keilim</i>
to be a unified Mitzvah. Hence, the order in which the <i>keilim</i> must be placed
in the <i>Mikdash</i> would likely be included within this Mitzvah as well, and
not need to be reckoned independently.</p>



<P>
It is noteworthy that, somewhat ironically, the Ramban's
reckoning of "<i>u'vechol asher amarti aleichem tishameiru</i>"
as an independent <i>mitzvah</i> may actually support the Rambam's
understanding of the construction of the <i>keilim</i>. If construction of the <i>keilim</i>
constitutes part of the biblical <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>v'asu Li mikdash</i>,
it is understandable that the Torah should insist on a specific order in which
the Mitzvah should be performed. According to the Ramban, as we have stated,
construction of the <i>keilim</i> is not a true Mitzvah, but merely a <i>hechsher
mitzvah</i>, a technical preparation necessary for the fulfillment of a
Mitzvah. If constructing the <i>keilim</i> simply serves as a means to an end,
perhaps the Torah would not be quite as insistent on the order in which it is
performed.</p>

<P>
A similar model can be gleaned from the <i>mitzvah</i> of donning
the priestly vestments. The Rambam (<i>Sefer HaMitzvos</i> ibid) reckons the
act of donning the vestments as an independent <i>mitzvah</i>. In analyzing the
Rambam's opinion, the <i>Minchas Chinuch</i> (n.99) posits that although
there is a <i>mitzvah</i> to dress in the garments, there is perhaps no <i>mitzvah</i>
to don the garments in any particular order (aside from the pants, which the
Torah stipulates must be donned first). However, perhaps one could question the
conclusion of the <i>Minchas Chinuch</i>. If donning the garments served merely
as a preparatory step to facilitate the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>avodah</i>, then
one could certainly envision that the order could be insignificant. As long as
all of the garments are eventually donned, the stated purpose has been
achieved, regardless of their order. If, however, the act of donning
constitutes an independent <i>mitzvah</i>, perhaps one would be required to
follow a specific protocol of <i>halachos</i> regarding the order of the
garments, as is the case with all <i>mitzvos</i>.</p>

<P>The <i>Rashbatz</i> interprets the <i>Mishnah</i> "<i>Im
Ain Ani Li Mi Li</i> - if I am not for myself who will be for me", (<i>Avos</i>
1:14) as teaching that each person must earn merit for himself, and not be
overly reliant on others, as it says in the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Yevamos</i>
109b), a teacher whose students act laudably based on his teaching is not
rewarded unless he himself acts. Similarly, the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Sotah</i>
21a) relates the case of Hillel, who was occupied with Torah, and his brother <i>Shevna</i>,
who was occupied with business. When Shevna suggested that they divide and
share in each other's benefits, a Heavenly voice went out, quoting the <i>possuk</i>
in <i>Shir Hashirim</i> (8:7), "<i>im yiten ish es kol hone beiso b'ahava,
boz yavozu lo - </i>If a man give all the treasure of his house for love, he
would be scorned", meaning, just as money can't buy love, it
can't buy the merit accrued by learning Torah. But if he had proposed
such an arrangement at the outset of Hillel's learning - as had Azariah
to his brother Shimon, and the <i>Nasi</i> to R' Yochanan - there is no
deed greater than that, and he would have shared equally in Hillel's
reward. Likewise, the Rama (<i>Yoreh Deah</i> 246:1) cites this case and says
that a person may make such a stipulation with his friend, provided that his
friend had not already started his learning career.</p>



<P>In a related vein, someone once asked the <i>Maharam Alshakar</i>
(n.101) what he thought of arrangements people made to sell their merits to
each other. He answered by citing Rav Hai Gaon's response to a similar
query, that such behavior was absurd. How could one hope to receive the reward
for another's good deeds? Just as a man cannot become responsible for his
fellow's sins, he cannot acquire the reward for his <i>mitzvos</i>. Certainly,
one who enables others to do <i>mitzvos</i>, to learn or to teach others, will
be rewarded on his own. But that is a far cry from bringing cash to the
marketplace to try and purchase the rewards for other people's <i>mitzvos</i>.
Such rewards are not commodities to be traded or liquid assets to be disposed
of, and one who tries to purchase them will properly be scorned, as was Shevna.
But such sharing arrangements as between Shimon and Azariah and between R'
Yochanan and the <i>Nasi</i> are indeed legitimate. </p>



<P>The <i>Beis Yosef</i> (<i>Teshuvos Avkas Rochel</i>, n. 2)
outlines the contours of such legitimate arrangements. The stipulation must be
made at the beginning of the venture, and only with someone who doesn't earn
enough to support himself and would have otherwise been forced to abandon his
learning completely and go to work. A person so situated is permitted to give
half of the reward for his learning to his friend, and to receive half of his
friend's profits. He then becomes like someone who learns half the day
and works half the day (as does his supporter). However, if the learner does already
earn enough for his needs, he may not make such an arrangement, and one who
does is considered as scorning the word of <i>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</i> (see <i>Igros
Moshe</i>, <i>Yoreh Deah</i>, 4:37). </p>



<P>Likewise, when Yaakov blessed Yissachar, he said (<i>Bereishis</i>
49:15) "<i>vayehi l'mas oved </i>- and he became an indentured
worker". The <i>Meshech Chochmah</i> explains that this refers to the
"tax" Yissachar gives to Zevulun from his labor in Torah [for the financial
support that Zevulun provides Yisachar], as expounded by <i>Chazal</i> on the
verse (<i>Devorim</i> 33:18), "<i>semach Zevulun b'tzeitzecha v'Yissachar
b'ohalecha</i> - rejoice Zevulun in your goings out, and Yissachar in
your tents."</p>



<P>R' Pinchas HaLevi Horowitz (<i>Hafla'ah</i> on <i>Kesuvos</i>,
n. 43), however, holds that the agreement between Yissachar and Zevulun was not
an actual partnership, and that Yissachar's reward was not diminished at
all because of Zevulun's support. Moreover, no <i>talmid chacham</i> will
ever lose any of his spiritual reward via such an arrangement. Though arrogant
people may think they can buy part of a scholar's reward for his Torah
just as they might transact any other business, they are entirely mistaken. It
is unthinkable to R' Horowitz that<i> </i>spiritual reward for learning
is transferable. Rather, Zevulun and all others who support Torah scholars receive
their own reward from Hashem for enabling Torah study, without reducing at all
the reward of the scholars. Just as a flame may kindle other flames without
being reduced itself, so too the reward of Torah study may benefit multiple
people, without diminishing the reward of the individual who actually learns.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The first phase of the exodus from Egypt is
excitingly described in <i>parshas Bo</i>. In <i>Va'eschanan</i> (4:34), the
Torah characterizes the exodus as "has any god ever miraculously come to
take for himself a nation from amidst a nation" (<i>goy mi'kerev
goy</i>). The Yalkut vividly compares the above to the birthing process. Just
as the fetus / embryo is so attached to the mother, literally nourished and
sustained there from, so too were the Jewish people assimilated and
acculturated in Egypt. As the Egyptians were
uncircumcised and groomed there hair in 'bluris style', so did the
vast majority of Jews. The above analogy is further understood that just as the
birth process is exceedingly dangerous, that if the midwife or farmer were to
initiate the process and attempt to extricate the baby from its mother too
soon, it could be fatal for both, and only after some initial movement and
activity on the part of the fetus does it signal the commencement of the
process. So too in Egypt, the exodus spearheaded by G-d
could only begin with the nationalistic stirrings of the Jewish nation,
initiating the birth and creation of their nation.</p>

<P>In light of the above we can appreciate some of the details
of law that were applicable only in Egypt
accompanying the first <i>Pesach seder</i>. The Torah commands that the Pascal
lamb be slaughtered and roasted on the fourteenth of the first month, the day
prior to their exodus. They were to slaughter the god of Egypt,
thereby actively renouncing and showing the powerlessness of the Egyptian
divine. What is most perplexing, however, is why were they mandated to smear
the blood of the lamb on their doorposts and lintel (12:7)? The <i>B'ear Yosef</i>
suggests the following: given that the lamb was roasted (12:8) the aroma wafted
in the homes of the Egyptians as well. Lest an Egyptian invite himself into the
Jewish home for some of the barbecue, the blood of his god on the door was a
horrific degradation, causing him to do an immediate about face.</p>

<P>The birth pangs of Egypt were
the specific actions that the Jewish nation underwent that evening, celebrating
their anticipated freedom. It is these Jewish stirrings from amidst the culture
of Egypt that alerted Hashem as to their readiness for deliverance.</p>

<P>The Torah further commands, (12:22)
"no man shall leave the entrance of his house till morning". The
Torah does not give a reason for this prohibition. The <i>Meshech Chachma</i>
provides a most insightful understanding to the above. The Ramban explains that
the description of Yaakov's struggle - (<i>Breishis</i> 32:25) "Yaakov
was left alone and a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn" - portends
the struggle between the forces of Esav and Yaakov till the end of time.
Similarly, the <i>Meshech Chachma</i> understands this verse as the formula for
survival of the Jewish people in <i>galus</i>, in the diaspora. One is not to
leave the safeguards of the Jewish home till 'morning', till the
final redemption arrives. His thesis is that certain <i>mitzvos</i> play a more
pivotal and paramount role than others, especially in <i>galus</i>. The <i>seyagim</i>
- those <i>mitzvos</i> that were instituted to protect and safeguard the Jewish
home - are crucial for the survival of our people. Thus, the Talmud (<i>Shabbos</i>
17b) lists the 18 enactments that the Ravs instituted including <i>bishul akum</i>-
the prohibition of a non-Jew cooking for a Jew even if the food is kosher. This
law, still in effect today, was instituted to prevent socialization between Jew
and non-Jew. A non-Jew cannot prepare a meal for the Jew without their
participation in the cooking process. The Talmud (<i>Avodah Zorah</i> 42b) states
that included in this <i>seyag</i> is the prohibition of <i>stam ya-nam</i>,
i.e. the prohibition of a non-Jew handling kosher wine (unless pasteurized),
again to thwart socialization and assimilation.</p>

<P>The <i>Meshech Chachma</i> notes, that historically at the
time of the Egyptian exodus, we did not- yet have the Jewish laws, but had the
nationalistic actions that warranted Divine approval in the form of magnificent
miracles that were performed on our behalf. In sharp contrast, at the time of
our exodus from Babylon, we were observant of Jewish
laws, but negligent in the safeguards of our identity, as found in Nechemia (13:23-24).
The Jewish youth spoke <i>Ashdodis</i>, they assumed non-Jewish names, and
intermarried. The <i>Meshech Chachma</i> understands the Talmud (<i>Sotah</i> 36a)
to say that we were denied a second miraculous deliverance because of the sins,
namely because of our acculturation and lack of proper insulations. In the <i>galus</i>
the Jew must strengthen his resolve and commitment especially to the <i>siyagim</i>,
i.e. to those laws that assure and insure our uniqueness and individuality
amongst the nations.</p>

<P>This teaching is so essential today. In yesteryear, the Jew
living amongst the nations had to be on guard from <u>actively</u> going and
visiting their forums of entertainment. Such a visit required, however, a
deliberate and conscious effort on his part; he had to seek out this foreign
set of values and morality. Today, with the internet and Blackberry almost
appended to one's body, it is most difficult and challenging to avoid
surfing in foreign and forbidden sites. Moreover, one mistaken inadvertent
click can catapult a person "out of his home" and environment.</p>

<P>"No man shall leave the entrance of his house until
the morning" is understood by Rav Hirsch <i>zt"l</i> to prevent the
mob mentality from influencing the fledgling Jewish nation to retaliate against
its former masters. In addition, the <i>pasuk</i> teaches us how we are to
learn from the past and realize that our homes are to be fortified with Torah,
Jewish values, Jewish music, love and concern, thereby preparing us for the
dawn of our ultimate deliverance. Now more than ever, the teaching of <i>Anshei
Knesses Hagedolah</i>, (<i>Avos</i> 1:1) "<i>asu seyag la-torah</i> - make
a fence for the Torah" is crucial for our survival.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>According to the <i>Sefer haChinuch</i>, ten of the eighteen
<i>mitzvos</i> found in <i>Parshas Naso</i> deal with the <i>nazir</i>. As
such, it is understandable that the <i>haftorah</i> chosen for this <i>parsha</i>
would focus on the laws of <i>nazir</i> as found in the book of <i>Shoftim</i>.
We are taught that an angel of Hashem appears to the wife of Manoach and
informs her that she will conceive and give birth to a son. The prophecy
continues, and she is told that this son is to be (<i>Shoftim</i> 13:5), "a
Nazarite of G-D from the womb", till the day of his death.</p>

<P>When she relates the prophecy to her husband he prays to Hashem
that the angel should reappear and "teach us what we should do to the
child who will be born" (13:8). At first glance this is most challenging
- what didn't Manoach understand that he needed clarification from the
angel? The laws of the <i>nazir</i> are stated explicitly in <i>Parshas Naso</i>
and there were no lack of Ravs and teachers who could guide him with any
questions.</p>

<P>Moreover, when Hashem accedes to his request and the angel
reappears, he repeats to Manoach the same set of instructions as before. What
has been accomplished with the second visit of the angel? Rav Schwab zt"l,
in his <i>Mayan Beis Ha-Shoeva</i>, introduces a novel and insightful message
in the form of additional component to the prophecy. The <i>malach</i> tells
the father-to-be, (13:13-14), "whatever I have told your wife <i><u>tishmor</u></i>
- you shall observe." On the surface he is simply restating the rules.
However, this may be understood to mean that the <i>malach</i> told Manoach<i> </i>that
he himself shall also observe what he had told his wife, namely the laws of the
<i>nazir.</i></p>

<P>What was troubling Manoach, and what caused him to talk to
the angel directly, was not that he did not trust his wife's account of
the initial prophecy. Rather, Manoach was troubled by a father who is not a <i>nazir</i>
himself raising a child to be a <i>nazir</i>. The angel affirmed his concern, and
agreed that the only way to raise a <i>nazir</i> is for the father as well to
practice and observe the laws of <i>nezirus</i>. If Manoach would drink wine
and cut his own hair, his effectiveness as a mentor would be severely
compromised. Thus, the preamble to the birth of Shimshon contains a most
valuable pedagogical lesson: "Do as I say not as I do" is not
effective parenting.</p>

<P>This positive lesson is gleaned by the Chasam Sofer in his
understanding of the verse, (<i>Shemos</i> 12:24), regarding the laws of <i>Peasach</i>,
"you shall observe this matter as a decree for yourself and for your
children forever." He notes that only when the example has been set by
the parent, can there be expectation for continuity by children.</p>

<P>Indeed, the same lesson can be derived from the familiar
passage of <i>v'shomru</i> (<i>Shemos</i> 31:16), "the children of
Israel shall observe the Shabbos, to make the Shabbos an eternal covenant for their
generations." If Shabbos is positive and spiritually uplifting in
addition to restful and socially engaging, the reverence and respect for
Shabbos by one's children will hopefully follow. Rav Moshe Feinstein <i>zt"l</i>
noted that the generation that sacrificed for Shabbos, often losing their jobs
to keep Shabbos, but complained at the Shabbos table "<i>vi shver tzu
zein a yid</i>" it is difficult to be a Jew"could not transmit a
Shabbos to their children that would be everlasting. Their children, while
proud of their parents, were not prepared to make that sacrifice. When Shabbos
is observed with pleasantness and sweetness, there is greater likelihood for
perpetuity.</p>

<P>The first <i>beracha</i> of <i>Birkas Hatorah</i> recited daily
speaks of the sweetness of Torah and asks Hashem for His assistance in
experiencing and imbibing this sweetness. What follows next is the prayer that
our children and children's children will be immersed and accomplished in
the study of Torah. The <i>beracha</i> itself provides the best method of
insurance: if you show your children by your studying Torah with excitement and
enthusiasm for Torah, there is a much greater chance they will wish to emulate
your ways.</p>

<P>Good Jewish parenting begins with the father of our people,
Avraham <i>Avinu</i>. We are told that Hashem loved him (<i>Bereishis</i> 18:19),
"because he commands his children and his household after him - <i>achaRav</i>
that they keep the way of Hashem, doing charity and justice." "<i>AchaRav</i>"
denotes that Avraham taught by example and hence his lessons live on.</p>

		<date><![CDATA[2012]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vaeschanan]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P><i>Parshas Va'eschanan</i> enlightens us with a dozen <i>mitzvos</i>.
We are met with the <i>Aseres Hadibros</i> (Ten Commandments), the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>Shema Yisrael</i>, <i>yichud Hashem</i> (the oneness of G-D), the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>talmud Torah</i>, the <i>mitzvahs</i> of <i>tefillin</i>, the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>mezuzah</i>, the prohibition of intermarriage, etc. What a special <i>parsha</i>!
The <i>parsha</i> itself, I believe, consoles the Jewish People.</p>

<P>Let us consider the first paragraph of the <i>Shema</i> (<i>Devarim</i>
6:4-9). The verse begins, "<i>ve'shinantam l'banecha</i>,"
and you are to teach them to your children. The Talmud teaches that in this
verse "<i>banecha</i>," literally your children, refers to "<i>talmidecha
-</i> your students." The effective teacher is the one who looks at his
students as if they are his children. There is an incredible love that a father
and mother have for their children, and that is the love that a teacher has to
have for his students.</p>

<P>The very next verse is, "<i>U'kshartam
l'os al yadecha ve'hayu le'totafos bein einecha -</i> and you
are to bind them for a sign on your hand and they are to be a remembrance
between your eyes", a reference to <i>tefillin</i>. Thus, in the first
paragraph of the <i>Shema</i> the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>talmud Torah</i>
precedes the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>tefillin</i>.</p>

<P>Interestingly, in the second paragraph of the <i>Shema</i>
these two <i>mitzvos</i> appear in the exact opposite order. First the Torah
states (ibid. 11:18), "<i>u'kshartem osam le'os al yedchem - </i>and
you are to bind them for a sign on your hand", i.e. you are to first put
on tefillin, and then the very next verse proclaims, "<i>ve'leemad'tem
osam es bneichem - </i>and you are to teach them to your children",
referring to yhe teaching of one's biological children. Why is it that in
the first paragraph, when discussing the teacher-student relationship, the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>talmud Torah</i> precedes that of <i>tefillin</i> whereas in the second
paragraph when we are talking about the obligation of a parent to his own
children, the order of these two <i>mitzvos</i> is reversed?</p>

<P>The teacher has to teach - that is his profession. He
prepares lesson plans in advance on a variety of topics, including the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>tefillin</i>, and the instruction precedes action. A parent also has to
teach, however a parent teaches, first and foremost, by example. The parent is
the role model for his child. Therefore, a parent teaches about <i>tefillin</i>
by making sure the child sees his father putting on<i> tefillin</i>.</p>

<P>A certain gentleman who <i>davened</i> in the same <i>beis
medrash</i> as the late Rav Moshe Feinstein <i>zt"l </i>would bring his
child to the <i>beis medrash</i> and would spend a lot of time <i>shushing</i>
the child to make sure that he behaved properly. Rav Moshe asked the man,
"What are you doing?" The man responded, "I am teaching him
how to <i>daven</i>." Rav Moshe replied, "Don't shush, JUST
DAVEN, and he will learn to <i>daven</i> from you."</p>

<P>There is a delicious teaching brought down in <i>Maseches
Kallah</i> (3) that when Aharon <i>haKohen</i> died, no less than eighty
thousand children named Aharon walked after his coffin. The reason behind this
interesting behavior is that there were many among <i>am Yisrael </i>who wanted
to get divorced. It was Aharon who caused them to change their minds.
Accordingly, there were eighty thousand young men named Aharon. Are we meant to
imagine that Aharon <i>haKohen</i> met with each one of their parents? Of
course not! Rather, it comes to demonstrate for us that Aharon's very
nature influenced people; he was a role model. Everyone should have one, and
everyone should be one.</p>

<P><i>Tu B'Av</i> generally falls during the week
following <i>parshas Va'eschanan</i>. The last <i>mishna</i> in <i>Maseches
Taanis</i> teaches that <i>Yom Kippur</i> and <i>Tu B'Av</i> were among
the happiest days in the Jewish year. This is understandably said about <i>Yom
Kippur</i>, the day on which we received the second set of <i>luchot</i>
(tablets), which showed us that <i>Hashem</i> had forgiven us for the sin of
the Golden Calf. However, what is it about <i>Tu B'Av</i> that is so
special? The <i>gemara</i> <i>(Ta'anis</i> 30b) lists many special things which
occurred on <i>Tu B'Av</i>. Let us focus on one of those events.</p>

<P>When Shlomo <i>Hamelech</i> died, his son Rechavam assumed
the kingship. Shlomo was a most popular king due to his tremendous wisdom and
incredible international relations. As such, while he taxed the people heavily,
they accepted it from him. After he died, his son Rechavam had to decide if he
would listen to his father's elder advisors and lower taxes, or listen to
his younger advisors and tax them more heavily. He made the wrong decision and
listened to his younger advisors, which ultimately resulted in the secession of
ten of the tribes as well as the elevation of YeRavam <i>ben</i> Nevat, a
righteous individual at the time, to the position of king over those tribes (<i>Melachim</i>
I 12).</p>

<P>YeRavam changed while on the throne, and thought, "If
I allow the Jewish People in my jurisdiction to go three times a year (<i>Pesach</i>,
<i>Shavuos</i>, and <i>Sukkos</i>) to the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, they will
leave me and go to Rechavam." In order to maximize control over his
kingdom, he placed roadblocks and forbade the Jewish people in his constituency
from going up to <i>Yerushalayim</i> for the three pilgrimage festivals.
Instead, he positioned two golden calves, one in the north in <i>Dan</i> and
another in the south in Bet El, thereby providing his constituents with the
opportunity to worship closer to home.</p>

<P>Years later, Hoshea <i>ben</i> Ela, a king of Israel,
removed these roadblocks. However, he did not tell people to go up to <i>Yerushalayim
</i>and instead let them choose between it and the idolatry in the north. He is
therefore considered a wicked king (see <i>Rashi </i>on <i>Taanis</i> 31a).
Despite the fact that he certainly improved upon the situation left to him,
that does not suffice for a role model such as a king of Israel. A true role
model is supposed to lead the people, show them, teach them, and take the
initiative. They would have followed him. As such, Hoshea <i>ben</i> Ela
failed.</p>

<P>This is an important lesson for all of us. The <i>gemara</i>
in <i>Maseches Brachos</i> summarizes this message saying, "<i>gadol
shimusho yoser mi'limudo"</i> - not only is it significant to study
Torah from a qualified teacher, but it is even more significant to spend
personal time with such a teacher in order to observe how he acts and learn
from his behavior. Please God, his behavior should rub off on you and uplift
your way of life as well.</p>

<P>May this <i>Shabbos Nachamu</i> be a meaningful one for us
all, first and foremost in fulfilling the command of <i>ve'shinantam
l'banecha</i> together with <i>ve'limad'tem osam es bneichem</i>,
being ideal role models for our children who act in a way which is worthy of
duplicating. In addition, even as adults, may our eyes be open, always looking
always for that person whom we are to follow, and may
we have the resolve to emulate that person.</p>

		<date><![CDATA[2012]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vayetze]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The <i>Tzlach</i> cites a popular expression focusing on the
significance of time which says, "The past is gone (<i>aiyen</i>) the
future is not-yet here (<i>adayin</i>) and the present is like the blink of an
eye (<i>k'heref aiyen</i>)".</p>

<P>While this is true most of the time for most people, it does
not apply to the Jewish nation. Case in point: while it is understood that the
past might affect the future, we have as an integral part of our <i>mesorah</i>
(tradition), that the future affects the present and past, as I will demonstrate.</p>

<P>That our rich past positivity influences our future can be
seen by the selfless actions of Rachel <i>Imeinu</i>. The Talmud (<i>Yevamos</i>
64A) teaches that our matriarchs were barren because Hashem desired their
prayers. Deep heartfelt prayers create a stronger bond and connection between
the petitioner and the Divine. Thus, when Rachel is granted a child, we are
told (30:22) "G-d remembered Rachel, He hearkened to her and He opened her
womb". The words "G-d remembered" are understand by <i>Chazal</i>
(<i>Bava Basra</i> 123A) to indicate that Hashem remembered her giving the
secret signs shared between her and Yaakov to her sister Leah on the night she
was to marry Yaakov in order to spare her sister great humiliation. This
incredible act of self- sacrifice, not knowing at the time that she would marry
Yaakov a week later, was not only beneficial in her having children, but we are
taught in the introduction to <i>Eicha</i> (24) and in Kina (26) of <i>Tisha
Ba'av</i>, that the prophet Yirmiyahu awakens the patriarchs and matriarchs to
arouse Hashem's mercy to allow the Jewish nation to return to their land and
relationship to Hashem. However, none of the Avos are successful until Rachel <i>Imeinu</i>
entreats, "I allowed a <i>tzarah</i> (rival) to come into my house (my
sister) therefore Hashem you forgive them for bringing the <i>tzarah</i> of idolatry
into your home."</p>

<P>The <i>haftorah</i> we read annually on <i>Rosh Hashana</i>
from <i>Yirmiyahu</i> cites the magnanimity of Rachel (31:15) "So said
Hashem: restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears; for there is
a reward for your accomplishment - the words of Hashem - and they shall return
from the enemies' land". The "accomplishment" is understood by
Rashi to be her sharing the signs with her sister. The future redemption of <i>Klal
Yisroel</i> is anchored in her rich meritorious past.</p>

<P>In addition, the <i>medrash</i> at the beginning of <i>Chayei</i>
Sarah(<i>Berashis Raba</i> 58:3) teaches that Rav Akiva was sitting and
teaching and the people were dozing; in order to arouse them he shared the
following: "Why was Queen Esther privileged to rule over 127 provinces,
because her great-grandmother Sarah lived for 127 years". This was more
than a pedagogic tactic. The nation at the time of Roman persecution was giving
up hope and faith. In order to ignite their spirits Rav Akiva told them that
they possess in their arsenal an invaluable commodity, perhaps bigger and
greater than themselves, namely the merit of their ancestors. Thus the deposit
that Sarah made through her noble life in the Divine Bank of Israel accrued
dividends for her offspring for many generations to come. The past unties with
the future.</p>

<P>The Jewish nation is unique in that the future as well effects
and influences the present/past. The <i>medrash</i> (Ibid 63 :2) on the
opening verse of <i>parshas Toldos</i> teaches based upon <i>Yeshiyah</i>
(29:22) that Jacob redeemed Avraham. The <i>medrash</i> understands this to
mean that Avraham <i>Avinu</i> was miraculously spared the inferno of <i>Ur
Kasdim</i> in the merit of his grandson Yaakov. (The Sfas Emes understands that
since Avraham was not yet circumcised when he was thrown into the furnace, he
did not yet have enough of his own merit to survive.) Moreover, the <i>medrash</i>
in <i>parshas Noach</i> on the challenging verse (8:21) that follows Noach's bringing
offerings after the flood states that, "Hashem smelled the pleasing aroma,
and Hashem said in His heart: 'I will not continue to curse again the
ground because of man, since the imagery of man's heart is evil from his youth
nor will I again continue to smite every living being, as I have done'".
What does it mean that He smelled - Hashem is incorporeal!? The <i>medrash</i> (ibid
34:9) understands this to mean that He saw the heroism and self-sacrifice of Chananya,
Mishael, and Azaria being thrown by Nebuchadnezzar into the furnace. The future
sterling charterer of these righteous, courageous, young men was beneficial to
prior generations.</p>

<P>Chanukah is rapidly approaching. The second blessing we
recite prior to lighting the menorah is that He performed miracles for our
ancestors in those days at this time. The last phrase, at this time, is usually
understood to pinpoint the time of the year. However, in keeping with our
theme, it can also be understood to mean He performed miracles for our
ancestors that they might not have been worthy of, but Hashem looked to the
future (<i>bazman ha'zeh</i> - at this time) and in our merit, and that
of subsequent generations, He performed miracles for them.</p>

<P>The exciting lesson derived from above is that every <i>chayal</i>
(Israeli soldier) is accompanied by 3,000 years of Jewish history and a
glorious future of Torah and <i>mitzvos</i> to protect him. In addition, Hashem
gave the land of Israel to the Jewish nation on condition we are faithful to
His laws (<i>Tehillim</i> 105:44-45). Our personal rededication to Torah and <i>mitzvos</i>
is another real way we can help our solders.</p>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Benjamin Yudin]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2013]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: pesach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The Torah (<i>Devarim</i> 15:3) refers to <i>matzah</i> as "<i>lechem
oni</i>". The second word, which we pronounce as "<u>o</u><i>ni</i>
- answering", is written in the Torah "<i><u>a</u>ni</i> - poor".
When interpreted using the written form of the word (i.e. the <i>ksiv</i> - "<i>ani"</i>)
the phrase means poor man's bread. Shmuel (<i>Pesachim</i> 36a) understands the
pronounced version of the word (i.e. the <i>kri</i> - "<i>oni"</i>)
to be the source that we are to recite many recitations over, and in
conjunction with, the <i>matzah</i>. The Talmud further understands "<i>lechem
<u>a</u>ni</i> - poor man's bread" to prescribe the meager ingredient
list of flour and water and to exclude <i>matzah</i> made with wine or oil as
well as what we call today egg <i>matzah</i>. In addition, we are taught that
just as when an impoverished individual receives a loaf of bread he saves a
half for the future, so too the <i>matzah</i> is characterized by it being a <i>prusa</i>
- a broken half.</p>

<P>We integrate both themes - <i>oni</i> and <i>ani</i> - at
the <i>Pesach Seder</i>. We begin the recitation of <i>magid</i> with "<i>Ha
lachma anya</i>", thus highlighting <i>matzah</i>'s role as the
bread of affliction over which we are going to recite (<i>oni</i>) the <i>Hagadah</i>
(specifically, <i>magid</i> and the first two paragraphs of <i>Hallel</i>). Immediately
prior to <i>magid</i> we break the middle <i>matzah</i> at <i>yachatz</i> just as
a poor man would save part of his loaf of bread in order to present the <i>matzah</i>
in its true form following the <i>ksiv</i> - ani. We further integrate the kri
and ksiv by proclaiming that the <i>matzah</i> is the bread of the poor, and we
invite the poor to join us in our celebration.</p>

<P>The <i>mishna</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 116b) teaches that in
every generation we are to view ourselves as if we personally left Egypt. Rav
Yosef Salant <i>zt"l</i> suggests (in <i>Be'er Yosef</i>) that by
proclaiming that this is the bread of the poor we relive the evening of the
Exodus, reminding ourselves that our ancestors were slaves and poor and ate <i>matzah</i>
for centuries prior to the Exodus, helping us focus on that frame of mind, and
allowing us to feel as if we personally left Egypt. It is thus understandable
that the declaration, "<i>ha lachma anya di achalu avhasana b'ar'ah
d'Mitzrayim</i> - this <i>matzah</i> that our ancestors ate in the land
of Egypt" has two connotations. The first connotation is that we ate <i>matzah</i>
as slaves, and the second is that we ate <i>matzah</i> on the way out of Egypt.
It speaks of our servitude and our freedom. Perhaps, then, another reason for
splitting the <i>matzah</i> at <i>yachatz</i> is to call attention to the dual
theme of <i>matzah</i> and note that the larger half is for the <i>afikomen</i>,
the sign of our freedom and deliverance.</p>

<P>The Bear Yosef additionally notes that while there is the <i>mitzvah</i>
to invite the poor and needy and those who are alone to all <i>yom tov</i>
meals (as the Rambam emphasizes in Hilchos Yom Tov 6:18), the special <i>mitzvah</i>
on the night of <i>Pesach</i> to have the needy at your table is a further
fulfillment of demonstrating that you personally left Egypt in that very state.
It is the actual reliving of the moment. Hence, the inclusion of "<i>kol
dichfin yeisei v'yeichol</i>- let all who are hungry and needy join us."</p>

<P>There is one more fascinating connection between the <i>ksiv</i>
of <i>ani</i> and <i>kri</i> of <i>oni</i>. The Torah informs us that the
Jewish people demonstrated incredible faith by leaving Egypt without
provisions. True, we are taught that the Egyptians gave the former slaves
silver and gold vessels and garments, however they did not have food except for
the <i>matzah</i> they took with them. Rashi (<i>Beshalach</i> 16:1) teaches
that miraculously that <i>matzah</i> lasted and sustained them for thirty one
days and sixty one meals! By proclaiming and pointing to the <i>matzah</i>, the
poor's man bread, we are encouraging the poor that just as He provided for all
of us who were needy at that time, may He similarly provide for those still impoverished.</p>

<P><i>Ha lachma anya</i> thus bespeaks of our historical past, our faith and our optimism.</p>

<P>Our nationhood and redemption started with <i>emunah</i> - faith,
it progressed with faith and is perpetuated by faith. When Moshe acquiesced and
accepted the mantle of leadership to be the spokesman of Hashem to His enslaved
nation, the Torah (<i>Shemos</i> 4:31) informs us that the people believed
Moshe, that he was the messenger to lead their emancipation. The <i>Medrash</i>
(<i>Shemos Rabbah</i> 5:13) comments on this verse that it was not the signs
and wonders that Moshe performed that won them over, rather the faith that the
one who brought the message of "<i>pakod yifkod - </i>Hashem will redeem
you" is the true representative of Hashem.</p>



<P>Regarding the Jews at <i>Yam Suf</i> we are told, "and
they had faith in Hashem and in Moshe, His servant" (<i>Shemos</i> 14:31.)
Finally, at Sinai "Hashem said to Moshe, Behold! I come to you in the thickness
of the cloud, so that the people will hear as I speak to you, and they will
believe in you forever"(<i>Shemos</i> 19:9.) Thus, the revelation at Sinai
was predicated on faith and maintains that faith. </p>



<P>The Talmud (Shabbos 88B) relates the Rava was questioned,
how could the Jewish nation at Sinai not question Hashem as to the content of
His Torah prior to accepting it? Unlike all other nations that asked, "What
is written in it?", "What are its laws?", "Let us see
if we can comply with it?" (<i>Sifrei</i> 343), the Jewish nation responded
"<i>Naaseh v'nishmah</i> - we will do and we will obey" (<i>Shemos</i>
24:7.) Rava answered by citing the verse from Proverbs (11:3), "<i>tumas
yesharim tancheim</i> - the perfect faith of the upright shall lead them".
Rashi understands this to mean we trusted Hashem out of love, and relied on Him
that He would not burden us with something we could not do. <i>Kabolas haTorah</i>
was based on the pure faith of our ancestors, that not only could we observe
and follow His Torah but that this is the best possible life for us. </p>



<P>The Talmud (<i>Nidah</i> 70b) asks what should a person do
to become rich? Rebe Yehoshua answered that (1) he should invest time in his
business, (2) he should conduct his business affairs with integrity and (3) he
should pray to Hashem, the source of all wealth. The above is understandable,
as the Kli Yakor (<i>Vayikra</i> 25:36) explains the prohibition of charging
interest to a Jew is based upon the reality that for all business transactions
one needs Divine assistance. Will they be successful, will they and their
merchandise find favor in the eyes of the next one? Willy-nilly, the merchant
looks heavenward, prays for success in his endeavors. Not so the one who lends
on interest, he has taken care of matters himself. He is ensured of his success
and profit by stipulating in advance the interest he will take. Such an
individual has removed Hashem from the equation. The Torah therefore prohibits
lending with interest, to bolster and maintain the faith of the businessman. </p>



<P>What is fascinating however, is the earlier question posed
in the above <i>gemara</i>. What should a person do to become a scholar? Rebe
Yehosua answered that he should spend more time studying in the Yeshiva, spend
less time in business, and pray to Hashem for wisdom, as He is the source of
all wisdom. Regarding wealth it is understandable that one is to pray, as this
reinforces the faith and recognition that ultimately it all comes from On High.
What role does prayer play with Torah knowledge? </p>



<P>Every morning we are privileged to recite two blessings
prior to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>. The first speaks of Hashem as the
Creator, and His daily renewal of nature. In the second blessing we thank Him
for the gift of Torah. In fact, if one is late in coming to Synagogue and did
not yet recite <i>birkas haTorah</i>, the daily blessings in honor of a Torah,
one can satisfy their obligation with this second <i>beracha</i> of <i>Ahava
Rabbah</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim</i> 46.) Note, in it we not only ask
Hashem for Divine assistance "to instill in our hearts the desire to understand
and discern, to listen learn and teach, to observe perform and fulfill all the
teachings of Your Torah in love". We also ask Hashem in the merit of our ancestors
who trusted in You and to whom You taught the laws of life, be gracious also to
us and teach us). As the original <i>kabolas haTorah</i> was predicated on <i>emunah</i>,
so too our personal and communal <i>kabolas haTorah</i> is only meaningful if
it is coupled with faith. Specifically, we have faith that the Torah speaks to
our generation and provides meaning and purpose for life as it did for the
generation at Sinai and to all subsequent generation. We Pray to Him daily that
we remain steadfast in our faith.</p>



<P>Perhaps this is why we most always read <i>Parshas Bamidbar</i>
on the Shabbos prior to Shavuos. While there are no specific <i>mitzvos</i> found
in this <i>parsha</i>, the setting of the desert, and as our Ravs (<i>Mechilta</i>)
inform us "The Torah was only given to those who ate and were nourished by
the <i>mun</i> - the daily ration of manna that descended from heaven".
Hashem, who could have provided them with their gift of <i>mun</i> annually, chose
to do so daily to bolster their emunah. We, their proud descents, are the
beneficiaries of their basic training in <i>emunah</i>, enabling us to take Hashem's
Torah and "transform wastelands into Eden" (Yeshaya 51:3.)</p>

		<date><![CDATA[2013]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: bo]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Two of the four <i>parshios</i> contained in the <i>tefillin</i>
are found at the conclusion of <i>parshas Bo</i>. Many of the laws of <i>tefillin</i>
are <i>halacha l'Moshe miSinai</i>, (i.e. taught to Moshe by Hashem during his
tenure atop Mount Sinai.) Among these laws is the requirement for <i>tefillin</i>
to be black square boxes containing four paragraphs from the Torah that
reference the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>tefillin</i>. Another law requires that
the <i>tefillin</i> worn on one's arm has one compartment that contains
the four paragraphs on one long piece of parchment, while the <i>tefillin</i> worn
on one's head has four compartments, each housing a separate paragraph.</p>

<P>The Torah does not give a reason for the aforementioned difference
between the two <i>tefillin</i>. The Meshech Chachma (13:9) suggests an
interesting approach. Regarding the <i>Bais Hamikdash</i>, Shlomo <i>Hamelech</i>
speaks for Hashem (<i>Melachim</i> 1, 9:3) and declares, "My eyes and My
heart shall be there all the days". The Meshech Chachma takes the liberty
of extending this relationship of Hashem directed to the <i>Bais Hamikdash</i>,
to the connection of man to Hashem when he dons his <i>tefillin</i> (see Rambam
<i>Hilchos Tefillin</i> 4:24.) The Tefillin of the hand placed across from the
heart corresponds to the love that Hashem has for all Israel. As a parent loves
all their children equally, so does Hashem love all Israel, and hence the four <i>parshios</i>
are included on one <i>klaf</i> (parchment) in <i>tefillin</i> worn on one's
arm. The <i>tefillin</i> on one's head is placed between one's eyes
and hints at Hashem's <i>hashgaca pratis</i> (divine providence), his watching
over us. In this realm there are four compartments, corresponding to the four
types of Jews. The Medrash (<i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 30:12) teaches that the four
species of <i>esrog</i>, <i>lulav</i>, <i>hadassim</i> and <i>aRavos</i>
correspond to those individuals with both Torah and good deeds, those with only
one or the other, and those with neither. Commensurate with one's
accomplishments is His divine providence.</p>

<P>With the above teaching we can now understand and appreciate
the teaching of the <i>gemarah</i> (<i>Menachos</i> 37b) which identifies that
the <i>tefillin</i> on one's head is to be worn on the high part of the
head. The Talmud asks what is the source that the <i>tefillin</i> are to be
donned above one's hairline and opposite the space between one's
eyes? The answer given is a <i>gezara shava</i>, one of the thirteen rules by
which the Torah is expounded. When similar words are used in two independent
laws, there is a Sinaitic tradition that they are meant to shed light one upon
the other. The Torah in <i>parshas Bo</i> (13:16) mandates that <i>tefillin</i>
be "between your eyes", and the Torah teaches (<i>Devarim</i> 14:1)
regarding a mourner "you shall not make a bold spot between your eyes for
the dead". In both places the Torah mentions the space between your eyes;
the <i>gezara shava</i> teaches that just as regarding a mourner it must refer
to the high part of the head, a scalp, as that is the place to potentially make
a bold spot, so too regarding the <i>tefillin</i> the Torah mandates the it be
placed on the high part of the head.</p>

<P>I believe the above cited <i>gemarah</i> is teaching a great
deal more than where to place the <i>tefillin</i>; the Talmud is teaching an
important philosophical lesson of the <i>tefillin</i>. In the very place that
others would rip out their hair in an expression of despair and helplessness
over the death of a loved one, our Holy Torah directs us to place the <i>tefillin</i>,
a symbol of our faith in God, who in His Divine Providence controls and directs
everything. Thus, the <i>tefillin</i> which contain the oneness of G-d as found
in the <i>Shema</i> and the exodus from Egypt bolster the belief and faith of
the Jew, enabling him to accept and appreciate all that Hashem does. The <i>gezara
shava</i> not only explains the where of the Tefillin, but the why as well.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: devarim]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>This Shabbos we begin the fifth book of the Torah, which is
known as "<i>Mishneh Torah</i>". This name is understood to mean the
book of either repetition or review of the Torah. The Talmud (<i>Avodah Zarah</i>
25a), when discussing the miracle of the sun standing still for Yehoshuah, cites
the verse (Yehoshuah 10:13) that this event is recorded in "Sefer
Ha-Yasher - The Book of the Upright." The Talmud brings two opinions as
to what book is being referred to; Rabi Chiyah Bar Abah taught in the name of
Rav Yochanan that this refers to the book of <i>Bereishis</i>, which deals
primarily with the <i>Avos</i> (patriarchs) who are called <i>yesharim</i> (<i>Bamidbar</i>
23:10). Rabi Elazar said that this is a reference to <i>Sefer Devarim</i>, as
it contains the verse "<i>v'asee-sah ha-yasher v'ha-tov b'einei
Hashem</i> - you shall do what is upright and good in the eyes of Hashem (6:18).</p>



<P>Does it make sense that the entire book of <i>Devarim</i> would
be called <i>Sefer Hayashar</i> just because it includes the aforementioned verse?
The Maharsha (<i>ibid</i>) answers that this verse is always associated with
the concept of <i>lifnim me-shuras hadin</i> - going beyond what would be
expected to be the strict law. Implementations of this concept include the law
of <i>shumah hadar</i> (seized property which must be returned to the debtor -
see <i>Bava Metziah</i> 16b) and the law of <i>bar metzrah</i> (the rite of
first refusal <i>ibid</i> 108a). Thus, the Maharsha contends, the <i>mitzvos</i>
contained in the book of <i>Devarim</i> reflect this noble unique concept of
Jewish law, and as such is appropriately called <i>Sefer Hayashar</i>.</p>



<P>Rav Alpert <i>zt"l</i> (<i>Limudai Nissan</i>, volume
2 page 108) gives a few examples of this concept. In <i>Parshas Mishpatim</i>
the Torah clearly warns that one is not to damage another with his body or
property, and must pay for any damage that is done. Here in <i>Devarim</i>, we
are taught that a protective fence must be put around one's roof and
dangerous areas to prevent even accidents from happening (22:8). In <i>Mishpatim</i>
we are taught the obligations that one must provide his wife, namely, food
clothing and marital relations (21:10). In <i>Devarim</i>, we are taught to go
beyond the obligations and to make our wives happy - "<i>v'seemach
es ishto</i>" (24:5).</p>



<P>Interestingly, the <i>Torah Temimah </i>compares "<i>v'asee-sah
ha-yasher v'ha-tov</i>" to "<i>v'ahavtah l'reiacha
kamocha</i>" and states that just as "<i>v'ahavtah</i>..."
is a <i>klal gadol baTorah</i> - a mainstay of the Torah - so is "<i>v'asee-sah
ha-yasher v'ha-tov</i>" a mainstay to the book of <i>Devarim</i>.</p>



<P>I believe it is not by chance that we read <i>Parashas
Devarim</i> annually on the Shabbos before <i>Tisha B'av</i>. Not only is
the verse "<i>Eicha Esah L'vadi</i>" (1:12) read to the sad
tune of the book of <i>Eicha</i>, reminding us of the connection to the
forthcoming fast day, but the primary message of <i>Devarim</i> admonishes the
Jewish people and creates the environment for <i>Tisha B'av</i>.</p>



<P>The Talmud (<i>Bava Metziah</i> 30b) teaches in the name of
Rav Yochanan that Jerusalem was destroyed because they acted in accordance with
the letter of the law of the Torah and did not perform actions that would have
gone beyond the letter of the law. Tosafos asks does not the Talmud (<i>Yuma</i>
9b) ascribe the cause of the destruction of the second <i>Bais HaMikdash</i> to
<i>sinas chinam</i> - baseless hatred? Tosafos answers that both factors caused
the destruction. I understand this to mean, that because of the breakdown of human
relations they understandably did not go <i>lifnim meshuras hadin</i> for one another.
As we acted with din, strict justice devoid of compassion, Hashem acted
accordingly with us, and destroyed the <i>Bais HaMikdash</i>.</p>



<P>This past Monday, was Rosh Chodesh Av, the only Yahrtzeit
mentioned in the Torah, that of Aharon haCohen. I believe it is more than
coincidental that we are reminded on the day that begins our focus on our
glorious past, when we had His Divine Presence in our midst, our long bitter
exile with inquisitions, pogroms and a Holocaust, and our yearning for the
third Temple, that we learn from this great leader in Israel. The Talmud
Sanhedrin (6b) contrasts Moshe and Aharon. The former is described as <i>yikov hadin
es ha-har </i>- strict justice. Aharon loved peace, pursued peace, and made
peace between one man and another as is stated in Malachai (2:6), "he
walked with me <i>b'shalom u'mishor</i> - in peace and uprightness -
and turned many away from sin". Note the similarity between <i>b'shalom
u'mishor</i> and "<i>v'asee-sah ha-yasher v'ha-tov</i>".</p>



<P>Finally, Hashem manifested Himself to His people in a
fashion <i>lifnim meshuras hadin</i> (<i>Avos</i> 5:7). In fact, even at the
time of the actual <i>churban</i>, the <i>keruvim</i> (cherubs atop the Aron -
the holy ark) were embracing (<i>Yuma</i> 54b), showing that even at that
moment He had not tuned His back on, nor forsaken, His children. It behooves us
as we approach another <i>Tisha B'av</i> to introspect regarding many
areas of our lives, especially in our interpersonal relationships, and to see
how in our daily interactions with our spouse, our children, our coworkers, and
our congregants we can go <i>lifnim meshoras hadin</i>, hopefully causing Him to respond
in kind.</p>

<P>Wishing all a meaningful fast.</p>

<P>Rav Yitzchak Zilberstein <i>shlita"h</i>
(<i>V'haarev Nah</i>, vol. 3, p. 450) addresses an interesting sensitive question regarding a group of about 10 men
who study Talmud together. When it comes to a new <i>mesechta</i> - tractate,
they rotate as to who purchases the <i>gemaras</i> for the group. With the
great variety of <i>gemaras</i> available, including those with more features,
the more affluent members purchased more costly texts, and the more
economically strapped purchased more basic texts. The question was: should the <i>magid
shiur</i>, instructor of the group, make a policy that only one type of <i>gemara</i>
should be bought, to protect the dignity of the poorer members?</P>

<P>The <i>mishna (Bikurim</i> 3:8) teaches that poor farmers gave the <i>kohein</i>
both their <i>bikurim</i> fruits and the simple myrtle baskets in which they
brought the <i>bikurim</i>, while the affluent farmers took back their baskets
of gold and silver. Rav Zilberstein, discussing the above issue of <i>gemara</i>
purchases, cites the following question of the Tosfos Yom Tov on this <i>mishna</i>:
just as the <i>mishna</i> (<i>Taanis</i> 26b)
teaches that girls borrowed dresses on <i>Tu B'av</i> and <i>Yom Kippur</i> in
order to not embarrass the poor girls, why not legislate here that everyone should
bring Bikurim in simple baskets? Tosfos Yom Tov answers that the honor of the <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i> and allowing the wealthy farmers to enrich their <i>mitzvah</i>
and beautify it, thus fulfilling <i>ze Keili v'anveihu</i>, overrode the concern
of sensitivity to the poor.</P>

<P>Rav Zilberstein brings an
exciting Malbim (26:4) who teaches that
there is a significant difference between the baskets of the rich and the poor.
The poor man, he postulates, wove the basket out of myrtle leaves specifically
for this purpose. Since it is a labor of love, reflecting his personal <i>mesiras
nefesh</i> for the <i>mitzvah</i>, the basket thus becomes an integral part of
the <i>mitzvah</i>. It is not simply a means to an end, enabling the farmer to
give the fruit to the <i>kohein</i>, but rather it assumes the status of the <i>mitzvah</i>
itself; the poor man who toiled and gave of himself in making the basket elevates
the basket to become part and parcel of the <i>mitzvah</i>. It is for this
reason that we honor the poor and the <i>kohein</i> keeps the basket in
recognition of his noble efforts.</P>

<P>I believe this insight of
the Malbim is extremely significant and poignant. The Torah is teaching that
when one invests in something, it becomes an integral part of oneself. The
Talmud (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 38a) teaches that a person prefers a <i>kav</i>
of his own produce more than nine <i>kavs</i> of his fellow's produce
which could be purchased with the proceeds from a timely sale of his produce.
Rashi explains this is the case because that which one toils to produce is most
precious to him. What is true in the physical and materialistic realm is
equally true in the spiritual realm. <i>Avos D'rabi Nason</i> (3:6)
teaches that one <i>mitzvah</i> observed with <i>tza'ar</i> - difficulties
and challenge - is more dear to Hashem than one hundred performed with ease.</P>

<P>Dovid <i>Hamelech</i> in
his opening chapter of Tehilim praises the one "whose desire is in the
Torah of Hashem, and in His Torah he meditates day and night" (1:2). At
first it is called the Torah of Hashem, but once an individual has studied it and mastered it, it
is called "his Torah", namely that of the scholar (<i>Kiddushin</i> 32b.)</P>

<P>Moreover, the
Torah in the beginning of the <i>Vayikra</i> speaks of the <i>korban olah</i> which
begins with the bringing of an animal, then the bringing of a bird, and finally
the bringing of a meal offering. Interestingly, it is just regarding this
latter offering that the Torah describes the donor as <i>nefesh</i> ("if a
soul will bring a meal offering" <i>Vayikra</i> 2:1.) Rashi cites from the
Talmud (<i>Menachos</i> 104b) that since most often it
is a poor man that brings a meal offering as his <i>korban olah</i>, Hashem looks
upon this act as if he offered his soul.</P>

<P>The lesson of
the Malbim is most appropriate as we prepare for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
Make <i>mitzvos</i> yours. One way, suggests the Chazon Ish (<i>Emunah U'bitchon</i> Chap. 3,5-10is to study the <i>mitzvos</i>. The more one understands
what appears to be the technical aspects of the <i>mitzvos</i> and the
philosophical teachings of the <i>mitzvos</i>, the more it becomes part of you.
Why do we blow thirty sounds, the <i>tekios d'm'yushov</i>, before the
Mussaf prayer on Rosh Hashana? Why do we blow thirty sounds during the <i>shemoneh
esrei</i>? Why forty at the end of the <i>mussaf</i>? What is Biblical and what
is Ravnic? Studying the above enables one to make the <i>mitzvah</i> theirs.</P>

<P>Finally, as
the basket is upgraded and is reckoned as an integral part of the <i>mitzvah</i>,
may we who perform and are about to approach a season of many <i>mitzvos</i>,
become basket-like, namely, not just to do good, but to be good. </P>

<P>Before wrestling with the angel of Eiasav, Yaakov "was
left alone" (<i>Bereishis</i> 32:25). The Talmud (<i>Chulin</i> 91a)
understands the verse to not only provide the environment and arena for Yaakov
to be attacked, but also to address why he was alone. The word <i>levado</i> - alone
is understood to include <i>lechado</i>, for his small jars and lesser
important property, as the Torah previously informs us that he transported his
possessions to the other side of the stream. Yaakov went back to retrieve <i>pachim
kitanim</i> - incidentals. At first glance it seems most challenging to
understand why Yaakov put himself at risk of being mugged? Rav Elazar
explains that regarding the righteous, "their property is most precious
to them for they do not engage in thievery".</p>

<P>Rav Yosef Salant <i>zt"l</i> in his B'ear Yosef
offers the following keen insight: the Talmud (<i>Yuma</i> 38a-b) teaches in
the name of Ben Zoma, "one's livelihood and position in life is destined
with incredible precision On High. A person cannot encroach upon what has been
designated for the next one, and the reign of one King cannot usurp nor
encroach the reign of his predecessor even a hairsbreadth". Hashem thus
gives each person what they need, when they need it. Therefore, everything that
one is given is to help him fulfill his unique function and destiny in this
world. Similarly, the Ohr HaChaim explains the verse, "when you lend
money to My people, to the poor person who is with you" (<i>Shemos</i>
22:24) to mean that Hashem entrusted you with additional money to lend to the
poor, or most specifically, Hashem gave you what the poor individual needs, so
that you have the opportunity to give. The concept of <i>hashgasha pratis</i> -
Divine providence is thus at the crux of this matter, and Yaakov is teaching
how everything is to be appreciated, evaluated, and ultimately utilized in a
productive fashion. There is no such thing as <i>pachim ketanim</i>, incidentals
that are unnecessary; if G-d has given it to a person, it is to be used wisely.</p>

<P>There is a delicious <i>Medrash</i> that substantiates this
lesson. The <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> (Rus 607) relates that after a pious man lost
his fortune and while working as a day laborer, Eliyanhu <i>Hanavi</i> appeared
to him and offered him six good years of plenty. He was to choose if he wanted
them now or at the end of his life, ensuring that he would not have to worry in
his retirement years. He consulted with his intelligent wife, who advised to
take the good years immediately, and miraculously their children found a
treasure to maintain them comfortably for six years. His wife of sterling
character said that once Hashem has shined his countenance upon them, they
should share their wealth with others, perhaps He would extend their good
fortune. She had her child transcribe daily their charitable acts and
beneficence. At the end of six years, Eliyahu came and announced that the
Divine infusion was over, and he came to retrieve the remaining monies. The man
said, "as I took the money based upon the counsel of my wife, I will only
return the balance with her counsel." Her response was to tell Eliyahu
that if he has found more deserving individuals to entrust the money, then
understandably take it. Thereupon, Hashem evaluated their acts of kindness and
showered them with more blessings, enabling them to do more kindness.</p>

<P>I believe the lesson that Yaakov is teaching regarding
actualizing potentials is not only to be understood regarding one's
material possessions, but indeed regarding all virtues and characteristics that
each and every individual is endowed with. On the verse "let us make
man" (<i>Bereishis</i> 1:26) the commentaries explain that Hashem said, I
will take from all the creations, from all the creatures, and incorporate the
unique yet diversified qualities of each, and infuse them into man. Each person
is different in their specific mix of the above traits. As the Yiddish
expression goes, no one has it all. However, what you do have, don't
squander or allow to remain unused or misused. </p>

<P>One who is blessed with more wisdom and the ability to
discern and analyze dare not waste and allow to lie dormant his intellectual
abilities. Similarly with health, one must appreciate this gift and nurture G-d's
gift of health and even one's physical appearance. (On a personal note, I
encouraged my young children to brush their teeth, by reminding them to brush
Hashem's teeth). Courage, leadership and strength are among the many
qualities that <i>pachim ketanim</i> teaches us to be careful not to waste. </p>

<P>Interestingly, Rav Elazar said that the righteous are
careful with their possessions, as they do not engage in theft. I would like to
suggest an additional explanation. The Vilna Gaon, as cited at the end of <i>Maalas
HaTorah</i> written by his brother Reb Avraham, commenting on the phrase "<i>v'sain
chelkainu b'sorasecha</i> - grant our share in your Torah", notes
that as each person has their specific <i>tafkid</i>-purpose and function in this
world, Hashem endows them with the necessary qualities and virtues to fulfill
that <i>tafkid</i>. At the conclusion of <i>Yom Kippur</i>, in the <i>Neilah</i>
service we ask for forgiveness, "<i>l'maan nechdal m'oshek
ya-deinu</i> - so that we will withdraw from the theft in our hands",
and Rav Soloveitchik <i>zt"l</i> suggested that indeed at the core of all
sins is theft, namely misusing Hashem's gifts to us, in a way that He
never intended. Similarly, Yaakov's returning for <i>pachim ketanim</i> demonstrates
that not actualizing our abilities and potential is also a form thievery, having
received God's gifts but failed to use them to their fullest.</p>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Benjamin Yudin]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2014]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: 9av]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The Shabbos prior to <i>Tisha B'Av</i> derives its name from the
<i>haftorah</i>, whereby Isaiah the prophet castigates Israel for its sins, and
prepares us for the national day or mourning, reminding us why we lost the <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i>. The <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> unified the Jewish nation. To begin with,
the <i>korbanos</i> were for the nation. On a daily basis, the <i>Korban Tamid</i>,
the one lamb brought in the morning and the one lamb brought in the afternoon,
were on behalf of the entire populace. One <i>Kurban Mussaf</i> - additional
offering - was brought on behalf of the nation every <i>Shabbos</i>, <i>Rosh
Chodesh</i>, and <i>Yom Tov</i>. Even the atonement for each individual on <i>Yom
Kippur</i> came about through the representative of the people, the <i>Kohein
Gadol</i>.</p>

<P>The Ramchal (<i>Daas Tvunos</i> 160) teaches that the <i>kohein</i>
officiating at the <i>Korban Tamid</i> had the challenging job of getting into
the mindset of representing and reflecting all of <i>Klal Yisrael</i>. Just as
they were represented by the <i>kohanim</i> in their <i>avodah</i> (actual performance
of the offerings), the <i>leviim</i> with their singing and music, and
Israelites with their <i>ma'amad</i> prayers, the <i>kohein</i> channeled
the unique requests as per the character traits of the multitudes of the nation
and offered them to Hashem.</p>

<P>King David expressed it in <i>Tehillim</i> (122:2) "Built
up Jerusalem is like a city that is united together". The <i>mishna</i> (<i>Avos</i>
5:5) teaches that no one complained that the accommodations were stressful and
crowded for the three pilgrim festivals in Jerusalem. The Chasam Sofer
understands this to mean, that it was most certainly stressful but the higher
cause and privilege of being in close proximity to the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>
united the people, and thus no one complained.</p>

<P>Moreover, the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> was the vehicle whereby the
Jewish nation experienced <i>Hashgacha Pratis</i> (Divine providence) on an
ongoing basis. The above cited <i>mishna</i> enumerates ten open miracles that
occurred therein regularly, showing His presence in their midst. Our observance
of <i>Tisha B'Av</i> is a strong reminder of what we are missing today.</p>

<P>This <i>Tisha B'Av</i> is most unique. It is coming during the
time of the unification for the Jewish people that we have not felt for a long
time. I met two days ago with Mrs. Rachel Frankel, the mother of Naftali <i>Hy"d</i>.
After sharing with her our deepest personal sympathy and expressing condolences
on behalf of our congregation and community in New Jersey, I told her of monies
that were donated in memory of the three boys to be used at the discretion of
the families. Her immediate response was to use the funds to further the
feelings of <i>achdus</i> and closeness that presently envelopes the land. Mr.
Shaar, the father of Gil'ad <i>Hy"d</i> hoped that this incredible
outpouring of prayer and concern on behalf of world Jewry could help stem the
tide of assimilation and intermarriage in the United States.</p>

<P>The unity in Israel today is unfortunately being continued by
the war in Gaza. If only the West Bank were being rocketed, one could imagine
some responding by asking, "why are they living there?" But when
rockets fly towards Tel Aviv, Ashkelon, and the airport, it most certainly
unites all Israel in <i>imo anochi b'tzarah</i>, we are all in this together.
In addition, approximately a half million Israelis have on their phones an app
that apprises them of when a siren goes off anywhere in the country, creating <i>Kol
Yisrael areivim zeh l'zeh</i>, an intense feeling of camaraderie and concern
one for another.</p>

<P>Moreover, we too have witnessed to date incredible <i>Hashgacha pratis</i>.
<OL>
<LI>The iron dome was out of commission one day last week for eight
hours outside of Ashkelon, and during these eight hours not a single rocket
came.</LI>
<LI>Last week, when over 1,400 rockets had been shot into Israel and
but one casualty, then the Turkish Prime Minister said "It cannot be
true". He doesn't realize (<i>Tehillim</i> 121:4), "Behold, He neither
slumbers nor sleeps, the Guardian of Israel".</LI>
<LI>A soldier was shot last night and the bullet was intercepted by
the hand grenade he was wearing, which miraculously did not explode, damaging neither him nor his fellow soldiers.</LI>
</ol>
</P>
<P>The lists of the miracles that we witness daily are manifold.</p>

<P><I>Tisha B'Av</i> reminds us that unity and <i>Hashgacha pratis</i> is
to come from a positive source, the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, and not
unfortunately from the horror of kidnapping of innocent teenagers and miracles
from the battle front. Going into this <i>Tisha B'av</i> we are cognizant of (<i>Tehillim</i>
116:3) "Distress and grief I find, and I invoke the name of Hashem".
Our prayers and <i>Kinos</i> are in response to the fifty three families that
to date have made the supreme sacrifice for <i>Am Yisrael</i>. Our war with
Gaza is but a continuation of the tragic circumstances that occur in the
absence of the Third <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>.
</P>
<P>
The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Berachos</i> 8a) teaches that since the destruction of
the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, Hashem takes refuge in the study of Torah. I understand
this to mean that just as the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> unified our people, Torah also
has ability to unite our people. Case in point, notes the <i>Aruch Ha'Shulchan
</i>in his introduction to <i>Choshen Mishpat</i>, Jews all over the world keep
the same Shabbos, use the same <i>esrog</i>, keep Kosher, laws of family
purity, etc.; we are all united through the Torah.</p>

<P>As we prepare to sit low and fast this <i>Tisha B'Av</i>, and
pine for the day that our unity will emanate from (<i>Tehillim</i> 116:13),
"The cup of salvations I will raise, and the name of Hashem I will
invoke", I would like to suggest a few ways to perpetuate these remarkable
feelings of unity, please God soon beyond the war. Firstly, take note: it is
not Hillel, but Shamai who teaches (<i>Avos</i> 1:15) to greet everyone
favorably, with a cheerful countenance. He does not mean only those in one's
circle, who share your character and ideology, rather go out of your way to
show kinship, respect and brotherhood to all. The <i>Yerushalmi</i> (<i>Yuma</i>
1) teaches that the destruction of the first Temple was but the roof of the
building. The second <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> which was destroyed because of
baseless and senseless hatred had its very foundation was destroyed. We need
heavy doses of <i>ahavas chinum</i>, love for each and every Jew, because if we
have one Father, then we really are brothers and sisters.</p>

<P>Secondly, don't just pray for our soldiers in Gaza, but get the
name of a specific soldier, for when you focus on him among the rest, your
prayer is more focused. May I suggest that you keep in mind Amatzya Chaim <i>ben</i> Chedva Malka,
who sustained serious injuries to his legs and doctors hope he will walk in several weeks.</p>

<P>Finally, your acts of <i>chessed</i>, your prayers, and your Torah study, are the parcels that we can send from abroad to the soldiers and the rest of Israel.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: pesach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>While the taste of <i>matzah</i> is still in our mouth from the <i>Afikoman</i> (and
according to the <i>Gaon</i> of Vilna (<i>Maaseh Rav</i> 185) there is still a <i>mitzvah</i>
<i>kiyumis lechatchila</i> to eat <i>matzah</i> each day of Pesach and thereby reify
the biblical description of eating <i>matzah</i> for seven days (<i>Shemos</i>
23:15)) I would like to share an insight to the <i>Hagadah</i> that is relevant
to all of Pesach and indeed the entire year.</p>

<P>Right before we begin Rav's <i>hagadah</i> of "<i>mitchila ovdei avodah zara hayu
avoseinu</i> - originally our ancestors were idol worshipers" (<i>Pesachim</i>
116a) we declare, "<i>yachol meiRosh Chodesh</i> - one might think that
the obligation to discuss the exodus commences on the first day of the month of
<i>Nissan</i>." What would prompt one to celebrate on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>?
At first glance, as the Torah teaches (<i>Shemos</i> 12:2) it was on <i>Rosh Chodesh
Nissan</i> that the Jewish nation experienced a revelation of Hashem to Moshe
and Aharon to be communicated to them. This Divine occurrence and relationship
is certainly worth celebrating. However, I believe there is much more.</p>

<P>The first <i>mitzvah</i> given to the fledgling nation in Egypt was not only their unique calendar, but
the ability and mandate to sanctify. The <i>Medrash</i> (<i>Shemos Rabbah</i>
15:2) teaches that prior to this first <i>mitzvah</i>, any and all <i>kedusha</i>
in this world came from Hashem. With the exodus that changed and the Jewish
people "shall be holy for Me, for I Hashem am Holy, and I have separated
you (the Jewish people) from the peoples to be Mine" (ibid 15:24.) On <i>Pesach</i>
we not only celebrate our emergence from slavery to freedom and royalty (<i>Sefer
Hachinuch</i> 16), but also from slavery to sanctity. The <i>Medrash</i> continues,
"the nation of Israel is holy and they sanctify the month, in addition
they sanctify Me".</p>

<P>Sefer Shemos</i> begins with the very formation of the Jewish people, hence it is called the Second Book (see Netizv's
introduction to <i>Shemos</i>) the first book deals with the creation of the
world and the second deals with the creation of the Jewish nation. We were
created with the capacity and the charge to sanctify ourselves and the world
about us. Hashem liberated the Jewish people with a mission: we were to accept
His Torah fifty days after the exodus and through our living and fulfilling His
Torah with which He, The Holy One, is one, we become filled with sanctity.</p>

<P>Moreover, says Rab Chaim Voloziner, (<i>Nefesh Hachaim</i> 1:3) the effect of our actions
is way beyond our comprehension. Our positive acts, words, and even holy
thoughts generate <i>kedusha</i> in this world and beyond. The Talmud (<i>Berachos</i>
64a) explains the verse "and all your sons will be disciples of Hashem,
and abundant will be the peace of your sons" (Isaiah 54:13) to mean,
"do not read your sons but your builders." The Nefesh Hachayim
takes this most literally. Hence, the observance of Shabbos by Jews in one
location might well prevent assimilation and intermarriage in another. This
injection of <i>kedusha</i> - sanctity, according to the Ohr Hachaim <i>Hakadosh</i>,
is renewed annually, as the verse states, "It is God who <u>takes</u>
them out of Egypt" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 23:22) using the word "takes - <i>motzei'um</i>"
which includes the present.</p>

<P>Two cases in point: if one was to train a monkey to bake <i>matzah</i>, and we would all
watch the monkey move with alacrity in a completely <i>chometz</i>-free
environment, and complete the baking within eighteen minutes, that <i>matzah</i>
could be eaten on Pesach it is <i>chometz</i>-free but could not be used at the
<i>seder</i> to fulfill one's <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>matzah</i>. What is
missing is the <i>lishma</i> - the thought and speech of man that endows this
unleavened bread with the characteristic of "bread of faith" (<i>Zohar</i>.)</p>

<P>The holiest object of the Jewish people is the <i>sefer</i> Torah. Once again it is not the
calligrapher that creates a holy object. It is the <i>sofer</i> - scribe who
before he writes a single letter articulates that it is being written for the
purpose of the sanctity of the Torah Scroll. His character, persona, and his personally
living the Torah endows the <i>sefer</i> Torah with sanctity.</p>

<P>"<i>Yachol merosh chodesh</i>", yes, I would have thought we should celebrate on <i>Rosh
Chodesh </i>Nissan, as that is the anniversary of our being endowed with
sanctity. On this Shabbos <i>chol haMoed</i> Pesach, which has a double
sanctity of both Hashem and man, as He established the sanctity of Shabbos and
the Jewish nation the sanctity of the holidays, may we live up to the potential
and faith that Hashem has invested in us.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: korach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Korach
is a tragic figure in a tragic story. At first glance his platform of
"the entire assembly all of them are holy and Hashem is among them"
is valid, however the conclusion of the verse "why do you exalt
yourselves over the Congregation of Hashem" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 16:3) is
most perplexing. How could he question the suitability and eligibility of Moshe
and Aaron to lead the Jewish people? The Torah testifies that at the <i>Yam Suf</i>,
"they had faith in Hashem and in Moshe as his servant" (<i>Shemos</i>
14:31.) In addition, when Hashem tells Moshe of the initial plan at Sinai, He
informs him "behold I come to you in a thickness of the cloud, so that
the people will hear as I speak to you, and they will also believe in you
forever" (ibid 18:3.) How is it possible in that context that Korach
challenges Moshe's authority?</p>

<P>Moreover,
Korach was already an accomplished "somebody". He was wise,
wealthy, among the chosen few that carried the Holy Ark (<i>Medrash Rabbah</i>,
<i>Bamidbar</i> 18:3), and was endowed with prophecy, so what led him to this
folly? Rashi gives two answers.</p>

<P>The
first answer is given in his commentary on the first verse, citing the <i>medrash</i>
that Korach was motivated by jealousy. He was disappointed that he was not
selected to be the head of the entire Kehas families in <i>shevet</i> Levi. He
accused Moshe of selecting a different cousin, Elitzafon the son of Uziel, on
his own, when in reality the designation was made by Hashem himself (ibid 18:2.)</p>

<P>Interestingly,
Rashi provides a second reason that led Korach astray. Rashi adds "his
eye led him to error" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 16:7.) He saw prophetically a
great chain of distinguished descendants coming from him, including the prophet
Shmuel. In addition, he saw no less than twenty four groups of rotations of his
descendants serving a week each in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, and thus reasoned
that these extraordinary progeny will ensure his survival in his confrontation
with Moshe.</p>

<P>Is
Rashi providing two different motives to explain Korach's behavior? Are
these explanations in sync or in conflict with each other?</p>

<P>I
would like to suggest that in reality they are one and the same. Rashi's
first explanation defines the <i>negius</i> (bias) that consciously or
subconsciously consumed Korach. Once he convinced himself that he was slighted
and wronged, once his desire for honor consumed him, then, in keeping with the
Torah's description of the effects being bribed has on one's
judgement, Korach now viewed everything through tinted glasses. He did see
correctly that Shmuel and twenty four prestigious watches would descend from
him. However, unlike his reading of self-aggrandizement and glory, the Ravs
teach that he warranted this special progeny through his sons who did <i>teshuvah</i>,
and because of the <i>kiddush</i> Hashem (the sanctification and glorification
of Hashem's name) that emerged from those buried alive proclaiming "Moshe
is true and his Torah is true, and we are liars" (<i>Bava Basra</i> 74a).
</p>

<P>The <i>Mesilas
Yesharim</i> (chapter 11) teaches that the most toxic bias is the lust for
honor. He cites the Zohar (3:158) that explains the downfall of the <i>meraglim</i>
(the 12 spies that were sent to spy out the land of Israel) who returned with
the most devastating and damaging report. The exact question that was asked
above regarding Korach may be asked regarding these spies. The Torah testifies
"they were all distinguished men" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 13:3) and Hashem
had assured them it was "a good and spacious land" "flowing
with milk and honey" (Shemos 3:8.) How, then, could they return with a
report that contradicted G-d himself? The Zohar explains that their fear of
losing their positions of leadership which would not be renewed in the environment
and setting of the land of Israel. Thus, to retain their honorable stations they
too wore the tinted glasses of <i>negius</i>-bias and their report was couched
to ensure they will retain the status-quo in the desert.</p>

<P>The
third powerful example of <i>negius</i> is that of Yerovom ben Nevot who was
chosen by Hashem to lead the ten tribes, the Kingdom of Israel, which was taken
away from King Solomon after his death. Yerovom was fearful that if his
subjects would tRavel to the <i>Bais Hamikdash</i> three times a year to
celebrate the pilgrim festivals, they would become followers of Rechavom King
of Judah. Yerovom therefore forbade his people from going to Yerushalyim and
established golden calves in the north and south of the land. Hashem provides
the opportunity for Yerovom to repent by assuring him that were he to repent,
he would not only go to <i>Gan</i> Eden upon his passing, but would even have
the privilege to stroll with Hashem himself and King David. Faced with this
opportunity Yerovom asked but one question: who is first in this procession? He
understood that Hashem would lead, but who is next? When Hashem told him he
would have to take a back seat to King David, he responded "I am not
interested" (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 102a.) Such is the drive and power of the
lust for honor. Too often we don't see it in ourselves, but we can and do
see it in others.</p>

<P>The <i>mishna</i>
teaches, "accept a teacher upon yourself, and acquire a friend for
yourself" (<i>Avos</i> 1:6.) I would like to suggest another reason for
this teaching. We are taught that <i>adom karov l'atzmo</i>-a person is
naturally biased in favor of himself (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 10a.) We are too often
quick to see the faults and shortcomings of others, but not our own. We can see
through the next one; we can connect the dots of their rejection, hurt, slight,
humiliation, and their subsequent actions that often deviate from their
otherwise pristine character. Be that friend. Point out the <i>negius</i>-bias
that is obstructing their clear thought perspective and vision. A good friend
is a good listener.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: noach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The Kabalists answer the basic question of why Hashem
created the world with the comforting response of "<i>tevah hatov
l'heitiv</i> - the nature of the Good One is to bestow goodness." Rashi
(<i>Breishis</i> 2:4) notes that this world was created with the letter <i>hey</i>
which has an opening at the bottom, symbolizing man's descending into
oblivion if he is not successful in leading a righteous life. Moreover, we are
taught that the world to come is symbolized by the letter <i>yud</i>, the
smallest letter, proclaiming that those privileged to go there are the minority
of the population. If Hashem is good, and He breathes a living soul of His
essence into man, literally a chip off the magnificent spiritual block, then
why did He make the world so challenging that only a minority end up succeeding
and reaching the world to come?</p>

<P>The high failure rate in this world is further emphasized by
the Mishnah (<i>Avos perek</i> 5) which teaches that in the ten generations
from Adam to Noach the great majority of the world population did not live a
noble life. Similarly, from Noach to Avraham there were again ten generations
and again man failed to live up to his potential, and Avraham received the
reward that was initially allocated to all of them.</p>

<P>The <i>Ohr Ha-Chaim Hakadosh</i> (<i>Breishis</i> 3:4), in
beginning to analyze Adam's sin of eating from the <i>eitz ha-daas</i>, similarly
asks why Hashem did not diminish the power and attraction of the <i>yetzer
harah </i>thus making man's mastery over it easier and more manageable?
His answer is that in accordance with the challenge and effort to defeat the <i>yetzer
harah</i> is the reward and benefit for both this world and the world to come.
He cites the <i>Mishnah</i> (<i>Avos</i> 5:26) which states, "in
accordance with the exertion is the reward."</p>

<P>The Ramchal (<i>Da'as Tvunos</i> 18) teaches that the
good which Hashem extends to man is the opportunity to connect with and benefit
from the <i>Shechina</i> - the Divine. To capitalize on this opportunity one
must fulfill the six hundred and eleventh commandment (<i>Devorim</i> 28:9) of
"<i>v'holachto biderachav</i> - walking in His ways." Man is
to emulate Hashem who is all giving and perform acts of kindness and
spirituality.</p>

<P>Were man to receive a reward without performing and
accomplishing to earn it, the reward would be "<i>Na'amah
d'kisufah</i> - bread of shame", i.e. degrading and debasing.
Perhaps this is what our Ravs are teaching when they state (<i>Shabbos</i>
127a), "receiving guests is greater than greeting the Divine Presence",
for it is better to have a relationship with Hashem in a manner of giving, and
thereby emulating His exalted character, than to encounter Him by simply being
the recipient.</p>

<P>What emerges is the realization that meaning, purpose, and
fulfillment in this world are, as stated by the introductory words of <i>Mesilas
Yesharim</i>, comprised of overcoming the obstacles and challenges of the evil
inclination. Freud taught that man is inherently bad and possesses an id which
yearns for negativity; Judaism says man possesses a <i>yid</i> - a holy Divine
image that enables him to overcome his desire for bad. Man is to emulate Hashem,
and as His nature is to do good so too must man use his free will to overcome
the desire to do bad and do good instead.</p>

<P>Our initial question assumed that tests and challenges are
not really good for man. However, the Ramban in his commentary on the <i>akeida</i>
(<i>Breishis</i> 22:1) teaches that Hashem only tests those that can pass the
test. Avraham became the great father of our nation because he was tested with
ten tests through which he became elevated and actualized his potential. Each
individual as well is to be cognizant of the fact that they possess a unique
mission and potential and a unique array of challenges. Our challenges are
Hashem's way of offering us His <i>l'heitiv</i> - His ultimate
goodness, which is the opportunity to grow and earn the best of this world and
the next. Indeed, the <i>Ohr Ha-chaim</i> cited earlier ends his treatment of
this most important concept with the words "praiseworthy is the people
for whom this is so". It is all a matter of perspective.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vayakhel]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>At the beginning of <i>Parshas Vayakhel</i> Hashem enjoins
the Jewish nation to observe the Shabbos. It is interesting to note how <i>Anshei
Knesses Hagedolah</i> (Men of the Great Assembly) and our <i>Mesorah</i> unbroken
tradition, teaches that we read the verse (<i>Shemos</i> 35:2), "<i>sheishes
yomim <u>tai-a-se</u> melacha</i> - six days work <u>is to be done</u>",
and not six days "<i>ta-aseh melacha</i> - you shall do work." The
latter form is clearly the active form with man being the one charged to do and
accomplish. The former however is the passive reflexive form, with the emphasis
being on the result, i.e. the work will be done. The <i>tai-a-se</i> usage
reminds man that his involvement and energy is crucial, but ultimately it is
not he who is effecting and producing but rather a higher source is, namely
Hashem.</p>

<P>With this understanding and orientation, it is much easier
to accept and comply with the <i>mitzvah</i> of Shabbos. If man is <i>ta-a-se</i>
- the producer, then the Divine edict to desist on the Shabbos from work is a
major demand and imposition. It is asking much of man who is productive all
week long to forgo some of his productivity in emulation of and submission to
G-d. If however, man recognizes that all his successes are due to the help and
assistance of Hashem and that Hashem, as we understand from <i>tai-a-se</i> (see
<i>Devarim</i> 8:18 with <i>Targum Unkelos</i>), provides us with the
intuition, ideas and notions to invest in a particular endeavor, then we can be
confident that just as He provides all week long, so too will He provide for
the Shabbos.</p>

<P>What emerges is an incredible display of sensitivity that
Hashem affords man. There is a basic human condition called<b> </b><i>na-amah d'kisufah</i>,
literally bread of embarrassment (<i>Ramchal, Daas Tevunos</i> 1:18). If one is
constantly receiving without working or earning his keep, in short time most
individuals will experience a sense of shame, worthlessness and depression.
Thus, it is a kindness of Hashem that He allows us to participate in our
earning a living, letting us feel that we are major players in earning our keep
in this world.</p>

<P>I believe this idea might well be included in the
introductory <i>bracha</i> to every <i>Shmoneh Esrei</i>, "<i>gomail
chasadim tovim</i>" which literally means He performs and bestows good
kindnesses. Why describe the kindness as "<i>tovim</i> - good"? Isn't
kindness by nature good? The answer is based upon the above idea. That He
sustains us is a kindness, and that He extends dignity to us at the same time
is the fulfillment of <i>tovim</i>.</p>

<P>The 611th mitzvah is to emulate Hashem - "<i>V'halachta
b'drachav</i>" (<i>Devarim</i> 28:9). The Talmud (<i>Mishna Demai</i>
4:7) uses the term <i>gomlin</i> as one of reciprocity, as in a situation that
we are concerned regarding two individuals that each will perform a service for
the next one, thereby each benefiting themselves. Ideally, this is the way we
are to be <i>gomel chesed</i> to someone. Rather than perform an act of
kindness in a fashion that the recipient feels put upon and feels indebted for
the service, as they now "owe you one", ideally, one is to perform the
kindness in a way that the one performing it communicates that he is actually
receiving by giving and thanks the recipient for the opportunity to give. Through
<i>tai-a-se</i> Hashem allows us to feel good while receiving, and we must strive
in our personal and communal <i>chassadim</i> to do the same.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vayetze]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>When reading <i>Parshas Vayeitzei</i>, of course we need to
know that Yaakov begins building the nation of Israel, with eleven sons and one
daughter. Why, however, are we told of the challenging work environment that
Yaakov experienced working for Lavan? Yaakov (31:6-7) tells his wives,
"now you have known that it was with all my might that I served your
father, yet your father mocked me and changed my wages one hundred times, but
G-d did not permit him to harm me". Moreover, (31:38) "these 20
years I have been with you, your ewes and she-goats never miscarried, nor did I
eat rams of your flock . That which was mangled I never brought you, I myself
would bear the loss, from me you would exact it, whether it was stolen by day
or stolen by night".</p>

<P>Yaakov flees with his family and household, fearful that
were he to say goodbye to his father in law the latter would have robbed him of
all his possessions. When Lavan pursues Yaakov and rummages through all of
Yaakov's possessions and can't even find one object that belonged
to him, at that point Yaakov is understandably ready to explode. <i>Chazal</i>
(Medrash Tanchuma 13) say, "[better] the anger and assertiveness of the
Forefathers than the humility of the sons". The response of Yaakov
constitutes an incredible lesson in "<i>derech eretz kodma L'Torah</i>
- refined character / <i>mentchlichkeit</i> is a prerequisite for Torah".
Instead of Yaakov blasting Lavan and calling him all kinds of derogatory names (which
he richly deserved), Yaakov simply exonerates himself, thereby implicating
Lavan. We are taught, (31:36) "then Yaakov became angered and he took up
his grievance with Lavan: Yaakov spoke up and said to Lavan, "What is my
transgression? What is my sin that you have hotly pursued me?"</p>

<P>While we already knew of Yaakov's great physical strength
from his single-handedly moving the boulder from atop the well (29:10), here we
see his incredible strength of character. The <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (241)
explains the challenging prohibition of <i>Lo Sikom</i> - not to take revenge -
in the following way: "one must believe and know that whatever happens to
oneself be it good or bad, is caused and comes directly from Hashem."
Unquestionably, the perpetrator of the negative act will be punished as he had
free will, but that a particular individual was at a specific place at a
specific time and affected by the perpetrator's action is not by chance
but orchestrated from On High. Therefore, one is prohibited to take revenge
against someone who acted badly towards him. The <i>Chinuch</i> reminds us that
Dovid responded to the curse of Shimi <i>ben</i> Gerah (2 Shmuel 16:10) by
saying that is was Divinely sanctioned.</p>

<P>The powerful lesson that Yaakov is teaching is taught in the
Talmud (<i>Chullin</i> 89a), "Rav Ila'a said the world exists
only on account of one who muzzles himself at a time of provocation, and
refrains from reacting". This is good advice and counsel, both
theologically and psychologically. If one holds on to anger and maintains the
flames of resentment regarding the past, it blemishes their personality by not
permitting him to actualize his potential in the present and future. Being stuck
in the past, the impacts of which are too often unfixable, robs one of his <i>simchas
ha-chaim</i> - the ability to appreciate and capitalize on the Divine gift of
life.</p>

<P>The Talmud (<i>Taanis</i> 25b) relates that once in response
to a draught, Rav Eliezer led the prayer service of twenty four blessings
that were prescribed for a fast day, but was not answered, i.e. it did not
rain. Subsequently, Rav Akiva prayed the <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i> and it rained.
The Ravs began murmuring against Rav Eliezer and concluded that Rav Akiva
was greater since his prayers were answered. A heavenly voice declared
"not because this one is greater than the other, but because this one is
a forgiving person, <i>ma-avir al midosov</i>, whereas the other is not a
forgiving person." The commentaries explain, since Rav Akiva was a
forgiving person Hashem acted likewise toward him and forgave the sins of the
people and blessed them with rain.</p>

<P>Following this noble behavior is, in addition, a fulfillment
of the six hundred and eleventh <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>v'halachta
b'drachav</i> - emulating Hashem. After Moshe broke the first set of
tablets following the sin of the golden calf, Hashem instructs Moshe to prepare
a second set of tablets to replace the first "<i>asher shibarta</i> - that
you shattered" (<i>Shemos</i> 34:1). The Talmud (<i>Shabbos</i> 87a)
understands these words to be Hashem's agreeing with Moshe's
decision to break the original tablets and complimenting him for doing so. The
Torah <i>Temimah</i> on this verse explains where <i>Chazal</i> see that
compliment in the <i>passuk</i> by highlighting the fact that it is human
nature that if one does something bad in anger or impetuously, being reminded of
that act causes shame and discomfort. Thus, if Hashem disagreed with the
breaking of the first <i>luchos</i>, His merely instructing Moshe to replace
the first tablets would've sufficed to indicate that disagreement. By
adding the apparently superfluous "<i><u>asher shibarta</u></i>" Hashed
indicated that He was complimenting Moshe.</p>

<P>We are living in challenging times. The four widows - Chaya
Levine, Breine Goldberg, Yakova Kupinsky and Bashi Twersky - of the <i>kedoshim</i>
killed in the horrific attack in Har Nof appealed, "with tears and hearts
broken, turn to the house of Israel, to stay united so as to merit compassion
and mercy from On High. They specifically asked that we take upon ourselves to
increase love and brotherliness between man and his fellow man, between our
varied communities and among different sectors of the community". I just
wish to add and reiterate, more specifically, just when you are right as Yaakov
was - let go.</p>

<P><i>Ma nishtana</i> Pesach, how different Pesach is, that it
has a <i>Parshas HaChodesh</i> preceding it, with the enumeration of the many <i>mitzvos</i>
associated with it - there is no special reading of the Torah with the laws of
Rosh HaShana, Yom Kippur or Sukkos before those <i>yomim toivm</i>. <i>Parshas
HaChodesh</i> gets its name from one <i>passuk</i> (<i>Shemos</i> 12:2) that
deals with the <i>mitzvah</i> of Rosh Chodesh and the unique Lunar/Solar
calendar that the Jewish nation follow. The remaining eighteen <i>pesukim</i>,
however, deal with the laws of Pesach, so why do we refer to this special
reading as "<i>Parshas HaChodesh</i>" instead of "<i>Parshas
HaPesach</i>"?</p>

<P>I believe that a very insightful <i>Medrash</i> (<i>Shemos
Rabbah</i> 15:24) sheds light and clarity on this matter. The Talmud (<i>Sanhedrin</i>
42a) teaches that upon seeing the new moon each month one is to recite a
blessing, but the Talmud does not provide us with the text of the <i>bracha</i>.
The <i>Medrash</i> posits three possibilities: the first is the text that we
follow, reciting a bracha that concludes, "<i>Mechadash Chadoshim</i> - He
who renews the months." The second opinion is that of "<i>Mekadash
Chadoshim</i> - He who sanctifies months." The third view is "<i>Mekadash
Yisroel</i> - He who sanctifies Israel." The <i>Medrash</i> continues and
says that we shouldn't be amazed or startled at this last opinion, for
indeed if Hashem did not sanctify Israel they in turn could not sanctify the
new moon. Thus, the foundation of the first <i>mitzvah</i> given to the Jewish
people in Egypt is the special gift and privilege extended to <i>Am Yisrael</i>
to sanctify.</p>

<P>There are, our Ravs note, three different forms of <i>kedusha</i>
(holiness): there is the <i>kedusha</i> of <i>zman</i> (time), <i>makom </i>(location),
and that of <i>guf</i> - an individual and/or an object. I believe the
appellation given to this special reading does not necessarily herald an
enumeration of upcoming <i>mitzvos</i>, but rather the opportunities for
upcoming sanctifications. In the ensuing eighteen <i>pesukim</i> we encounter
all different types of <i>kedusha</i>. We are charged (12:16) that the first
and last day are to be <i>mikra kodesh</i>, holy gatherings for proclaiming His
holiness, a personification of <i>kedushas ha-zman</i>, sanctifying time. The
second <i>kedusha</i> we find is that of <i>kedushas haguf</i>. At first glance
it is most strange that the Torah has to charge us (12:17) "<i>ushmartem
es ha-matzos</i> - you shall guard the <i>matzos</i>." This guarding must
mean something additional to preventing the <i>matzos</i> from becoming <i>chometz</i>
since the Torah already warns us (12:15) not to eat <i>chometz</i>. Therefore
our Ravs understand this to mean that we are not simply to bake <i>matza</i>,
but we are also to inject into this unleavened bread a <i>lishma</i> - a focus
and concentration that charges this bread with an elevated status, as it is now
an object of <i>mitzvah</i>. Just as with the writing of a <i>sefer</i> Torah,
it is the mindset and focus of the scribe thinking and articulating that his
efforts and energies are directed towards the fulfillment of the <i>mitzvah</i>,
similarly regarding <i>matzah</i> man endows the <i>matzah</i> with an elevated
status, akin to <i>kedushas</i> <i>haguf</i>. Finally, the placing of the blood
of the <i>korban Pesach</i> (12:7) on the two <i>mezuzos</i> (doorposts) and
lentil was endowing that home with <i>kedushas ha-makom</i>, elevating the home
to the status of the <i>mizbeach</i> (altar) which received the blood in place
of an altar.</p>

<P>In light of the above, one cannot question why we
don't have similar special Torah readings prior to the other <i>yomim
tovim</i>. In <i>Parshas HaChodesh</i> we are highlighting not only the first <i>mitzvah</i>
given to the Jewish people, namely our unique calendar, but we are also noting
that the former slaves are now likened to a <i>klei shares</i> (a holy vessel)
that sanctifies all that is placed therein.</p>

<P>The <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> notes, regarding several <i>mitzvos</i>
that focus on the remembrance of the Exodus, that through the events of <i>yetzias
Mitzrayim</i> we did not only go from slavery to freedom, but we even went from
slavery to aristocracy. <i>Parshas HaChodesh</i> reminds us that our <i>geula</i>
(freedom) begins when man is a <i>mekadeish</i>, i.e. when the individual and
community endowed with holiness and charged to be G-d like do so by sanctifying
all else. Freedom does not mean to do what one pleases within the law
(including, for example, doing nothing), rather it means to actualize
one's potential of being created in the image of G-d.</p>

<P><i>Parshas HaChodesh</i> is not only a check list of <i>mitzvos</i>
to do and abstain from regarding the forthcoming <i>yom tov</i>. Rather it
charges each of us to generate more <i>kedusha</i> in our personal and communal
lives. We are not only to gather and remove from our homes ten small wrapped
pieces of <i>chometz</i>, but also remove those factors and gadgets that introduce
a non-sanctified environment into the home. We don't put blood on our
doorposts and lentils, but our dining tables, in lieu of the <i>mizbeach</i>,
transform our homes. Are our tables set with <i>divrei</i> Torah or with frivolous
conversation? Most importantly, the special reading - <i>HaChodesh</i> - is a
charge to sanctify more of one's time by sharing one's Torah and
kindnesses with others. If we strive to attain these lofty goals, we can attain
the appellation of King David regarding man, "you have made him but
slightly less than the angels, and crowned him with soul and splendor" (<i>Tehilim</i>
8:6 .)</p>

<P>It is interesting to note that none of the 613 <i>mitzvos</i>
of the Torah appear in the one hundred and four verses in <i>Parshas Balak</i>.
There are, however, many important hashkafik principles contained therein. The
charge to the Jewish nation that their survival will depend on their remaining
separate and distinct from the other nations of the world is found in (23:9),
"<i>hein am l'vadad yishkon</i> - behold it is a nation that will
dwell in solitude". Moreover, the prophesy that there will always be
Jewish houses of assembly for prayer and study is contained in (24:5), "<i>mah
tovu ohalecha Yaakov mishkenosecha Yisroel</i> - how good are your tents,
O Jacob, your dwelling places, O Israel". Finally, the assurance that <i>Moshiach</i>
will redeem the Jewish nation at the end of history, is found in (24:17)
"<i>er'enu v'lo attah, ashurenu v'lo karov, darach
kochav mi'Yaakov v'kom shevet mi'Yisroel</i> - I shall see
him, but not now, I shall look at him, but it is not near. A star has issued
from Jacob and a scepter-bearer has risen from Israel". The Rambam (<i>Hilchos
Melachim</i> 11:1) therefore notes that whoever denies the concept of <i>Moshiach</i>
is denying the prophecy of Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i>.</p>

<P>In Avos (5:22) we are taught three differences between the
character traits of Avraham and Bilaam. The former possessed a good eye, a humble
spirit and a meek soul, while the latter had an evil eye, an arrogant spirit
and a greedy soul. The good eye is usually understood as one who is not jealous
of the next one's success in the materialistic realm, but this same difference
was present in their character in the spiritual realm as well. Rav Yosef Shalom
Elyashiv <i>zt''l</i> (in <i>Divrei Agadah</i>) notes a sharp
contrast between Moshe and Bilaam. When Moshe is informed (<i>Bamidbar</i> 11:27)
that "<i>Eldad u'Medad misnab'im bamachaneh</i> - Eldad and
Medad are prophesying in the camp" Moshe's immediate response was (ibid
29), "<i>u'mi yitein kol am Hashem nevi'im</i> - would that
the entire people of Hashem be prophets"; Moshe was more than willing to
share the wealth of the knowledge of G-d. The <i>Medrash</i> (<i>Yalkut
Shimoni</i>, <i>Yisro</i> 268), by contrast, teaches that when Hashem was about
to give the Torah the entire world stirred and realized something extraordinary
was about to happen, and therefore all of the Kings gathered to derive counsel
from Bilaam. They enquired (<i>Tehillim</i> 29:10), "has Hashem reverted
back to the flood?" Bilaam assured them that He already vowed not to
destroy the world again, rather He was giving His Torah to the nation of
Israel, and Bilaam then sent them each back to their respective people. Rav
Elyashiv notes that Bilaam had them in the palm of his hands and could
certainly have used the moment to spiritually energize the world by encouraging
them to accept the seven Noachide laws, but his evil eye prevented him from
sharing spirituality with others. It was a historical opportunity which was lost
and thus a dark moment in world history.</p>

<P>The Talmud (<i>Chullin</i> 92b) notes that while the nations
of the world violate the seven Noachide laws, there are three laws that they do
keep: they do not write a marriage contract for men to marry each other, they
do not sell the remains of a human corpse, and they honor the Torah. How sad
that in the times in which we live there is flagrant violation of all three of
these laws! For example, recognizing the demand for organs, it has become
prevalent that a cardiac arrest victim (having given explicit instructions) can
have the "plug pulled" and his organs harvested shortly thereafter
for a lucrative price. This is an outright violation of murder according to the
Torah.</p>

<P>On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States
legalized gay marriage throughout the country. It is amazing how history
repeats itself - historians attribute the downfall of both Greece and Rome to
their acceptance of sexual immorality. The <i>Medrash</i> (<i>Beraishis Rabbah</i>
26:5) teaches that the final straw that sealed the fate of the generation of
the flood was their writing a marriage contract for men to marry each other and
for humans to marry animals. Note that the Torah's statement (<i>Bresihis</i>
2:24), "<i>al kein ya'azov ish es aviv v'es imo v'dovak
b'ishot v'hayu l'basae echad</i> - therefore a man
shall leave his father and his mother and cling to his wife, and they shall
became one flesh" was directed to all of mankind. As such, the Supreme
Court decision is a direct violation of the third law which the Talmud (cited
above, <i>Chullin</i> 92b) said the nations of the world keep, i.e. having regard
and respect for the Torah.</p>

<P>Aside from shame and disappointment, how might Torah
observant Jews respond to this? Bilaam knew (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 106a) that the
G-d of Israel despises immorality, and he therefore advised Moav that the way
to attack the Jews is to entice the men of Israel to sin with Moavite women. Unfortunately
his plan had initial success.</p>

<P>In <i>Parshas Noach</i> the Torah states that all of civilization was to be destroyed since (<i>Bereishis</i> 6:12), "all
flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth". Rashi cites the Talmud (<i>Sanhedrin</i>
108a) that even the animals, beasts and birds cohabited with other species. The
Bais Halevi (in his opening comment on <i>Parshas Noach</i>) asks, it is
understood that man has free will regarding his morality, but animals
don't have free will, so how did their natural inclinations change? He
answers that the actions of man have cosmic consequences and as a result of
man's immorality the animals were perverted as well. Is it not ironic that
the rainbow flag has come to symbolize gay pride and rights! Unbeknownst to the
designer creating a flag in 1978, our holy Torah has taught us (<i>Bereishis</i>
9:15) that the rainbow is a symbol of G-d's anger towards man being held
in check by His oath not to destroy the world again after the flood; the
rainbow serves as a clear indicator that man has angered his creator.</p>

<P>This Sunday, with the fast of the seventeenth of Tammuz, we
begin the period of the three weeks which culminates in the fast of the ninth
of Av. Aside from the formal restrictions of haircuts, weddings, and live
music, this time is meant to be a period of introspection and self-scrutiny. Even
as <i>tumah</i>-impurity spreads its ugly negativity in the rest of society, <i>taharah</i>-sanctity,
purity and holiness can uplift and enhance society. Rav Pam <i>zt"l</i>
was wont to cite the Talmud (<i>Kedushin</i> 7a) that if the owner of an animal
consecrates the leg of the animal as an offering, the state of holiness
encompasses the entire animal (certainly if he consecrates a limb that is vital
to the life of the animal), and similarly we must be the holy element which
uplifts the entire society. Our response must be greater adherence to, and
appreciation for, the laws and privileged lifestyle of <i>kedushah</i>. Each and
every <i>beracha</i> must remind us "<i>asher kid'shonu b'mitzvosov</i>
- Who has sanctified us with His commandments." As even a small amount of
light can dispel a great deal of darkness, may our increase of <i>kedushah</i>
not only protect us and our families but also increase His presence in the
world.</p>

<P>After the describing passing of Avraham,<i> Parshas Chayei Sarah</i> ends with a cryptic description of the
nation Yishmael, "<i>Al pnei kol echav nafal</i> - over all his brothers
he dwelt" (<i>Bereishis</i> 25:18.) Rashi tells us the term "<i>nafal</i>
- dwelt" is interchangeable with "<i>schachein</i> - to dwell." However,
the Medrash Rabba (<i>Bereishis</i> 62:5) understands the use of "<i>nafal</i>"
here to be literal, i.e. meaning "to fall", as an indication that
after the death of Avraham the quality of Yishmael's life declined.</p>

<P>The Ba'al Haturim<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>
notes that the verse describing the falling of Yishmael is juxtaposed to the
opening verse of <i>Parshas Toldos</i> (25:19), "And these are the
offspring of Isaac", to teach that when Yishmael will fall in the end of
days then the <i>Moshiach</i>, the son of Dovid and descendant of Yitzchack,
will sprout. The Ba'al Haturim wrote this commentary approximately 700 years
ago. It not only brought comfort to the Jews of Toledo, Spain where his
illustrious father found refuge after having to flee Germany, but uplifts us
and provides encouragement today as well. The Ba'al Haturim bases his
prediction on the Yalkut Shimoni (<i>Bereishis</i> 79).</p>

<P>There will be an end of days
and the redemption will come! The prophet Isaiah (60:22) proclaims "<i>b'eita
achishena</i> - in its time I will hasten it". The Talmud (<i>Sanhedrin</i>
98a) notes the apparent contradiction in saying that the redemption will come "in
its time" and simultaneously saying "I will hasten it". The
resolution of this contradiction is taught in the name of Rav Yehoshua ben
Levi who explained <i>zachu achishena</i> - if the Jewish people are virtuous
and meritorious then He will hasten the redemption, if not it will come in its
preordained time. </p>

<P>The Talmud (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 98b)
further provides the formula for <i>achishena</i>: they asked Rav Elazar how
to mitigate and best prepare for the end of days? He responded that one should
study Torah and increase the performance of good deeds. The former is clearly
delineated in <i>Bava Basrah</i> 8a and <i>Sanhedrin</i> 99b. It is the latter
that we wish to focus on.</p>

<P>We are living in most
difficult and challenging times. The new enemy is none other than teenagers who
have been taught since kindergarten that to spill Jewish blood is noble and praiseworthy.
We feel so helpless. Thus, we not only have to increase our security, but to
really believe that our positive acts of kindness effect the Higher Realm.</p>

<P>To begin with, we are taught
daily in recitation of the second paragraph of <i>Shema</i> (<i>Devarim</i> 11:13)
that just as when man plants seeds in the ground, it yields its return and
produce, similarly, when man plants <i>mitzvos</i> and <i>ma'asim tovim</i>
they yield a Divine return and bounty.</p>

<P>In his commentary on the
verse from the <i>Shira</i>, "You led with your kindness, this nation you
redeemed" (<i>Shemos</i> 15:13) the Chofetz Chaim cites the <i>Tana D'bei
Eliyahu</i> (23) that teaches that while according to the literal understanding
the "kindness" refers to Hashem's kindness in taking us out of
Egypt, the Ravs understand the verse to refer to the many kindnesses members
of the fledgling nation did for one another in Egypt, making them worthy of
redemption. The Chofetz Chaim further teaches in his <i>Chomas Hadas</i>
(chapter 14) that when a divine decree of judgment looms over the Jewish
Nation, they must offset this decree with an abundance of <i>chessed</i>.</p>

<P>In <i>Parshas Chayei Sara</i>
we have a strange phenomenon. The Torah most often is concise and precise in
stating its laws. Most often without the oral law, one cannot decipher and
observe the written law. Yet in regards to the finding of a mate for Yitzchack
the Torah devotes sixty seven verses. Not only is this the longest chapter in
the book of <i>Bereishis</i>, but it is one of the longest chapters in the
entire Torah. What emerges and jumps out at the reader is the emphasis placed
upon <i>chessed</i> as the criteria to marry Yitzchack, as well as Rivkah's
excessive performance of <i>chessed</i>. Could she not ask Eliezer for a cup,
rather than literally pouring the water into his mouth? Could she not ask
Eliezer or one of his drivers to assist in the drinking of the ten camels? This
excessive <i>chessed</i> proves her worthiness to join the house of Avraham. In
the beginning of <i>Vayeira</i> we find Avraham's hospitality being extreme.
They were both emulating none other than Hashem Himself whose <i>chessed</i> is
constant and is beyond measure and human comprehension.</p>

<P>We must take the message to
heart. Just as Shmuel <i>Hanavi</i> admonishes King Shaul, "if you are insignificant
in your own personal assessment, you are the leader of Israel" we must
internalize that with so much assimilation and intermarriage each Torah
observant family and individual is that much more important and significant and
charged with bringing the <i>geulah</i>. Your <i>chessed</i> counts. While compared
to some others we might feel truly humble, many of us have knowledge of Judaism
that is way beyond a beginner who is searching for an introduction to Jewish
life, values, and teachings.</p>

<P>Partners in Torah is an
excellent way to spend a meaningful hour once a week talking on the phone with
an individual who could be hundreds of miles away; the closeness that develops
and the benefits are significant for both study partners. I must believe there
is a <i>Tomchei</i> Shabbos or Meals on Wheels in your community that delivers
meals to the elderly and shut-ins. If there is not one, then start one. If you
drive, find those few hours to deliver not only needed food but a smile and
companionship. Take your children or grandchildren once a month to visit a
senior citizen's residence and let them draw pictures for them and interact
with them, as this initiation can be so significant for their healthy development
and let alone the seniors.</p>

<P>Rav Chaim Volozhiner (<i>Nefesh
HaChaim</i> Gate 1 Chapter 3) teaches that Hashem created man and appointed him
to rule over the multitudes of powers and numberless worlds, to govern them via
all the minute details of his actions, speech and thoughts, whether for good or
heaven-forefend the opposite. Moreover he understands the Talmudic teaching (<i>Berachos</i>
64a) "call them your builders rather than your sons", for they
arrange the lofty worlds as a builder arranges a structure and invests it with
great strength. In chapter 7 he understands (<i>Tehillim</i> 121:5)
"Hashem <i>tzilcha</i> - Hashem is your protective shade" as "He
is your shadow" - just as a shadow's movement mirrors the movement
of the actual person or object, similarly Hashem moves the worlds based on the
movements and intentions and man's actions below.</p>

<P>In his <i>drasha</i> before <i>Selichos</i>
Rav Chaim Volozhiner interpreted the verse (<i>Devarim</i> 32:9) "<i>Yaakov
chevel nachalasecha</i>" literally, i.e. Jacob is the measure of His
inheritance. Following Rashi's interpretation of "<i>chevel</i>" as
"rope" he ingeniously interpreted the verse to mean Jacob is the rope
of His inheritance. There is, as it were, a rope descending from Heaven to the
Earth. When man moves the rope in this world it reverberates on high.</p>

<P>Finally, in response to
Moshe's request as to what answer he should give the nation when they ask who
commissioned him, Hashem says "I shall be as I shall be" (<i>Shemos</i>
3:14). The Ramban quotes the <i>Medrash Agadah</i> that Hashem was teaching the
following lesson: as the Jewish nation acts towards Him, that is the way He
reciprocates in kind. If the people open their hearts and hands and act
charitably, so will Hashem return the favor. <i>Parshas Chayei Sara</i> teaches
that our response to the excess terror in the world is excess chessed.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>We are all familiar with the <i>mitzvah</i> (<i>Sefer
Hachinuch, mitzvas aseh</i> 306) of counting the <i>omer</i>. To the Rambam
this <i>mitzvah</i> is still considered a biblical obligation while according to
the Rosh and Shulchan Aruch and others, because we do not yet have the <i>korban
omer</i> the counting nowadays is a Ravnic <i>mitzvah</i>, <i>zecher
l'mikdash</i> - a reminder as to what we had, and please G-d will have.</p>

<P>What is an Omer? The first time this term is used in the
Torah is (<i>Shemos</i> 16:16) when the <i>mon</i> descended in the desert and
Moshe conveyed the Divine instruction that each individual was to gather an <i>omer</i>
per person each day, the <i>omer</i> being an amount that satiated each person.
The last verse in that chapter informs us that an <i>omer</i> is a tenth of an <i>ephah</i>
which is the volume of approximately forty two and a half eggs (it is a dry
measure.)</p>

<P>There is a theme in the Torah that repeats itself many
times, namely, the consecration of firsts. The first born son is to be redeemed
after thirty days. The produce that grows in the land of Israel cannot be eaten
until the land owner designates the <i>terumah</i> (i.e. first) portion for the
<i>kohein</i> and to the Levi, his tenth known as <i>ma'aser</i>. Thus,
the annual bringing of an <i>omer </i>measure of barley in the Temple on the
second day of <i>Pesach</i> as an expression of appreciation to Hashem for His
giving us the barley crop is most understandable, and fits into the established
pattern. What is rather perplexing is that this offering is referred to as the <i>korban
omer</i>, as if the specific amount of barley brought played a significant role
in this offering. Moreover, the Torah uses the term <i>omer</i> three
additional times in <i>Parshas Emor</i> teaching 1) that the <i>omer</i> of
barley is to be waved on the second day of <i>Pesach</i> 2) that in addition to
the waving of the Omer a lamb is to be offered 3) that the mitzvah of counting,
bridging the two holidays of Pesach and Shavuos, is to begin on the day you
bring the Omer of waving. It seems most strange that the Torah should place
such emphasis on what appears at first glance to be a very minor detail, i.e. how
much barley (an <i>omer's</i> worth) constituted the offering.</p>

<P>Rav Yosef Salant <i>zt''l</i>, in his work
B'aer Yosef, provides a most exciting response to this question. He says
the Torah is calling attention to the <i>mon</i> by referring to the <i>korban</i>
of thanksgiving for the barley crop as a <i>korban omer</i>. How so? He notes, as
the Talmud (<i>Taanis</i> 9a) teaches, that the mun descended in merit of Moshe,
and thus it ceased on the seventh of Adar in the fortieth year which was the
day of Moshe's passing. The last portion of <i>mon</i> which the Jews
received nourished them for the thirty day period of mourning for Moshe, for three
additional days as they prepared to cross the Yardain river, and through the
fifteenth Nissan, i.e. the first day of Pesach. On the second day of Pesach
they began to eat from the produce of the land of Israel (see <i>Yehoshua</i>
5:11). It is thus understandable that to mark this transition from relying on <i>mon</i>
to eating the produce of the land of Israel we bring an <i>omer's</i>
worth of barley each year on the second day of <i>Pesach</i> in appreciation
for the many <i>omer</i> of <i>mon</i> that had nourished us throughout our
stay in the desert until the second of <i>Pesach</i> the year we entered
Israel.</p>

<P>Moreover, since it was the <i>mon</i> taught us to have
total reliance and faith in Hashem, that He is the provider of their
sustenance, now that we would be planting and harvesting and deriving our food
from the ground, and not from the sky, we could easily come to believe,
"my strength and the might of my hand made me all this wealth" (<i>Devarim</i>
8:17.) Thus, the Torah said on that this day of transition bring an <i>omer</i>
of barley to remember our daily sustenance of an <i>omer</i> of <i>mon</i>, for
ultimately there is no difference between <i>lechem min hashomayim</i> and <i>lechem
min ha-aratz</i> (bread made in heaven or that which sprouts forth from the
earth.)</p>

<P>Rav Salant quotes the <i>Medrash</i> (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i>
28:3) in which Rav Berachya taught that Hashem directed Moshe to tell <i>Bnei
Yisrael</i> that while Hashem in His generosity provided an <i>omer</i> per
person in the desert, when we reciprocate and bring an <i>omer</i> to Him, it
is but one <i>omer</i> on behalf of the entire nation, not an <i>omer</i> per
person.</p>

<P>I believe if one takes the time to calculate the discrepancy
between Hashem's generosity to us and our reciprocation, the numbers are
astounding. There were approximately two million Jews in the desert (the Torah
informs us there were six hundred thousand men between twenty and fifty, roughly
an equal number of women, and when one adds in the young and older members of
the community there must have been roughly two million Jews.) Thus, each week
Hashem "special delivered" fourteen million <i>omer</i> of <i>mon</i>
to the Jews; monthly, they received fifty six million; annually six hundred and
seventy two million; over forty years they received approximately twenty six
billion, eight hundred and eighty million portions of Omer of <i>mon</i>. And
all He asks in return is one Omer of barley! The message is so powerfully
penetrating: He gives us so much, and asks so little in return.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: kisavo]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The <i>Ashkenazik</i> practice is to begin the recitation of
<i>Selichos</i> on a <i>Motzaei Shabbos</i>, minimally four days before Rosh
Hashanah. A popular source (<i>Mishna Berurah</i> 581:6 citing Eliyahu Rabba)
for this is the fact that in conjunction with every <i>yom tov</i> the Torah
introduces the <i>korban mussaf</i> in <i>Parshas Pinchas</i> using the word
"<i>v'hikRavtem</i> - and you shall offer" the particular
additional sacrifice. In contrast, regarding Rosh Hashanah the Torah mandates (<i>Bamidbar</i>
29:2) "<i>va'aseesem</i> - and you shall make an offering",
understood by the Ravs to infer that man should make himself worthy of an offering.
As an animal in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> required a "<i>bikur mumm</i> -
physical inspection" over a period of 4 days assuring and insuring that
the animal is blemish free and fit to be offered, so too is man to introspect
and examine his ways, thoughts, and actions that they are worthy and
appropriate for the service of Hashem.</p>

<P>At first glance the particular <i>krias HaTorah</i> that is
read on the Shabbos before <i>Selichos</i> need not be related to <i>Selichos</i>.
At the same time, this year <i>Parshas Ki Tavo </i>is read and I believe that a
careful understanding of the opening <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>bikurim</i> can shed
light and enhance our appreciation of <i>Selichos</i>.</p>

<P>There are two <i>mitzvos</i> out of the 613 that deal with <i>bikurim</i>.
In <i>Mishpatim</i> (23:19) the Torah legislates the <i>mitzvah</i> of bringing
the first fruits to the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, and in <i>Ki Tavo</i> (26:5-10)
the Torah provides an exact text of a declaration, <i>mikreh bikurim</i>, that
the farmer is to recite upon presenting his first fruits to the Kohen in the <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i>. The essence of this declaration is thanksgiving to Hashem for
the produce, for the land of Israel, and for His directing history and
redeeming the enslaved Jewish nation from Egypt and bringing them to the
promised-land. Upon completion of the declaration, the farmer prostrates
himself before Hashem.</p>

<P>Dovid <i>Hamelech</i> (<i>Tehillim</i> 50:23) says, "<i>Zoveiach
todah yechabdoneni</i>" which can be understood in one of two ways. One
way is: the one who offers a thanksgiving offering honors Me. The Talmud (<i>Brachos</i>
54b) teaches that individuals that underwent challenging and dangerous
situations are obligated to bring a thanksgiving offering, including seafarers,
those who go through wildernesses, one who was ill and recovered, and one who
was incarcerated in prison and came out. Their offering, the prescribed <i>korban
todah</i>, is a recognition of Hashem's divine providence, and thereby honors
Hashem. Today, when we do not yet have the third <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, we
recite the <i>Birkat Hagomel</i> instead.</p>

<P>Rashi, however, understands the word "<i>todah</i>"
not as thanksgiving but as an admission and confession. Thus the verse is to be
understood as: the one who brings an offering of repentance and confesses his
sins is truly honoring Me. It is interesting to note that the root of the word
"<i>todah</i>" means both to admit and to offer thanks. Indeed, Rav
Hutner <i>zt"l</i> noted that the two understandings complement each
other in the <i>beracha</i> of <i>modim</i>, which is the theme of the final
section of every <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>. The Jew acknowledges and admits (as in <i>modeh
b'miktzas</i>, when one admits to part of a financial claim against him).
Here too the worshipper admits that he could not do it alone, that he needed
the assistance of other. Indeed, every time we say thank you we are first
stating that we needed something, and that we could not do it all on our own.
Subsequently having admitted this reality, the second meaning of "<i>todah</i>"
- thanks - emerges, and one expresses appreciation for the good they have
received.</p>

<P>The Torah mandates that upon completion of the recitation of
<i>mikreh bikurim</i> the farmer prostrates himself before the <i>mizbeach</i> -
the altar of Hashem. The act of <i>hachna'ah</i>, of total submission to
Hashem, follows naturally the detailed declaration of <i>hakaras hatov</i> -
thanksgiving. The more one realizes that they have been the beneficiary of His
bounty the more grateful and humbled they become and desire to reciprocate in
kind, fulfilling His every wish.</p>

<P>The <i>Talmidei</i> Hagra share, in the name of their
teacher, a related insight into the <i>Shema</i>. The opening line of <i>Shema</i>
expresses the sovereignty of Hashem, <i>Shema</i> continues to tell us to love
God with <u>ALL</u> our hearts, <u>ALL</u> our souls, and <u>ALL</u> our might.
Why the threefold repetition of "b'chol - with all"? It is
teaching us not only the existence and uniqueness of Hashem, but that <u>ALL</u>
emanates from Him. Thus our <i>hakaras hatov</i> - gratitude is directed to one
Source only, hence the three "<u>all</u>"s concretizing this idea.</p>

<P>There is an interesting difference of opinion when the ideal
time is to recite the opening <i>Selichos</i>. Rav Elyashiv <i>zt"l</i>
opined that it is best to say <i>Selichos</i> early Sunday morning. This is based
on the words of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 581:1) that the
practice is to rise early to recite <i>Selichos</i>. The very rousing of
one's self from their sleep and slumber sets the tone for acknowledging
their sins. The motivation is one of <i>todah</i> - <i>viduy</i> - admission of
guilt, i.e. not having actualized one's full potential. </p>

<P>The <i>Leket Yosher</i> (a student of the <i>Trumas Hadeshen</i>)
taught that we recite <i>Selichos</i> on Saturday night going from the joy of
Shabbos to the joy of <i>Selichos</i>. The joy of Shabbos emanates from the
spiritual effect of greater and more meaningful studying of Torah on Shabbos,
and the physical <i>oneg</i> - delight of Shabbos. The positive mood and
delight of Shabbos is the ideal prerequisite for <i>Selichos</i>. This is the <i>todah</i>
of thanksgiving leading to the <i>todah</i> of admission, namely in view of the
excessive bounty that Hashem gives each and every one of us - <i>B'ezras</i>
Hashem our health, our family, our environment, our sustenance - one realizes
that we can never sufficiently repay Him and therefore we come to <i>Selichos</i>
with a happy countenance, wanting to improve ourselves to give Him <i>nachas</i>.</p>

<P>The Medrash Rabbah explains the opening words of the Torah,
"<i>Bereishis barah Elokim</i>", to mean, "for <i>reishis </i>-
the first Hashem created" the world, and that "<i>reishis</i>"
refers to the Torah, <i>Bnai Yisroel</i> (see Rashi on the opening verse of
Torah), and <i>Bikurim</i> (which are called "reishis" in Shemos 23:19.)
Now we understand why the world was created for <i>Bikurim</i> - its
declaration of <i>hakaras hatov</i> sets the tone and foundation for man to
serve Hashem. The attitude that it's all <u>me</u> is transformed to
appreciate and recognize that everything comes from <u>Him</u>.</p>

<P>Thus, the Medrash Rabbah (<i>Bereishis</i> 22) teaches when
Adam asked Cain what occurred after his horrific act of fratricide and he said
"I did <i>teshuva</i> and was pardoned", Adam responded with
"<i>Tov l'hodos l'Hashem</i> - it is good to thank the Lord".
The Chasam Sofer cites the Medrash which explains, "<i>Tov l'hodos
l'Hashem</i>" to mean "it is good to confess and accept total
submission to Hashem". His beneficence leads to our character development.
May we be ever aware and <i>makir tov</i> of His constant showering us with
goodness and be thereby prompted to reciprocate and be worthy thereof.</p>

<P>"Aharon spoke all the words that Hashem had spoken to
Moshe; and he performed the signs in the sight of the people. And the people
believed, and they heard that Hashem had remembered the Children of Israel and
the He saw their affliction, and they bowed their heads and prostrated
themselves." (<i>Shemos</i> 4:30,31)</p>

<P>The flow of the <i>pesukim</i> would lead one to understand
that the people believed in Hashem due to their seeing the signs/miracles that
Aharon performed, i.e. the staff changing to a snake and then again back to a
staff, the leprous and healed hand, and the water of Egypt turning to blood,
caused the people to believe. The <i>Medrash</i> (<i>Shemos Rabbah</i> 5:13),
however, has a very different understanding of the <i>pesukim</i>. If indeed their
belief came as a result of the signs, it should not have said "the people
believed", but rather "the people saw", since when we
describe something as a belief we are referring to something one cannot see
tangibly with his eyes. The <i>Medrash</i> therefore teaches that they believed
in the message of Moshe, not the signs. They believed in the exact formula that
was safeguarded by Serach <i>bas</i> Asher - that the redeemer would present
the credentials of "<i>pakod yifkod</i>", that Hashem has not
forgotten you. Why, then, were the signs/miracles presented before the people?
The <i>Yefei Toar</i> on the <i>Medrash</i> suggests that it was a dress
rehearsal which was preparing Aharon for his presentation before Pharoh.</p>

<P><b><i>The powerful message of this parsha is that faith does
not only reflect the supernatural, rather it creates it.</i></b></p>

<P>The miracle of Chanukah came about only after the effort of
the Jewish Nation and their unrelenting desire to utilize pure oil to
consecrate the <i>menorah</i> caused Hashem to respond in kind. The Talmud (<i><u>Chulin</u></i>
91b) teaches that Yaakov was privileged to have his majestic dream of the ladder
only after reaching Charan and realizing his failure to pray where his
forefathers did, and began to retrace his steps; only then did he merit <i>k'fitzat
haderech</i>, the miraculous contracting of the earth on his behalf. The
daughter of Pharoh was determined to save baby Moshe, even though he was
impossibly out of reach. She stretched out her hand, and Hashem miraculously extended
it to reach Moshe. Man has to take the first step, and his belief triggers the
Divine miraculous response. While winding the strap of the <i>Tefillin shel yad</i>
around our finger like a wedding ring, we recite the <i>passuk</i>, "<i>v'eirastich
li b'emunah</i> - I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness" (<i>Hoshea</i>
2:21-22). The <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> (619) comments that we are redeemed from
exile in the merit of our <i>emunah</i>. For example, we merited Divine
inspiration and sang the <i>shirah</i> upon our deliverance at the Red Sea in
the merit of the <i>emunah</i> we displayed during that episode.</p>

<P>The <i>Chidushei Harim</i> insightfully asks "why does
the Torah introduce the <i>shirah</i> with "<i>v'yaaminu
b'Hashem</i> - they <u>believed</u> in Hashem", when in reality
they <u>saw</u> Hashem? They literally pointed with their finger and said,
"<i>zeh Keili <u>v'anveihu</u></i> - this is my God and I will
glorify Him", so where was there room for <u>belief</u>? They <u>saw/knew</u>
Hashem and were convinced of His control of nature and His mastery of the
universe by the events they witnessed! The answer lies in the juxtaposition of
"<i>v'yaaminu</i>" and "<i>az yoshir</i>". The <i>passuk</i>
should have said, "<i>az shar</i> - then they sang", in the past
tense; why does it instead say "<i>az yoshir</i>" in the future
tense? The Talmud (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 91b) teaches that this is a source in the
Torah for the belief in <i>techiyas hameisim</i> - the resurrection of
the dead, because the <i>passuk</i> is telling us that Moshe will sing again in
the future. While the Jews saw Hashem in all His might and glory at the
splitting of the Red Sea, one thing they did not see was <i>techiyas hameisim</i>.
A Jew cannot live without <i>emunah</i>, which is our constant connection to
Hashem, and thus even at a moment of great revelation like <i>krias Yam Suf</i>
we still needed to have <u>belief</u> in Hashem.</p>

<P>The first of the <i>Aseres Hadibros</i>, which explicitly includes
the belief that Hashem took us out of Egypt, is understood by the <i>Sefer
Mitzvot Katan</i> (by Rav Yaakov of Corbeil) to also include belief in Hashem
as the future redeemer; just as He redeemed us from Egypt, so will He redeem us
in the future. The requirement for our active belief is exemplified in the teaching
(<i>Sanhedrin</i> 90a) that one who does not believe in <i>techiyas hameisim</i>
will not be resurrected.</p>

<P>As we start anew <i>Sefer Shemos</i>, the book of our <i>geulah</i>/redemption,
we are not only reading about our past, but also learning how to affect the
forthcoming <i>geulah</i>. The Talmud (<i>Sotah</i> 11b) speaks of the
incredible faith of the Jewish women in Egypt, cajoling their husbands to procreate
and give rise to the next generation despite the horrific environment. Hashem
responded in kind by miraculously preserving and tending to these children.</p>

<P>Let us realize the very special times in which we are living.
If our <i>tefillos</i> are not as effective as we would like, perhaps it is
because <u>we do not really believe</u> in their efficacy and power. May our
emunah in Hashem, His Torah, His people, and His land, speedily have the meritorious
effect described by the <i>navi</i> Hoshea, just as it has in the past (<i>ma'aseh
avos siman labonim</i>).</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: yisro]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Rashi (<i>Bereishis</i> 33:20) cites the <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>
(<i>Yirmiyahu</i> 23:29) who comments that just "as a hammer that
shatters a rock", similarly do the words of Torah splinter into many
interpretations. Rashi is reminding us of the excitement found in Torah, that
it may be understood on many different levels. In light of the above, I would
like to ask what are the Ten Commandments and why the last one?</p>

<P>The <i>Panim Yafos</i> (from the author of the <i>Sefer Haflaah</i>)
presents a fascinating insight to the Ten Commandments. Commenting on the verse
in <i>Parshas Yisro</i> (19:6) "these are the words that you shall speak
to the children of Israel", Rashi says "no more and no less".
The <i>Haflaah</i> reminds us of the <i>halacha</i> (<i>Yevomos</i> 47a) that
when a potential convert comes for instruction, we teach him some <i>kalos</i> -
some of the minor, less challenging <i>mitzvos</i>, and some <i>chamuros </i>- some
of the major, more challenging <i>mitzvos</i>. He thus understands the above
Rashi as Hashem instructed Moshe to proceed slowly with <i>Bnei Yisrael</i>,
and provide a gradual initiation into Torah and <i>mitzvos</i>. (I just find it
a challenging exercise to identify which of the Ten Commandments are in the
category of minor, and which are major laws). Indeed, the Talmud (<i>Kreisus</i>
9a) learns many of the laws of conversion from the Sinaitic experience, thus
the reference of the <i>Haflaah</i> is most insightful.</p>

<P>What are the Ten Commandments? The <i>Chidushei Harim</i> (<i>Shemos</i>
6:6) interestingly connects three sets of ten <i>ma'amaros</i>, <i>makkos</i>,
and commandments. Hashem created the world with ten <i>ma'amaros</i> (statements
or pronouncements) (<i>Avos</i> 5:1). The ten <i>makkos </i>plagues, affirmed
His being the Creator, and His demonstrating His absolute control over nature. Through
the ten <i>makkos</i> the Jewish nation experienced Hashem's tender
loving care on their behalf, sparing them from any suffering and preparing them
for the acceptance of the Ten Commandments. Just as the ten <i>ma'amaros</i>
created a foundation of spirituality for physical world, the Ten Commandments was
that foundation for the Jewish nation created at Sinai.</p>

<P>What are the Ten Commandments? The Chizkuni has a novel
approach to the Ten Commandments. He notes a progression beginning with acceptance
of the absolute sovereignty of Hashem, and each subsequent <i>dibra</i> (commandment)
is an increased level of commitment towards honoring Hashem, refining
mans' character, and polishing his image of G-d in which he was created. Thus,
not only do we accept Hashem as a Creator and a Director of the world, but one
may not partner any other being or belief with Him. In addition, even His name
is treated with utmost sanctity. Moreover, we not only believe in Him, but
emulate Him by ceasing all our creativity on Shabbos, as He ceased to create.
We further honor Him as the Creator by honoring parents in their role as
creators. As man was created in the image of G-d, this belief in G-d is further
extended to the prohibition to murder. Not only may one not kill an individual,
but even to violate their soul through immorality is the next realm of
prohibition. We are further forbidden to steal, either man or his property, and
even to testify falsely. Finally, the tenth step in the realm of spiritual
perfection is <i>lo sachmod</i>, the prohibition of coveting the possessions of
the next one.</p>

<P>One can ask, how can the Torah legislate to one's
feelings and cRavings? To answer this, I would like to share the teaching of
the <i>Rakanti</i> on <i>lo sachmod</i> - not to covet. He notes that this is
not only the culmination of the Ten Commandments, but, citing (Psalms 119:86) "all
your commandments are faithful (<i>emunah</i>)", he understands that all
of the Ten Commandments and indeed our 613 mitzvos are to enhance our <i>emunah</i>
- belief in Him. If one believes that He manages and runs the world, then if my
neighbor has certain possessions and assets, it's because he needs them
to accomplish his <i>avodah </i>- his unique personalized service of Hashem. If
I don't have them, it's not that a mistake was made On High, but
those same gifts and assets might very well not be beneficial to me for my
exclusive <i>avodah</i>. Someone asked his friend how his business was, he
answered "<i>ken zein besser</i> - it could be better." The
Chofetz Chaim <i>zt"l</i> overheard the conversation and asked,
"how do you know?" </p>

<P>Thus, the <i>Rakanti</i> helps us attain the progression of
the <i>Chizkuni</i>. By appreciating and accepting the first step, namely His
existence and involvement in every aspect of our lives, we can more understand
and accept the tenth step of not coveting.</p>

<P>The Talmud (<i>Yuma</i> 38b) teaches that each individual is
destined to receive exactly what they need and what is coming to them; one does
not take from another, even a "hairs-breath". Moreover, the Talmud (<i>Sotah</i>
9a) teaches that if one is jealous of the next one's possession, not only
does he not get the object of his desire but oftentimes, tragically, because he
did not appreciate what he did have, will lose that too.</p>

<P>Finally, I believe <i>lo sachmod</i> is a recipe for healthy
living. "Who is the rich one?", we are taught in <i>Avos</i> (4:1),
"the <i>someiach b'chelko</i>." This is usually translated as
the one happy and satisfied with his lot. True! I would like to suggest in
addition, the one who is happy with what the next one has! The realization that
I have what I need, and if I don't have it, it is because He knows that I
don't need it, and it's best for me this way, keeps one out of the
rat-race of life, enabling one to truly enjoy both this world and the next.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The <i>kri'as haTorah</i> for <i>acharon shel Pesach</i>
is the <i>parsha</i> of the <i>moadim</i> found in <i>Parshas Re'eh</i>. In the
last verse speaking about <i>Pesach</i> (16:8) the Torah teaches "...and
on the seventh day shall be an assembly (<i>atzeres</i>) to Hashem, Your G-d,
you shall not perform labor." Interestingly, the Torah does not provide us
with a reason for this day being designated as a <i>yom tov</i>. Rav Hirsch
understands the <i>atzeres</i> gathering as a gathering together of ideas and a
type of recapitulation of the lessons and concepts that the <i>yom tov</i> provided
for us. Seforno understands this day as a commemoration of the <i>shirah</i> - song
that the Jewish nation sang upon its deliverance, hence the day was consecrated
as a <i>yom tov</i>. Thus the very character of this day may be defined by the <i>shirah</i>.</p>

<P>The <i>yom tov</i> of <i>Pesach</i> is permeated with <i>hakoras
hatov</i> - thanksgiving and recognition of the kindnesses that Hashem
performed on our behalf. The <i>Seder</i> is replete with <i>hakoras hatov</i>;
we fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>sippur yetzi'as Mitzraim</i> by citing
and explaining the four verses from the declaration of thanksgiving that the
Jewish farmer recited upon bringing his first fruits to the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>.
Furthermore, our meal is eaten between the first two paragraphs of <i>Hallel</i>
and its conclusion, to demonstrate that the meal itself is a <i>seudas hodaya</i>
- a meal of thanksgiving.</p>

<P>Indeed, there are many lessons of <i>hakoras hatov</i> that
emerge from the narrative in <i>Shemos</i>. Moshe is told not to strike neither
the water to bring about the plagues of blood and frogs, nor the earth to
commence <i>kinim</i> - lice, and thus the important lesson of gratitude,
even to the inanimate, was emphasized. Even prior to the <i>makos</i>, when
Moshe finally acquiesces and agrees to assume the mantle of leadership to be
the emissary of Hashem to Pharaoh and the Jewish people, prior to going to
Egypt Moshe asks permission from Yisro to leave, even though Moshe is almost
eighty years old and even though it will delay his mission, because Yisro
afforded him hospitality and he had to show <i>hakoras hatov</i>. Moreover, <i>hakoras
hatov</i> is extended to the dogs (see <i>Shemos</i> 22:30) in appreciation of
their having remained silent from barking on the night of <i>makos bechoros</i>,
thereby creating a greater distinction between the crying and wailing in the
Egyptian communities and the total silence in the Jewish sector.</p>

<P><i>Hakoras Hatov</i> is such a crucial element of human
decency that the Torah prohibits us from marrying an Amonite or Moavite, even
if they convert to Judaism, for all time because they did not extend any help,
even bread and water, to the fledgling Jewish nation upon its leaving Egypt. They
should have felt a debt of gratitude to us since our grandfather Avrohom saved
their grandfather Lot, and yet they did not return the kindness (<i>Devorim</i>
23:5) and thus are forever banned from marrying into the Jewish people. Rav
Chaim Friedlander <i>zt"l</i> notes (<i>Sifsei Chayim</i> Volume 2, Page
278) that the Jewish people were being nourished miraculously by the <i>mon</i>
and the <i>be'er</i> of Miriam, and therefore we did not actually need any help
from Amon and Moav; rather it was they who needed to extend basic goodness and
kindness in order to show appreciation, but failed to do so. Hashem, who is not
only our Liberator but our loving Father and Teacher, says regarding <i>yetzi'as
Mitzrayim</i>, "Today you are leaving in the month of spring" (<i>Shemos</i>
13:4). Rashi explains that Hashem was not telling them the time, rather He was
noting that they should see the kindness that He bestowed upon them by taking them
out during the most comfortable season of the year.</p>

<P>I believe that <i>shevi'i shel Pesach</i>, complete
with the singing of <i>shirah</i>, brings us to a newer, higher, pinnacle of <i>hakoras
hatov</i>. At first glance the essence of the <i>Shirah</i> is thanking Hashem
for saving us from the danger of the Egyptians who were seeking to either kill
us or return us to Egypt for further bondage. However, the Beis Halevi teaches that
core idea of the <i>shirah</i> is found in its very last <i>passuk</i> (15:19),
"When Pharoh's horse came with his chariots and horsemen into the sea and
Hashem turned back the waters of the sea upon them, the children of Israel
walked in the dry land amid the sea." The prior eighteen verses are all
extolling Hashem as the incredible warrior who, with such precision, is able to
simultaneously punish each Egyptian in accordance with the level of punishment
that they deserved (See Rashi 15:5). The <i>hakoras hatov</i> of the <i>shirah</i>
is understood by the Beis Halevi as one of thanksgiving to Hashem for using <i>Bnei
Yisrael</i> as the vehicle through whom a magnificent <i>kiddush</i> Hashem
occurred. Hashem changed the natural order, transforming water into dry land on
behalf of <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> and the entire world, without the benefit of modern
communications, knew of the miraculous splitting of the Red Sea. Rachav (Yehoshua
2:10) tells the spies Yehoshua sent that, "we have heard how Hashem dried
up the water of the Sea of Reeds." This is even a higher and more profound
form of <i>hakoras hatov</i>; it is not only thanksgiving for a physical
deliverance but for spiritually elevating former slaves by allowing them to
participate in bringing about honor and splendor to the King. <i>Yetzi'as
Mitzrayim</i> connotes not only our transformation from slaves to free men, but
from slaves to aristocracy. I believe this very special designation came about
at <i>Kri'as Yam</i> Suf.</p>

<P>The Seforno explains the possuk, "...that is this night
unto Hashem guardings for all the children of Israel for their generations"
(<i>Shemos</i> 12:42) to indicate that just as Hashem anticipated anxiously the
night of redemption in Egypt, so too, He anxiously yearns for our redemption in
the future. Moreover, the Navi (Micha 7:15) prophesies that just as Hashem
showed wonders to the Jewish nation upon our deliverance from Egypt, so will He
in the future. Our prayer as we enter the last days of this holiday is for
Hashem to once again redeem us and use us, His children, as the vehicle of
educating the entire world about His existence and His magnificence.</p>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Daniel Stein]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2016]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: korach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Even after the Earth itself opened its mouth and devoured Korach
and his family (<i>Bamidbar</i> 16), the nation was not entirely convinced that
Moshe and Aharon were their true leaders. It wasn't until a second
miracle occurred (<i>Bamidbar</i> 17), when the staff of Aharon was the only staff
to blossom and produce almonds, that everyone became confident that Korach was indeed
wrong. Rav Leibel Eiger (<i>Toras Emes</i>) asks, why was the second miracle,
which was blatantly less dramatic and extreme than the first, so much more
compelling and persuasive? He explains that what is most effective in influencing
and inspiring people to improve is not when they are intimidated by the looming
threat of terrifying punishments, but rather when they see the fruits and the
benefits that lay instore, when they see the almonds. It is only when they
recognize that it is in their own best interests to listen and to change, when
they see that they are the ones who have something to gain, that people are
most likely to act.</p>

<P>Perhaps this idea was in fact first taught to us at the time
of the creation of the world, when Hashem declared to his ministering angels
"let us create man" (<i>Breishis</i> 1:26). Rashi explains that the
<i>pasuk</i> is in the plural, "let us", because <i>Hakadosh Baruch
Hu</i> included the angels in the decision making process before creating man.
This is not because Hashem needed the permission or assistance of the angels, <i>chas
v'shalom</i>, but rather it was in order to instruct us to consult with
our subordinates before making decisions instead of unilaterally imposing
edicts upon them. Rav Wolbe (<i>Shiurei Chumash</i>) explains that this is not
only proper <i>derech</i> <i>eretz</i> and <i>middas anavah</i>, but it is also
the most effective tool in rallying the support of others. Only when one
includes others in the decision making process can they have the ability to
understand why a certain course of action was chosen, and why that course of
action is ultimately for the greater good. That in turn is the best way to
secure their support and collaboration moving forward.</p>

<P>The <i>Nesivos Sholom</i> claims that this is critical when disciplining
young <i>talmidim</i> in the classroom as well. He compares the process of
maintaining classroom decorum to a lumberjack attempting to clear a forest. He
can begin chopping one tree at a time, but by the time he is done cutting down
one tree, three more will have sprouted in its place. The better strategy would
be to light a fire in the forest and burn down the trees of the forest all at
once. Similarly, a <i>rebbe</i> or teacher can discipline each individual
child, but they risk abandoning the other students in the process and the
classroom can precipitously spiral out of control. However, if the <i>rebbe</i>
can successfully light a "fire" of excitement within the <i>talmidim</i>
and genuinely "ignite" their interest in what they are learning,
the classroom can be more easily controlled. At that point the <i>talmidim</i>
will behave and pay attention not because they are being told to do so, but
because they want to, because they have come to realize that they are the ones
who have something to gain.</p>

<P>This perspective defines our very relationship with <i>avodas</i>
Hashem and <i>shmiras hamitzvos</i> in general. At the end of <i>Parshas</i> <i>Shelach</i>
(<i>Bamidbar</i> 15:40) the Torah juxtaposes the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>tzitzis</i>
with the prohibition of <i>avodah zara</i> and the <i>mitzvah</i> of Shabbos.
Rashi explains that this is because, just as <i>chilul shabbos</i> and
worshiping <i>avodah zarah</i> are tantamount to violating the entire Torah, so
too, one who performs the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>tzizis</i> is considered as if
he has fulfilled all of the <i>mitzvos</i> of the Torah. This is further
reflected by the fact that the <i>gematria</i> of <i>tzitzis</i> is 600, which
together with the 8 strings and 5 knots on each corner, adds up to 613. However,
if wearing <i>tzitzis</i> is in fact so central and fundamental, why is one
only obligated in the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>tzitzis</i> if he first chooses to
wear a four cornered garment? Why is wearing a four cornered garment in the
first place not mandatory (see <i>Menachos</i> 41a)? Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Darash</i>
<i>Moshe</i>) explains that since the mitzvah of <i>tzitzis</i> corresponds to all
of the <i>mitzvos</i> of the Torah, in a certain sense it represents our entire
relationship with Hashem. Having a relationship with Hashem can't be
compulsory or forced, it has to be something that we chose, that we want,
because we recognize that it is we who stand to benefit from that relationship
the most.</p>

<P>The <i>gemara</i> (<i>Shabbos</i> 88a) tells us that when <i>Klal</i>
<i>Yisrael</i> proclaimed "<i>naaseh ve'nishmah</i> - we will do
and then we will hear", at the time of <i>kabbalas</i> <i>haTorah</i>, a
heavenly voice responded and exclaimed, "<i>mi gila le'banai roz
zeh</i> - who has revealed this <u>secret</u> to my children?" The <i>gemara</i>
does not elaborate any further on the nature of the secret of "<i>naaseh</i>
<i>ve'nishmah</i>", or justify why it is a secret in the first
place. The <i>Me'or Vashemesh</i> explains in light of the only
"secret" mentioned by the Rambam in all of his <i>Mishnah Torah</i>:
the Rambam writes (<i>Hilchos</i> <i>Teshuvah</i> 10:5) that when first
initiating a child to Torah and <i>mitzvos</i>, they should be motivated to
perform the <i>mitzvos</i> out of fear of punishment and the prospect of
reward. However, as they mature and develop, slowly and cautiously, "<i>megalim
lahem roz zeh</i> - we reveal to them this <u>secret.</u>" Namely, that
the ideal form of worshiping Hashem is when it is done out of love not fear,
because we want to not because we have to. Similarly, the manner of <i>avodas</i>
Hashem implied by "<i>naaseh</i> <i>ve'nishmah</i>",
performance before command, is a commitment spawned out of love not fear.
However, since universal adherence to the Torah and <i>mitzvos</i> must be
uncompromising and unwavering, this notion can't be shared prematurely
and indiscriminately. Nonetheless, to have a mature, healthy, and enduring
relationship with <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i>, we must at some point and on some
level learn to perform the <i>mitzvos</i> out of love. Not just because we have
to but because we want to, because we recognize that is for our own benefit and
that we are the ones who stand to gain.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>"Perhaps there is amongst you a man,
woman, family, or tribe, whose heart strays this day from Hashem, our God, to
go and worship the deities of those nations. Perhaps there is among you a root
that produces hemlock and wormwood" (<i>Devarim</i> 29, 17). The Torah
juxtaposes in the very same <i>pasuk</i> two individuals who ostensibly seem vastly
different from one another. The first has strayed entirely from the ways of the
Torah and embraced idol worship whole heartedly. The second merely has an eroded
and infected "root." The <i>Ramban</i> explains that this second
individual is presently committed to the <i>mitzvos</i> and <i>avodas</i>
Hashem, but in the deep recesses of his heart there lies a kernel of doubt and insubordination.
However, currently they are at opposite ends of the spectrum. The first individual
in the <i>pasuk</i> has already abandoned <i>yiddeshkeit</i> completely while
the second is a practicing, loyal, and faithful Jew. Why are these two people
grouped together? What do they share in common?</p>

<P>Rav Henoch Leibowitz (<i>Majesty of Man</i>),
explains that even though presently there might be a great distance between
these two individuals, they are both on the same path, bearing an identical
trajectory; one might be further down the road than the other, but ultimately
they will be united. The Torah is alluding to us that a critical component of
our <i>teshuvah</i> process is not only evaluating our previous actions and
assessing our current status, but also taking time to consider the path we are
on and the direction in which we are heading, because inevitably that will
determine our destination. Rav Elya Meir Bloch was once standing with his <i>talmidim</i>
on a Chicago train station platform waiting for the Pacemaker to New York. A
few feet away, on the other side of the platform stood the Sunshine Express to
San Francisco. He asked his <i>talmidim</i>, "How far apart are these two
trains?" They hastily conjectured that they were separated by about eight
to ten feet. Rav Bloch disagreed, "The two trains are 3,000 miles apart,
because one is headed to California, and the other to New York."</p>

<P>This is arguably the unique message of <i>Parshas
Nitzavim</i>. <i>Parshas</i> <i>Nitzavim</i> seems to embody a very similar
theme to that of <i>Parshas</i> <i>Ki</i> <i>Savo</i>. Both <i>parshiyos</i>
convey and underscore the centrality of our covenant - <i>bris</i> with Hashem.
They both describe how if we will perform the <i>mitzvos</i> we will be
rewarded, and if not we will be punished. However, the <i>Netziv</i> (<i>Haamek
Davar</i>) notices a fundamental difference between the two presentations. <i>Parshas
Ki Savo</i> focuses primarily on actions, on two possible modes of conduct;
either "If you will listen to the voice of Hashem your God, to keep and
perform all of His commandments" (28:1) or "If you will not listen
to the voice of Hashem your God to keep and perform all of His
commandments" (28:15). The lesson of <i>Parshas</i> <i>Ki</i> <i>Savo</i>
corresponds to the aspect of <i>teshuvah</i> which demands that we examine our
previous actions and identify areas where we can improve.</p>

<P>However, <i>Parshas Nitzavim</i> adds an
additional element, another dimension to the covenant, namely that of loving
Hashem. As the <i>pesukim</i> state: "I have commanded you this day to <u>love</u>
Hashem your God to follow His ways and keep His commandments" (30:16), "To
<u>love</u> Hashem your God, to listen to His voice and to cleave to Him"
(30:20), and "Hashem will circumcise your <u>heart</u> and the <u>hearts</u>
of your children to <u>love</u> Hashem your God" (30:6). The <i>Netziv</i>
explains that the Torah is teaching us in <i>Parshas</i> <i>Nitzavim</i> that adherence
to the <i>mitzvos</i> is not enough, because if our core commitment to the
mission is weak and waning, if our hearts are lacking in love of Hashem, we
will be trending off course and ultimately religious decay will undoubtedly
ensue. As the <i>pasuk</i> states, "If your <u>heart</u> turns away and
does not listen, you <b><u>will</u></b> be drawn away and bow down to other
gods and serve them" (30:17). Genuine <i>teshuvah</i> demands not only
that we evaluate our deeds, but our direction, because if we are headed down
the wrong path, the results can be catastrophic.</p>

<P>The <i>Rambam</i> (<i>Hilchos Teshuvah</i>
3:3) writes, "the sins of every inhabitant of the world together with his
merits are weighed on the festival of Rosh Hashanah.
If one is found righteous, he is sealed for life, if one is found wicked, he is
sealed for death. A <i>beinoni</i>, one who is in between, his verdict remains
tentative until Yom Kippur. If he repents, he
is sealed for life, if not, he is sealed for death."</p>

<P>The <i>Lechem</i> <i>Mishnah</i> questions
why the <i>beinoni</i> must specifically repent and perform the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>teshuvah</i> in order to receive a positive judgment on Yom Kippur; after
all, once he performs any <i>mitzvah</i> that should tilt the scales in his
favor. He explains (and this is elaborated upon by Rav Yitzchak Blazer in his <i>Kochvei
Ohr</i>) that the greatest of all sins is squandering the opportunity for
change and <i>teshuvah</i>. Therefore, any positive act that is performed by
the <i>beinoni</i> will be eclipsed and outweighed by his failure to repent and
perform <i>teshuvah</i>. Alternatively, Rav Aryeh Pomeranchek (<i>Emek Bracha</i>),
Rav Chaim Shmulevitz (<i>Sichas Mussar</i>), and Rav Ahron Kotler (<i>Mishnas
Rebbe Ahron</i>) suggest that the performance of any additional <i>mitzvah</i> will
accrue towards the following year, and therefore will be ineffective in
altering the previous year's tally. Only the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>teshuvah</i>
has the power to change the past, to rewrite history, and thereby favorably skew
the judgement of the previous year.</p>

<P>However, the <i>Meiri</i> (<i>Chibur Hateshuvah</i>),
and later Rav Yitzchak Hutner (<i>Pachad Yitzchak</i>), suggest that the <i>Rambam</i>
does not view the <i>beinoni</i> as one who is literally caught in the limbo of
a formal numerical stalemate between <i>mitzvos</i> and <i>aveiros</i>. For if
that were the case, it would presumably be an exceedingly rare occurrence, yet
the <i>Rambam</i> (<i>Hilchos Teshuvah</i> 3:4) exhorts us all to view
ourselves as <i>beinonim</i> throughout the ten days of repentance and beyond. Rather
the <i>Rambam</i> understands the judgment of Rosh Hashanah to be a function not
only of our past performance but also of our direction for the future. Therefore,
the <i>beinoni</i> represents all those who are wavering or feel conflicted about
their religious arc and trajectory. Are we progressing closer towards Hashem or
drifting further away? Is our religious commitment intensifying or subsiding? The
only <i>mitzvah</i> which can effectively address and impact this aspect of our
lives is the introspective soul bearing process of <i>teshuvah</i>, and that is
why <i>teshuvah</i> is the only avenue available to the <i>beinoni</i>.</p>

<p>As we stand at the doorstep of Rosh Hashanah
and the <i>Aseres Yemei Teshuvah</i> we must undertake, individually and
collectively, not only to assess the validity of our actions, but also to inspect
what lies within our hearts, and honestly ask ourselves, "Where are we
headed?" Concerns regarding trajectory and direction should be welcomed
and embraced as the indispensable hallmark of authentic <i>avodas</i> Hashem.
We are enjoined to respond to the message of <i>Parshas Ki Savo</i> as well as the
call of <i>Parshas Nitzavim</i>. We are obliged not only to recommit ourselves
to a scrupulous observance of all of the <i>mitzvos</i>, but to reinvest in an
honest and unadulterated love of Hashem, and to chart a course for the future
based solely on that agenda. May we all be <i>zoche</i> to be successful in
this endeavor, and merit as individuals and as a community to have a <i>kesivah</i>
<i>vechasima</i> <i>tovah</i> and a <i>gut</i> <i>gebentched</i> <i>yor</i>!</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Eisav decided to sell his birthright to Yaakov because he reasoned, "behold, I
am going to die, so why do I need this birthright?" (<i>Bereishis</i> 25:32).
<i>Rashi</i> writes that before relinquishing the birthright, Eisav initially
questioned Yaakov regarding the nature of the responsibilities and the <i>avodah</i>
service that would be incumbent upon him as the first born. Yaakov explained to
him, "there are many prohibitions, punishments, even punishments by death
that are involved with it," leading Eisav to conclude, "I will
eventually die as a result of my birthright, if so, why should I desire
it." Therefore, Eisav chose to trade away the birthright rather than risk
suffering his possible demise as a result of a flawed performance. However, the
Torah closes the discussion by stating that Eisav offended the birthright by
trading it away, as the <i>pasuk</i> says "And Yaakov gave Eisav bread
and a pottage of lentils, and he ate and drank and arose and left, and Eisav
disparaged the birthright" (25:34).</p>

<P>Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Darash Moshe</i>) asks, how did Eisav disparage the
birthright by abdicating and being unwilling to serve? He was understandably
afraid of the gRave consequences of not being able to adequately discharge this
sacred duty. Rav Moshe explains that Eisav was not motivated primarily by a fear
of the penalties he might incur, but rather by an aversion to assuming the
responsibilities of the post in the first place. In that sense, Eisav's visceral
reaction, to recoil and retreat in the face of this hallowed responsibility, was
itself a tacit insult to the very institution. His refusal to assume this obligation
and responsibility revealed a fundamental lack of appreciation for the cosmic
significance of representing humanity in serving Hashem.</p>

<P>It emerges that one of the principle differences between Eisav and Yaakov was in their
attitude towards accepting responsibility, or <i>achrayus</i>, for others. While
Eisav was busy fleeing from the burden of representing others in serving
Hashem, Yaakov was bargaining for more. Perhaps this was not only because
Yaakov had a greater understanding of the significance of serving Hashem, but
also because he recognized that accepting <i>achrayus</i>, responsibility for
others, is a transformative undertaking which endows one with the strength and
capabilities necessary to succeed despite the risks and dangers involved.
Yaakov knew that assuming responsibility for others itself engenders and breeds
success, making failure no longer a concern.</p>

<P>Perhaps we find this notion expressed most poignantly with regards to Yehoshua <i>ben</i>
Gamla. The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Yoma</i> 18a) records that, regrettably, during
the period of the second <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> the selection process to fill
the position of <i>kohein gadol</i> had been corrupted. Instead of appointing
the worthiest candidate, the position was often awarded to the highest bidder.
The <i>Gemara</i> continues that the most egregious and disgraceful example of
an undeserving layman who unceremoniously purchased the position of <i>kohen</i>
<i>gadol</i>, was Yehoshua <i>ben</i> Gamla who acquired the position from
Yannai the King. However, the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Bava Basra</i> 21a) elsewhere
presents us with an entirely different narrative regarding the identity and
personality of Yehoshua <i>ben</i> Gamla. The <i>Gemara</i> ascribes the
establishment of the entire system of <i>yeshivos</i> and Jewish schooling to
the efforts and initiative of Yehoshua <i>ben</i> Gamla. How could the same individual
who epitomized religious corruption also be the seminal figure accredited with the
perpetuation of Torah learning in <i>Klal</i> <i>Yisrael</i>?</p>

<P>In fact, this tension and apparent inconsistency in the chronicling of the
activities of Yehoshua <i>ben</i> Gamla led the <i>Ritva</i> to conclude that there
were two different individuals, both coincidentally bearing the name Yehoshua <i>ben</i>
Gamla. However, the <i>Sfas Emes</i> explains that in fact they were one in the
same. Even though prior to his appointment Yehoshua <i>ben</i> Gamla was
nothing more than a fraudulent ignoramus, upon being appointed as <i>kohein</i>
<i>gadol</i> a personal transformation occurred. The yolk of responsibility for
others and for the nation awakened within Yehoshua <i>ben</i> Gamla reservoirs
of untapped potential enabling him to become a champion of the <i>mesorah</i>
and a visionary hero in the annals of Jewish history.</p>

<P>Similarly, in <i>Parshas Mikeitz</i>, the Torah tells us that Yaakov was initially reluctant
to send Binyamin down to <i>Mitzrayim</i> with the other <i>shevatim</i> because
tRavelling was inherently dangerous and "lest misfortune befall him"
(<i>Breishis</i> 42:4) along the way. Even after Shimon was taken captive and
Yosef demanded to have an audience with Binyamin, Yaakov remained steadfast in
his refusal to allow Binyamin to go. It wasn't until Yehudah accepted
responsibility for Binyamin <a name=v9></a>when he stated "I will
guarantee him; from my hand you can demand him. If I do not bring him to you
and stand him up before you, I will have sinned against you forever" (43:9)
that Yaakov finally relented. What changed when Yehudah accepted <i>achrayus</i>,
responsibility for Binyamin? TRavelling was still perilous and an accidental
tragedy could still occur. Why did Yaakov change his mind and allow Binyamin to
go?</p>

<P>The <i>Shem Mishmuel</i> explains that Yaakov was afraid that in the absence of an
absolute responsibility and obligation to succeed, any impediment or difficulty
experienced by the <i>shevatim</i> in securing Binyamin's safety could be
confused with an "accident". When we enjoy impunity to attribute
our failures to circumstances beyond our control, failure becomes all the more
likely. However, when Yehudah accepted the <i>achrayus</i>, that under all
circumstances he would be held accountable for ensuring Binyamin's wellbeing,
Yaakov knew that the very obligation and responsibility to succeed would
transform Yehudah and endow him with the resolve and the strength necessary to
ultimately be successful.</p>

<P>In our own lives, we should seek to emulate the example of Yaakov <i>Avinu</i>. We
should eagerly undertake additional responsibility for others, in each of the
three primary realms of <i>Torah</i>, <i>avodah</i>, and <i>chesed</i>. Only in
that way will we be able to discover and achieve our individual potential and
collectively realize our national destiny. By virtue of a Divine command as
well as a historical imperative, we have an obligation to succeed, and we can
only attain our goal by joining together and realizing our mutual
responsibility to <i>avodas</i> <i>Hashem</i> and to each other. In other
words, to fulfill our responsibility to succeed we must take responsibility for
one another.</p>

<P>Rav Ephraim Shapiro from Miami Beach once explained that the letters of the Hebrew
word for taking responsibility for others, <i>achrayus</i>, - <i>aleph</i>, <i>ches</i>,
<i>reish</i>, <i>yud</i>, <i>vuv</i>, and <i>tuf</i> - instruct us in the
proper progression we should follow in assuming responsibility for one another.
The first letter is an <i>aleph</i> representing the number one and the notion
that before looking to help others, we must first make sure that we have taken responsibility
for our own actions and needs. The following letter is <i>ches</i> which
together with <i>aleph</i> spells the word <i>ach </i>or "brother".
Only after we been successful in taking care of ourselves can we begin to take
responsibility for our brothers, families, and relatives. The next letter is <i>reish</i>,
which together with the first two letters spells <i>acheir</i>, or
"other". Once our families are secure we can use that stability as
a platform to aid and help others as well. The following letter is <i>yud</i>,
which turns the word <i>acheir</i> in to <i>acharai </i>or "behind
me" or "follow me", because one who takes responsibility for
others becomes a natural role model and leader within the community. The next
letter is <i>vuv </i>which added to the previous letters changes <i>acharai</i>
to <i>achaRav</i> or "after him", since a role model who takes
responsibility for others will inspire people to follow their example. Finally,
the letter <i>tuf</i>, because <i>achrayus</i> begins with <i>aleph</i>, the
first letter in the alphabet, and ends with <i>tuf</i>, the last letter in the
alphabet. This symbolizes that taking responsibility for others should occupy
us constantly, and that it has the ability to embolden, enrich, and uplift
every aspect of our lives all the way from <i>aleph</i> to <i>tuf</i>!</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: noach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Reb Chaim Volozhiner in his <i>Nefesh</i><i> Hachaim</i>
(chapter 5) extols the potential of man. He cites the verse (<i>Devarim</i> 32:9) "for Hashem's portion is His
people, Jacob is the measure of His inheritance". The noun in the verse is
<i>chevel</i> which literally means a rope. Rashi understands the rope to consist of three
strands, namely the merits of the three patriarchs. <i>Nefesh</i><i>
Hachaim</i> understands the rope to be suspended from
heaven to Earth. When man tugs and pulls the rope in this world, it has consequences
in the upper realms.</p>

<P>This is demonstrated in where Reb Chanina
bar Pada's teaching (<i>Brachos</i>
35b) that if one eats without reciting the proper <i>bracha</i> he is stealing from Hashem
and from the Jewish people. That he is stealing from Hashem is understood, as
he is failing to proclaim His sovereignty over the world. In addition, he is
stealing from the people of Israel because, Rashi explains, when man sins (as
in the case of eating without a blessing) the fruit, its taste, and nutritional
value become diminished. Such is the powerful impact of man on his natural
environment.</p>

<P>It is most fascinating to note the relationship between man
and his natural world. Interestingly, when man eats from the forbidden fruit,
and then realizes he is naked, he covers himself with fig leaves. Rashi (<i>Breishis</i> 3:7 citing <i>Brachos</i>
40a) teaches that the fig tree is the tree from which he ate and from the very
object of his sin came the remedy, i.e. his clothing. However, the other trees
refused to allow him to take their leaves. Prior to his sin all of nature, man
and the natural world around him, were in perfect sync and harmony, proudly
unified in bringing honor and glory to Hashem. When man sinned it was an
affront to all of nature, not just to man. His sinning brought about a negative
change in the environment.</p>

<P>When Cain killed Hevel and was
punished to be a wanderer, Cain protests to Hashem and cries out, (<i>Breishis</i> 4:14) "whoever meets me will kill
me". Who is Cain afraid of being killed by? The only other humans around
are his parents, and although they will be angry at him it is most unlikely
that they will kill him! The Ramban therefore answers
that Cain feared being killed by the animals, since he broke the peaceful
nature of the natural world, he understood that now the animals would also turn
violent and kill him. There is an ideal balance in the natural world with man.</p>

<P>One may suggest it all started when Hashem declared on the
sixth day of creation (<i>Breishis</i> 1:28), "<i>na'aseh</i><i> adam</i> - let <u>us</u>
make man." Rashi explains the challenging "<u>us</u>" as
referring to the angels with whom Hashem consulted prior to making man. The
Zohar (<i>Pinchas</i> 219) understands this to mean
that Hashem was addressing all of creation and said, "I will take
something from everything, from all the animals, all the different
characteristics and together form man as a composite of all of nature."</p>

<P>I believe this can help us understand Yehuda ben Teima's statement (<i>Avos</i>
5:23), "be bold as a leopard, light as an eagle, swift as a deer, and
bRave as a lion, to perform the will of your Father in Heaven". Why does he
need to associate each trait with an animal? Why not simply say be swift, bold,
and strong? Perhaps he is reminding us that we can do it, since part of the
strength of the animals is in each of us.</p>

<P>In the beginning of <i>Parshas Noach</i> (Breishis 6:12) mankind
is given a humiliating blow by being referred to as "meat" when Hashem
announces, "for all flesh has corrupted its way
upon the earth". This most demeaning referral is repeated again in (6:17).
Rashi, citing (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 108a) teaches that even the beasts, animals and
birds were acting in an immoral way, mating outside their own species. How can
this be? After all, the animals have their own natural order and do not have a <i>yetzer harah</i> - evil
inclination!</p>

<P>The Beis Halevi
in his opening discourse on <i>Parshas</i><i> Noach</i> teaches that man's actions have global
consequences. His actions not only effect himself, his neighbors, and his
immediate environment, but have a ripple effect upon the entire world. This is
further substantiated by the <i>Nefesh</i><i> Hachaim</i> (chapter 3) who cites several teachings of our
Ravs including the Talmud's (<i>Brachos</i> 64a)
famous comment, "'and all your children will be students of Hashem,
and your children will have peace'(Isaiah 54:13) Do not understand only 'your
children', but as 'your builders'". Reb Chaim
understands this to mean that man's actions either build or destroy the world.
Since all of creation is centered within man, when man degrades himself it is reflected
by, and has reverberations in, the natural world.</p>

<P>As we said earlier, in <i>Parshas Noach</i> man is referred to as <i>basar</i>-meat. The greatness of
Avraham is the, "<i>nefesh Asher asu B'Charan</i> - the souls they made in Charan" (Bereshis 12:5.)
Rashi (citing <i>Sanhedrin</i> 99b) explains that Avraham converted the men and
Sarah the women. We don't find anywhere, however, these "converts"
acceptance of Torah and <i >mitzvos</i>,
so what type of conversion was this? Perhaps, as Rav Amiel <I>z"l</I>i> in his <i>Hegyonos</i><i> el Ami</i> suggests, Avraham and Sarah
taught mankind that man is not to be viewed as <i
>basar</i>-meat, but as <i >nefesh</i> - a spiritual being. He has the ability, by uniting his body and soul, to bring
about harmony in nature. Marriage is, as Avraham said to Sarah, "and that
my soul may live on account of you" (<i>Bereishis</i> 12:13), i.e. the uniting of two individuals in sanctity, bringing harmony in
the home and thus by extension to the rest of creation.</p>

<P>Much of our woes are attributed to global warming. I believe
if man would only look inward and take responsibility for the immorality of our
society, for the breakdown of the sacred family structure, it would do more to
restore the balance of nature and man. We all yearn for the days of (Isaiah 11:6),
"a wolf will dwell with a sheep". The Torah provides us with a path
to reach that state: restore the harmony and balance in nature, and be moral.</p>

<P>As we take leave of the completed <i>Mishkan</i> built by
the Jewish people in the desert, "all the work of the Tabernacle, the Tent
of Meeting, was completed" (<i>Shemos</i> 39:32), I'd like to look at a significant
aspect of the <i>Mishkan</i> not necessarily visible at first glance. Among the
obvious questions regarding His home is: why is it composed of earthly
materials, gold, silver, and copper, when He could have made it from Divine
materials? After all, the first set of <i>luchos</i>, those broken by Moshe,
were "heavenly made", "stone tablets inscribed by the finger of
G-d" (<i>Shemos</i> 31:18). The manna which nourished the Jewish nation
for 40 years, was literally food from Heaven - "I shall rain down for you
food from Heaven"(<i>Shemos</i> 16:4.) Why then, asks the Dubner <i>Maggid</i>
(<i>Ohel Yaakov</i>, opening essay on <i>Terumah</i>), did Hashem not construct
a more fitting holy abode for the Divine Presence in this world?</p>

<P>The <i>Maggid</i> answers that Hashem wants to build His
Sanctuary with the love of the Jewish people. King Shlomo describes the special
House of G-d as, "<i>tocho ratzuf ahava</i> - its foundation is paved in with
love" (<i>Shir HaShirim</i> 3:10.) Because love is too abstract a
commodity with which to build, Hashem chose precious metals that are dear to
man and that man has an emotional attachment to, and by giving these metals one
is really donating the emotional attachment contained therein. It is for this
reason that the Torah that a constant refrain throughout the <i>parshiyos</i>
dealing with the <i>Mishkan</i> is <i>nedivas halev</i> - "every man whose
heart motivates him" (<i>Shemos</i> 25:2.) In actuality, the Sanctuary was
built upon the <i>nedivas halev</i> that was contained within the gold, silver,
and copper.</p>

<P>King David explains (<i>Chronicles</i> I 28:3) that because
he has been a warrior, albeit to destroy the enemies of the Jewish people, and
has shed much blood, he cannot build the <i>Beis Hamikdosh</i>. In (29:2) he
declares, "with all my might I have prepared for the Temple of my G-d,
gold for golden things, silver for silver things, and copper for copper
things". The <i>Maggid</i> teaches that the apparent repetition is not to
state the obvious, i.e. that gold was used for golden objects, but rather to
communicate that <i>ha'zahav</i>, the gold, the golden emotion of love,
or the love in the gold, was utilized in the construction.</p>

<P>In many areas of Jewish law one can use an object of equal
value as payment (<i>shaveh kesef k'kesef</i>). For example, one has to redeem
their firstborn son with 5 silver coins, but if one does not have coins a Kohen
can accept a silver wine cup in their place. We read last week about <i>machatzis
hashekel</i>, the annual monetary contribution to the <i>Beis Hamikdosh</i> to
fund communal offerings. If one did not have a half <i>shekel</i> he could give
an object of equal worth which the Temple treasurer would exchange for money. When
it came to donations for building the mishkan, however, <i>Seforno</i> explains
that the word "this" in the <i>passuk, </i>"This is the
portion that you shall take from them, gold, silver, copper" (<i>Shemos</i>
25:3) excludes the possibility of donating any other materials, including money,
to exchange for these precious metals. Offering a substitute would be miss the
key component, the <i>nedivas halev</i>. Once again the Torah is highlighting
that it's not the gold per se that Hashem wanted as a contribution as much as that
which is represented by the gold, i.e. man's love of it and his
attachment to it. In essence, we are being taught that the <i>Mishkan</i> was
built with the emotions and spiritual energy invested into the physical
components.</p>

<P>There is another understanding of "<i>tocho ratzuf
ahava</i>", namely, its foundation is that of <u>continuous</u> love. The
establishment of the <i>Beis Hamikdosh</i>, this special meeting place for G-d
and man, reflects the mutual outpouring of love between them. In reality, all that
we do can either reflect our <i>nedivas halev</i> - our excitement, enthusiasm,
and love for Hashem and His <i>Mitzvos</i> - or a <i>laissez-faire</i>,
lackadaisical attitude towards <i>mitzvos</i>. One can <i>daven</i> with <i>nedivas
halev</i> or by rote; one can give <i>tzedakah</i> with <i>nedivas halev</i> or
be guilted into giving or give to have their name in lights. Even one's <i>chessed</i>
can be performed with <i>nedivas halev</i>, exercising great sensitivity to
safeguard the dignity of the recipient, or for personal self-aggrandizement; the
manner in which we speak to our spouse and children can be either with <i>nedivas
halev</i>, respect and admiration, or unfortunately demeaning.</p>

<P>As we take leave of the physical building of the <i>Mishkan</i>
- "all the work of the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, was
completed" (<i>Shemos</i> 39:32) - we must take the <i>Mishkan</i> with
us. "<i>B'l'vavi mishkan evneh</i>" in our hearts - or more
importantly, with our hearts - we too can build a <i>Mishkan</i>. "They
shall make a Sanctuary for Me so that I may dwell among them" (<i>Shemos</i>
25:8). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chaim </i>232) devotes an entire chapter
to expounding the <i>passuk</i>, "<i>B'chol derachecha da'ei'hu</i>
- in all your activities know Him" (Proverbs 3:6.) One's many hours
engaged in earning a livelihood can be infused with <i>nedivas halev</i> by
working to send one's children to yeshiva, to be able to give charity, to
manifest in his business a <i>kiddush</i> Hashem, and to be able to create a
home that is truly <i>shehasimcha b'mono</i> - that He has another place to
live and love.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: shlach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>At first glance, the opening Rashi of <i>Parshas Shlach</i>
is most challenging. Rashi explains the juxtaposition of the episode of the <i>meraglim</i>
and the end of <i>Beha'aloscha</i> where Miriam and Aharon speak <i>lashon
hora</i> regarding Moshe, to be that they, the spies, who saw that Miriam was
punished with leprosy, should have learned a lesson and not spoken <i>lashon
hora </i>about <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. How is this comparison to be understood?</p>

<P>The Rambam (<i>Hilchos Tumas Tzara'as</i> 15:10) ends
the section with a moral-ethical teaching. He asserts that what we call <i>tzara'as</i>
was not part of the natural world. Discoloration on houses, garments, and on
the body occurred to cause the individual to realize that their negative speech
was a direct contradiction to the Divine plan and calling of man. Onkelus
understands the words, "a living soul" in the <i>passuk</i>, "He
blew into his nostrils the soul of life and the man was a living soul" (<i>Bereshis</i>
2:7) to mean, "a speaking person", and by man sullying his mouth
with negative speech thereby diminishes the Divine image implanted in, and
entrusted to, him.</p>

<P>The Rambam continues, "'remember what Hashem
your God did to Miriam on the way when you were leaving Egypt' (<i>Devarim</i>
24:9) Now: Miriam the prophetess, older sister of Moshe, who helped raise him,
risked her life to save him, and she did not speak '<i>b'g'nuso</i>'
- in a disparaging manner regarding Moshe. Rather she erred by equating him
with other Prophets." The necessary background is that when Eldad and
Meidad began to prophesize in the camp (<i>Bamidbar</i> 11:26), the immediate
reaction of Tziporah (Moshe's wife) was that she felt sorry for their
wives, thinking that just as Moshe separated himself from her, they would do
likewise to their spouses. When Miriam heard this, she questioned why Moshe did
indeed separate himself. After all, she and Aharon were prophets and they did not
separate from their spouses! Miriam did not know that Moshe's action was
nothing less than a Divine decree, as Hashem told Moshe (<i>Devarim</i> 5:27-28)
after the revelation at Sinai to inform the people they were to return to their
families. Moshe, however, was told to stay with Hashem and be literally on call
24x7. The Torah informs us (12:3) Moshe was exceedingly humble and therefore
told no one of his exclusive status.</p>

<P>The Rambam was teaching us that Miriam's failure to
recognize the unique position of Moshe and not attributing to him the respect
due to the <i>av hanevi'im</i> - father of the prophets (the seventh of
Rambam's thirteen principles of faith) is within the rubric of <i>lashon
hora</i>. The Torah is thus raising the bar and definition of <i>lashon hora</i>.
Not only is it forbidden to speak outright <i>g'nus</i>-negativity about
an individual (unless it is within the <i>halachic</i> circumstances that one
must reveal specific information to someone who will be affected) but even
diminishing someone's status and reputation is forbidden. As such, if one
hears that someone is an outstanding <i>talmid chacham</i> or expert in a
particular field and retorts saying "no - he is only average", this
too is considered <i>lashon hora</i>.</p>

<P>This is the thrust of the moving beautiful "<i>Adarabah</i>"
<i>tefillah</i> of Rav Elimelech of Lizhensk wherein we ask for Divine
assistance in properly evaluating others - "May we see the good in our
friends and acquaintances and not their faults and deficiencies." The
Chassidic master, a student of the <i>Magid</i> of Mezeritch, acknowledges that
if one only looks they will find flaws in another person's personality.
His prayer is that we should focus on the good. This is not always an easy
task. One of my teachers suggests as a practical way to implement this noble
and positive mandate is to recall the stern verse that ascribes the manifold
lists of curses and afflictions in the <i>tochacha</i> in <i>Devarim</i>
(28:47) that would occur to the Jewish people to, "Because you did not
serve Hashem, your God, amid gladness and goodness of heart, when everything
was abundant - <i>merov kol</i>s." The Torah's words, "<i>merov
kol</i>" can be explained as, "most things were good." In
your own life how are you to fulfill "<i>ivdu es Hashem b'simcha</i>
- serve Hashem with joy" (<i>Tehillim</i> 100:2)? Only by realizing that
the cup is either half full or empty. Focus on His Divine gifts and blessings
to keep your personal <i>simcha</i> level high, and similarly look at the
positive traits in others and say, "thank you Hashem for having my path
cross theirs, for me to learn and be enriched."</p>

<P>This cardinal lesson of properly assessing the character of
others, taught by the above Rambam, applies to <i>Eretz Yisrael </i>as well.
The sin of Miriam was not ascribing to Moshe his unique role and position.
Similarly the <i>meraglim</i> failed to ascribe to the land of Israel its
unique nature and qualities. Everything they saw and reported regarding the
land - that is was fortified and most difficult to conquer - was accurate. The
Chasam Sofer <i>zt"l</i> teaches that it was precisely for that reason
that the people were to know that only with Divine assistance could they
conquer the land. They forgot the idea articulated by the very first Rashi of
the Torah, i.e. that Hashem created the world and chose this land for this
people. The spiritual DNA of this people is different - it is charged with
spirituality and so too is this land programmed to produce and respond only to
its inhabitants. History has shown that for almost two thousand years the
beloved land of Israel refused to accept any other people's attempt to
settle and cultivate the land. Like a faithful lover it waited patiently for
its beloved people <i>Am</i> Yisrael.</p>

<P>May we be <i>zoche</i> to look and find the good in the next
one thereby enriching ourselves.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: shoftim]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Man resists change! Starting with the first man the Torah
teaches (<i>Bereshis</i> 2:15), "Hashem took a man and placed him in the
Garden of Eden to work it and guard it." Rashi comments that as in many
other places in the Torah, the word "took - <i>vayikach</i>" is not
simply to move an individual, but to persuade an individual, as is the case in <i>Bereshis</i>
12:5 and <i>Bamidbar</i> 16:1. Adam was instinctively unwilling to move from
where he was created and needed Hashem's persuasion to do so. Similarly,
to exit the Garden, the Torah teaches (<i>Bereshis</i> 3:23), "Hashem
politely asked man to leave the Garden" again resisting change. Hashem then
expels him from the Garden as is seen in the next verse. Many of the <i>mussar</i>
teachers, including the late Rav Yaakov Lessin <i>z"tl</i> of <i>Yeshivas
Rabbeinu Yitzchack Elchanan</i> quote the teaching of Reb Yisroel Salanter <i>z"tl</i>
that it is easier to finish studying the entire Talmud, than to change one of
our character traits.</p>

<P>Rav Dr. Avraham Twersky (<u>Addictive Thinking</u>, page 23)
mentions the following noteworthy experiment: fold your hands across your chest
and observe the position of your hands. Some people fold their left hand over
their right, while others do the reverse. After noting how you do it, unfold
your hands. Now fold them again, but this time in the opposite way, i.e. if you
normally put right over left, put left over right. You will probably notice how
awkward this feels. The old way is normal and relaxing, the new way may seem
strange and you may feel you could never relax in this position. If a simple
change in hand positions is uncomfortable, just think how uncomfortable it is
to change part of your behavior or lifestyle.</p>

<P>Rav Eliyahu Schlesinger (in <i>Eileh Hadevarim</i>) gives
several powerful examples of great individuals who resisted change. Our Ravs
(<i>Eruvin</i> 19b) teach that evildoers even at the brink of <i>gehenom</i>
(hell) do not change and repent. Case in point: after the city of Jericho was
burnt and destroyed, Yehoshua imposed a curse on whoever would attempt to
rebuild that city - (6:16) "with his oldest child he will lay its
foundation, and with his youngest he will set up its gates." Though a most
frightening curse that one would lose each of his sons during the construction
was in effect, five centuries later (during the reign of Achov) Chiel of
Beth-El defied the admonition of Yehoshua and suffered that exact outcome:
"Chiel the Bethelite built up Jericho, with the death of Abirom, his
firstborn, he laid it's foundations, and with the death of Segud, his youngest,
he installed its doors, like the word of Hashem that He had spoken through
Yehoshua son of Nun" (I Kings 16:34.) Ask yourself how it is possible that
after the passing of his oldest, which occurred with the laying of the
foundation, and the subsequent passing of his sons, he could continue to defy
the word and will of Hashem? The above teaching of (<i>Eruvin</i> 19b) doesn't
explain how, but does give us a glimpse of man's resistance to change.</p>

<P>Moreover, the <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> (I Kings 18) relates
that when Eliyahu <i>haNavi</i> challenged the 450 prophets of Baal to bring
down the fire from heaven, this same Chiel agreed to risk his life under the
altar they had constructed and was to ignite a fire from beneath the altar
giving the impression that Baal had indeed responded to their request, only to
be bitten and killed by a snake sent from Hashem.</p>

<P>A second example: In the days of Yirmiyahu there was a false
prophet named Chananya ben Azor, who tried to influence the Jewish nation
against Yirmiyahu and against returning to Hashem. Yirmiyahu prophesized that
the false prophet would die that year. Chananya died as taught in (Yirmiyahu
28:17) and Rashi teaches that his last will and testament to his children was
to please bury him after Rosh Hashana to show that the word of Yirmiyahu was
not actualized. Once again, at the opening of <i>gehenom</i> the wicked do not
repent!</p>

<P>Finally, YeRavam ben Novot, while offering incense to
idolatry, is confronted by Ido the <i>navi</i> and is told that the very altar
YeRavam is serving on will split and its ashes spilled. YeRavam stretched out
his arm and proclaimed "seize him". At that point his arm became
paralyzed (I Kings 13:4) and he could not withdraw his arm. The altar broke, its
ashes spilled, and YeRavam asked the prophet to pray to Hashem that his arm be
healed. The prophet prayed and the verse continues, "and the king was able
to draw his arm back, <i>vatehi k'varishona</i> - and it was as before."
The literal understanding of the last phrase is that is said regarding his arm,
but the Medrash Tanchuma (Parshas Ki Sisa) understands it to refer to the king
- <u>he</u> was like before, namely he returned to his idolatry.</p>

<P>The three examples cited above show how entrenched one can
be in one's ways and how difficult it is to change. Hopefully the issues
we each grapple with are not as extreme in terms of fundamentals and belief;
but the cited examples still clearly demonstrate how man's addiction can
consume his mind and actions.</p>

<P>Given the difficulty to change, I believe the first step is
for everyone to pray for <i>siyata diShmaya</i>, Divine assistance, in the
process. The first <i>bracha</i> in the second section of the daily <i>Shemoneh
Esrei</i> is for <i>binah</i> - intelligence, understanding, and proper
perspective. What follows immediately is the <i>bracha</i> for <i>teshuva</i> -
repentance. We beseech Hashem to grant us the wisdom and ability to be open to
change.</p>

<P>Secondly, an important component regarding the challenge of
change is to heed the teaching (<i>Avos</i> 1:16), "get yourself a
teacher"- a mentor who, by virtue of one's association, serves as a
positive inspiration for growth and personal accountability.</p>

<P>Finally, the Shaloh and the B'nei Yissaschar (in <i>Agra d'Kallah</i>)
understand the opening verse of <i>Parshas Shoftim</i>, which speaks of the
appointment of judges and officers in all your gates, to refer not only
literally to your communities, but also to the seven openings of the head: two
eyes, two ears, two nostrils and the mouth. These gates are to be in your
control, meaning to be on guard to create for yourself a positive, nurturing
environment open for growth.</p>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Daniel Stein]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2017]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: 9av]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>While
recounting the sin of the <i>meraglim</i>, the spies, in <i>Parshas Devarim</i>,
Moshe mentions that upon realizing the costly mistake of maligning <i>Eretz</i>
<i>Yisrael</i>, <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> expressed a sincere desire to rectify the
situation, as the <i>pasuk</i> states, "then you answered and said to me,
We have sinned against <i>Hashem</i>, we will go up and fight, according to all
that <i>Hashem</i> has commanded us" (<i>Devarim</i> 1:41). <i>Hashem</i>
instructs Moshe to refuse this gesture by saying, "Neither go up nor
fight, for I am not among you, lest you be struck down before your enemies."
<i>Bnei Yisrael</i> did not heed <i>Hashem</i>'s warning and they subsequently
waged an unsuccessful battle to conquer <i>Eretz Israel</i> where they are
slaughtered <i>en masse</i>. Why did <i>Hashem</i> thwart the attempted
repentance of <i>Bnei Yisrael</i>? Why were they prevented from repairing their
initial rejection of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and their preliminary lack of
enthusiasm? </p>


<P>The <i>Ralbag</i>
explains that <i>Hashem</i> did not rebuff their <i>teshuvah</i> per say, rather
it was simply ineffective in gaining them entry into <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>
because it came too late. The window of opportunity to enter <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>
at this time had already expired. Often times, and in all aspects of life, if
an opportunity is not capitalized upon immediately, it can disappear, and it
may be impossible to fully recapture it or reclaim it at some later point.
Opportunity knocks once, maybe twice, but then it is gone. The period of the <i>Bein
Hametzarim</i>, and specifically the morning of <i>Tisha Bav</i>, also seem to
represent a similar type of limited and confined opportunity. </p>


<P>The <i>pasuk</i>
in <i>Eichah</i> (1:15) refers to <i>Tisha Bav</i> as a <i>moed</i> or holiday.
Indeed, the Apta Rav (<i>Ohav Yisrael</i>) observes that the entire period of
the <i>Bein Hametzarim</i>, consisting of the twenty-two days from the
seventeenth of Tammuz until the ninth of Av <span style='display:none'>however see
<i>Rashi</i> to <i>Koheles</i> 12, 6) </span>corresponds to the twenty-two days
of festivals that we celebrate in the diaspora throughout the year, including
the eight days of <i>Pesach</i>, the two days of <i>Shavuos</i>, the two days
of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, <i>Yom Kippur</i>, and the nine days of <i>Sukkos</i>
and <i>Shemini Atzeres</i>. Moreover, we regularly begin the period of the <i>Bein
Hametzarim </i>with the reading of <i>Parshas Pinchas</i>, which enumerates the
entire gamut of <i>moadim</i>, perhaps indicating further that the <i>Bein
Hametzarim </i>and <i>Tisha Bav</i> are also part of the "holiday"
cycle. </p>

<P>How
can the mourning of the <i>Bein Hametzarim </i>and <i>Tisha Bav</i> possibly be
included or equated with the celebrations of the other holidays and <i>moadim</i>?
What characteristic do they share in common? Rav Mordechai Gifter quoted in the
name of Rav Avrohom Yitzchak Bloch, that the <i>Bein Hametzarim </i>and <i>Tisha
Bav</i> can be considered <i>moadim</i>, because a "<i>moed</i>"<i>
</i>refers to any period of time that presents us with an opportunity to
interface directly with <i>Hashem</i> (see <i>Shemos</i> 25:22). Throughout the
regular cycle of the <i>moadim</i> we have an opportunity to interact directly
with <i>Hashem</i> on positive terms and for happy occasions. The <i>Bein
Hametzarim</i> and <i>Tisha Bav</i> are rightfully considered <i>moadim</i>
because they also afford us an opportunity to encounter <i>Hashem</i> directly,
albeit in the guise of sadness and mourning. Therefore, the <i>Bein Hametzarim</i>
and <i>Tisha Bav</i>, should not be viewed as obstacles in our summer that must
be endured and overcome, but rather as opportunities to interact and encounter <i>Hashem</i>
directly, that should be grasped and exploited. </p>


<P>However,
it seems that this rare opportunity begins to dissipate and slip away in the
afternoon of <i>Tisha Bav</i>. Even though, the <i>halachos</i> of mourning build
progressively throughout the <i>Bein Hametzarim</i>, climaxing on the night and
morning of <i>Tisha</i> <i>Bav</i>, after midday on <i>Tisha Bav</i> they abruptly
change course, and begin to loosen and relax. In fact, the <i>Bnei Yisaschar</i>
notes that the entire period of the Nine Days, from <i>Rosh Chodesh Av</i>
through <i>Tisha Bav</i>, contains two hundred and sixteen hours, corresponding
to the numerical value of the word "<i>aryeh</i>" or "lion."
This is because, just like the <i>pasuk</i> states "when the lion roars
who does not fear" (<i>Amos</i> 3:8), similarly, who amongst us does not
tremble from the devastation and mourning of the Nine Days which lasts for two
hundred and sixteen hours. However, when the word "<i>aryeh</i>"
"lion" appears in <i>Eichah</i> (3:10) it is missing the letter
"<i>heh</i>", corresponding to the number five, perhaps reflecting
the notion, that during the final five hours of <i>Tisha Bav</i>, after midday,
the intensity of the mourning has already started to subside.</p>

<P>This
is surprising because the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Taanis</i> 29a) tells us that historically
the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> only began to burn in earnest on the afternoon of the
ninth of Av, after which it continued to burn throughout the tenth of Av. In
recognition of that historical reality, Rav Yochanan claims that personally he
would have instituted the tenth day of Av as the day of extreme mourning
instead of the ninth of Av. If the destruction primarily took place in the
afternoon on the ninth of Av, why do our practices of mourning subside in the
afternoon, if anything they should become more severe? Rav Tzvi Meir Zilberberg
suggests that upon witnessing the beginning of the burning of the <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i> in the afternoon of <i>Tisha</i> <i>Bav</i>, <i>Klal</i> <i>Yisrael</i>
was utterly shocked and transformed. At that point, they sincerely expressed
remorse and began to repent. Therefore, our practices of mourning weaken and
decrease in the afternoon of <i>Tisha Bav</i>, because after midday, <i>Bnei
Yisrael</i> had already begun to do <i>teshuvah</i>! </p>

<P>In
fact, the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Yoma</i> 54b) states that when the gentile
marauders entered the Holy of Holies at the time of the destruction of the <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i> the <i>keurivm</i> on top of the <i>Aron</i> were facing one another.
The <i>Shita Mekubetzes</i> finds this difficult to reconcile with the statement
of the Gemara (<i>Bava Basra</i> 99a) which resolves that the <i>keruvim</i>
would only face each other when <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> enjoyed a harmonious
relationship with <i>Hashem</i>, but when there was distance and discord
between them, the <i>keruvim</i> would face apart from one another. Since the
destruction of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> was precipitated by a religious
rebellion and rampant lack of observance, why were the <i>keruvim</i> facing
each other at the time of the <i>churban</i>? Rav Tzadok Hakohen asserts that
the <i>keruvim</i> were facing one another because in the middle of the day on
the ninth of Av, once the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> had started to burn, <i>Klal
Yisrael</i> had undertaken to do <i>teshuvah</i> and repent, thereby restoring
and repairing their relationship with <i>Hashem</i>.</p>

<P>However,
if <i>Klal Yisrael</i> had accepted to do <i>teshuvah</i> in the afternoon of
the ninth of Av, when they witnessed the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> starting to
burn, why were their efforts not effective in stemming the tide, and averting
the remainder of the calamity? Rav Tzvi Meir continues that their repentance could
not halt the developing <i>churban</i>, because it came too late. The <i>churban</i>
had been triggered and set in motion, and the window of opportunity to do <i>teshuvah</i>
in a fashion that would arouse injunctive relief, had already passed. Therefore,
we should and must learn from the mistakes of our past, to capitalize on the
precious and timely opportunity of the Nine Days and specifically the morning
of <i>Tisha Bav</i> to do <i>teshuvah</i> with alacrity and purpose, and not
allow this precious opportunity to slip through our fingers once again. If we
do so, may <i>Hashem</i> grant our desperate plea "Restore us to You, <i>Hashem</i>,

<P align="center"><B>Our Dual Relationship with Hashem</b></p>


<P>There is an undeniable bond between
the <i>mitzvah</i> of offering the <i>korban pesach</i> and the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>bris milah</i>. They are the only two positive commandments whose
violation elicits the punishment of <i>kareis</i>, and as perhaps alluded to by
the gRave consequences levied against those who neglect these two <i>mitzvos</i>,
they are both arguably indispensable ingredients to the Jewish experience. The <i>pasuk</i>
states in <i>Parshas Bo</i>, "And should a convert
reside with you, he shall make a Passover sacrifice to Hashem," (<i>Shemos</i>
12, 48) from which the <i>Medrash</i> cited by <i>Rashi</i> initially infers
that aside from the <i>bris</i> <i>milah</i> and immersion in a <i>mikvah</i>, every
convert must offer a <i>korban</i> <i>pesach</i> immediately upon his
conversion, no matter what time of year the conversion occurs. The <i>Medrash</i>
ultimately rejects this suggestion, but the <i>Meshech Chochma</i> concludes
nonetheless that a convert can substitute the <i>korban pesach</i> in place of
the typical <i>korban</i> offered by every convert upon their conversion. The
relationship between <i>korban</i> <i>pesach</i> and <i>bris</i> <i>milah</i> is
further underscored when we consider the unique exclusion "but no
uncircumcised male may partake of it", that no uncircumcised Jewish male
may participate in the <i>korban</i> <i>pesach</i>. Perhaps these two <i>mitzvos</i>
are so intertwined and so central because they represent two critical
dimensions to our relationship with <i>Hashem</i>.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

<P>The <i>bris</i> <i>milah</i> represents
a personal commitment to serving Hashem, modeled after <i>Avraham</i> <i>Avinu</i>
who was the first person to perform <i>bris milah</i>, and who independently
discovered and forged a relationship with <i>Hashem</i> amidst a polytheistic
culture. Whereas the <i>korban</i> <i>Pesach</i> corresponds to the birth of
the Jewish nation and is a response to our shared experience of leaving <i>Mitzrayim</i>
as a people. This is the platform through which we relate to Hashem not as
individuals but as a member of the <i>Bnei</i> <i>Yisrael</i>. Every Jew as
well as every successful convert must subscribe to these two notions. It is not
sufficient to create a personal relationship with the Almighty represented by
the <i>bris</i> <i>milah</i>, but we must also intimately identify with the
history of the Jewish people signified by the <i>korban</i> <i>Pesach</i>.
Additionally, the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Yevamos</i> 47a) mandates that we question
interested candidates for conversion, "'What reason have you for desiring
to become a convert; do you not know that Israel, at the present time, is persecuted
and oppressed, despised, harassed and overcome by afflictions?" Rav
Soloveitchik once suggested that perhaps we inform all potential converts of
our standing within the world not because we seek to discourage them, but
rather to give them the opportunity to connect with our national identity and
destiny, which is a critical component of the conversion process and our
relationship with <i>Hashem</i>.</p>

<P align="center"><B>The Blood of the <i>Korban Pesach</i> and the Blood of <i>Bris Milah</i></b></p>

<P>Indeed, it was in the merit of the
these two <i>mitzvos</i>, and these two aspects to our relationship with <i>Hashem</i>,
that we were redeemed from <i>Mitrzayim</i>. <i>Rashi</i> (<i>Shemos</i> 12, 6)
cites the <i>Medrash</i> which interprets the <i>pasuk</i> "but you were
naked and bare" (<i>Yechezkel</i> 16, 7) as reflecting the Jewish
people's inferior spiritual status and their unworthiness to be redeemed.
In order to elevate <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> and justify their redemption, Hashem
provided us with these two <i>mitzvos</i>, "And I passed
by you and saw you downtrodden with your blood, and I said to you, 'With your
blood, live,' and I said to you, 'With your blood, live" (ibid 6),
referring to the blood of the <i>korban</i> <i>pesach</i> and the blood of <i>bris</i>
<i>milah</i>. <i>Targum</i> <i>Yonasan</i> continues that for this reason the
blood from both these <i>mitzvos</i> was mixed and placed on the doorpost
during the plague of the firstborn. This is perhaps alluded to in the language
of the <i>pasuk</i>, which repeats the word "blood" twice, "</a>And the <u>blood</u> will be for you for a sign upon the houses
where you will be, and I will see the <u>blood</u> and skip over you," (<i>Shemos</i>
12, 13) referring to both the blood of the <i>korban</i> <i>pesach</i> as well
as the blood of <i>bris</i> <i>milah</i>. The <i>Alshich</i> <i>Hakadosh </i>adds
that for this reason the blood was placed "on the two
doorposts and on the lintel" (12, 7), the two doorposts representing
Moshe and Aharon, the leaders of the Jewish nation and our relationship with
Hashem as part of the <i>Bnei Yisrael</i>, and the lintel corresponds to <i>Hashem</i>,
representing our direct, individual, and personal commitment to <i>Hashem</i>.</p>

<P>However, the blood of these two <i>mitzvos</i>
was mixed and placed on the doorpost together, perhaps indicating that these
are not two separate notions and dimensions to our relationship with <i>Hashem</i>
but one in the same. Each aspect of this relationship informs and compliments
the other. In that sense, we must personalize our commemoration of <i>yetzias
Mitzrayim</i> through our participation in the <i>korban Pesach</i> and by
extension the entire <i>seder</i> experience. We must take the national story
of <i>yetzias Mitrzayim</i> and make it our own individual narrative as well,
by peppering it with instances of divine intervention and divine providence
that we have personally witnessed and benefited from in our own lives. It has
been widely observed, that the text of Haggadah has more commentaries than
almost any other Jewish text, rivaled only by the Torah itself. Every group, every
sect, and every yeshivah, within the Jewish community, has their own
observations and interpretations of the Pesach story and the text of the
Haggadah. Perhaps this reflects the measure of personal input that we are
required to bring to bear on the night of the <i>seder</i>. Through the lens
and inspiration of retelling and reexperiencing the story of <i>yetizas
Mitrzaym</i> on the night of the <i>seder</i>, every one of us is enjoined to
reflect on our own personal encounters with the hand of Hashem, the <i>yad</i> <i>Hashem</i>,
and how that has facilitated our own personal arc and destiny.</p>

<P align="center"><B>Moshe's Unique Story</b></p>

<P>After the plague of hail, Moshe
threatened Pharoh that if he did not immediately release the Jewish people he
would suffer a plague of locusts. The <i>Ramban</i> and <i>Baalei Hatosfos</i>
note that prior to all the other plagues Hashem informed Moshe as to the nature
of the ensuing plague. However, with regards to the plague of locusts, we
don't find any such prior notification. How was Moshe able to correctly
predict that the next plague would be locusts if <i>Hashem</i> didn't
inform him beforehand? The <i>Ramban</i> claims that just like the other
plagues, Hashem must have informed Moshe earlier even though it is not recorded
in the text itself. The <i>Baalei Hatosfos</i> suggest that all the plagues
were alluded to on Moshe's staff through the abbreviated inscription, <i>detzach</i>,
<i>adash</i>, <i>beachav</i>. Rav Shimshon from Ostropol brilliantly suggests
that the plague of locusts, <i>arbeh</i>, is foreshadowed in the words
"come to Pharoh", "<i>bo el Paroh</i>" (<i>Shemos</i>
9, 1). The word "<i>bo</i>" is spelled <i>beis</i> <i>aleph</i>,
and the letters <i>beis</i> and <i>peh</i> as well as <i>aleph</i> and <i>ayin</i>
are interchangeable since they are formed with the same part of the mouth.
Therefore, he suggests that the pasuk "<i>bo el Paroh</i>" was
instructing Moshe to switch the letters <i>beis</i> and <i>aleph</i> of "<i>bo</i>"
for their counterparts in the word "<i>Paroh</i>", spelled <i>peh
reish ayin heh</i>, which if rearranged yields the letters <i>aleph reish beis
heh</i>, or <i>arbeh</i>, locusts. The <i>Chasam Sofer</i> takes an even more
novel approach when he submits that the plague of locusts was in fact Moshe's
own idea! After the first seven plagues were successfully dictated by <i>Hashem</i>
and implemented by Moshe, Moshe was given the latitude to concoct his own
punishment for the Egyptians, and he chose locusts. This provided Moshe with a
personal and unique perspective on <i>yetizas Mitrayim</i>, and a part of the
story that was not shared with anyone else.</p>

<P>Perhaps, for this reason that <i>pasuk</i>
states, "in order that you tell into the ears of your
son and your son's son how I made a mockery of the Egyptians ... and <u>you</u>
will know that I am <i>Hashem</i>" (<i>Shemos</i> 10, 2). The <i>pasuk</i>
begins in the singular, "your son," and concludes in the plural
"you will know." The Belzer Rebbe explains that this is because in
the generation of those who left Egypt the only person whose children did not
experience <i>yetizas Mitzrayim</i> firsthand was Moshe, whose children who
were still in <i>Midyan</i> at the time. Therefore, the <i>pasuk</i> begins in
the singular, because initially the only person out of all of the <i>Bnei</i> <i>Yisrael</i>
who had a mitzvah to recount the story of <i>yetzias</i> <i>Mitzrayim</i> to
their children was Moshe. (This might explain why Moshe's name does not
appear throughout the entire text of the Haggadah, because Moshe himself was
the original narrator of the story). Nonetheless, the <i>pasuk</i> concludes in
the plural, because in subsequent generations all Jews are bound by the duty to
teach their children the story of the exodus. However, just like Moshe not only
told his children the generic story of the <i>yetzias Mitrzayim</i>, but also
his own personal individual account, so too, each one of us must share with our
children as well our own unique perspective and personal insight. Only if we
color the story of <i>yetzias Mitrzyaim</i> with our own individual experiences
and encounters with the <i>yad</i> <i>Hashem</i>, thereby fulfilling the first
part of the <i>pasuk</i>, "tell into the ears of your son", can our
children be successful in attaining the conclusion of the <i>pasuk</i>,
"and you will know that I am <i>Hashem</i>."</p>

<P align="center"><B><i>Shabbos Hagadol</i></b></p>

<P>The <i>Tur</i> explains that the Shabbos prior to Pesach is known as <i>Shabbos Hagadol</i>, the Great Shabbos,
because it was on the Shabbos prior to <i>yetzias Mitrzayim</i> that the <i>Bnei
Yisrael</i> designated their sheep for the <i>korban pesach</i>, thereby
fulfilling the <i>pasuk</i> "draw forth or buy for yourselves sheep for
your families and slaughter the Passover sacrifice" (<i>Shemos</i> 12,
21). This was indeed a great miracle because the sheep were worshipped as a
deity in Egypt, and yet the Egyptians did not protest when the <i>Bnei Yisrael</i>
designated thousands of sheep for slaughter. However, the <i>Medrash</i>
observes that the <i>pasuk</i> begins "draw forth", because even
amongst the <i>Bnei Yisrael</i>, there were still individuals who were
worshipping <i>avodah zara</i>. Therefore, before designating a sheep for the <i>korban</i>
<i>pesach</i> Moshe instructed them to withdraw their hand, and to cease and
desist their practices of <i>avodah</i> <i>zara</i>. However, this is somewhat
difficult to understand, after all, <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> were now standing at
the culmination of the process of the redemption. How could it be that Moshe
waited until this late stage before instructing them to abandon their practices
of <i>avodah</i> <i>zarah</i>?</p>

<P>Rav Kalonymus Kalman Shapira (<i>Eish Kodesh</i>) explains that of coarse <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> had renounced their
practices of idol worship long ago, but upon their introduction and exposure to
the mitzvah of <i>korban</i> <i>pesach</i>, Moshe was encouraging them not to
view the <i>mitzvah</i> as someone else's <i>mitzvah</i>, or as someone
else's religion, as <i>avodah</i> <i>zarah</i>, a foreign service, but
rather to embrace and make the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>korban</i> <i>pesach</i>
their own. Similarly, we must embrace and transform the national story of the <i>seder
night</i> represented by the <i>korban pesach</i>, into our own personal
narrative. The <i>Pirkei D'Rebbi Eliezer </i>comments that the <i>pasuk</i>
repeats twice, "and I said to you, With your blood, live,' and I said to you, 'With your blood, live," because
just like the redemption from <i>Mitzrayim</i> was precipitated by the
unification of the <i>mitzvos</i> of <i>bris milah</i> and <i>korban</i> <i>pesach</i>
representing the individual relationship with <i>Hashem</i> and our national
relationship with <i>Hashem</i>, so too the final redemption will only
materialize when we successfully integrate these two experiences and commitments.
Therefore, on the Shabbos before Pesach we are reminded to personalize the
Pesach story, to make it our own, because only in this way can we merit to
transmit the story to the next generation and to ultimately be <i>zoche</i> to
a <i>geulah</i> once again, <i>bemheirah</i> <i>beyameinu amein</i>!</p>

		<title><![CDATA[The Unity of the <i>Sukkah</i> and the <i>Daled Minim</i>]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Daniel Stein]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2017]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: sukkos]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>According to <i>Chazal</i>, both of the <i>mitzvos</i>
that we perform on the holiday of <i>Sukkos</i>, taking the <i>daled</i> <i>minim</i>,
the four species, as well as dwelling in the <i>sukkah</i>, represent <i>achdus</i>,
unity. The <i>Medrash</i> compares
the <i>esrog</i>, which has an appetizing taste and a pleasing aroma, to
Jews who possess both Torah learning and the performance of <i>mitzvos</i>; the
<i>lulav</i>, the date palm, which has a positive flavor but no fragrance, to
those Jews who have Torah learning but lack good deeds; the <i>hadasim</i>, the
myrtle, which has fragrance but no taste, to Jews who perform <i>mitzvos</i>
but lack the learning of Torah; and the <i>aRavos</i>, the willow, to those Jews
who lack both Torah learning and as well as good deeds. During <i>Sukkos</i> we
bind all of these species together to underscore the necessity of uniting all
Jews together under the mutual banner of serving the <i>Ribbono</i> <i>Shel</i>
<i>Olam</i>. Similarly, the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Sukkah</i> 27b) derives from the <i>pasuk</i>
"Every citizen in Yisrael shall dwell in <i>sukkos</i>" (Vaykira
23, 42), that all of the people of Israel could theoretically dwell in one <i>sukkah
</i>for the <i>sukkah</i> need not be owned by those sitting within it.<i> </i>Undoubtedly,
all of <i>Klal</i> <i>Yisrael</i> inhabiting one <i>sukkah</i>, coexisting
under the same roof for seven consecutive days, would be a powerful statement
of unity, and <i>achdus</i>. </p>

<P>However, in actuality these two symbols of <i>achdus</i>,
correspond to two distinct forms of unity. In <i>Parshas Vayechi</i>, Yaakov <i>Avinu</i>
twice summons all of his children before his death, "Gather, and I will tell you what will happen to you at
the end of days. Gather and listen, sons
of Yaakov, and listen to Yisrael, your father" (<i>Breishis</i> 49, 1-2). The <i>Sfas Emes</i> explains that
Yaakov beseeched his children to gather together in a show of unity two times,
corresponding to two discrete types of <i>achdus</i>. There is the <i>achdus</i> of individuals who
don't necessarily enjoy each other inherently, however, they share a
common goal and agenda which breeds a bond born out of convenience and
expediency. Much like siblings who gather sparingly only to honor their
parents. This is the unity being described in Yaakov's latter plea
"Gather and listen, sons of Yaakov, and listen to Yisrael your
father." However, in Yaakov's first call for <i>achdus</i>, which provided
no further context other than a directive to "gather", he was
hoping for a deeper and more profound kind of unity, which is the aspiration of
every parent. He was yearning for the genuine <i>achdus</i> of loving siblings,
who sincerely like each other, and for whom honoring their parents is not an
anchor, but a pretext, or an excuse to see and spend time with each other.</p>

<P>The <i>Chofetz Chaim</i> observes that even though the
<i>daled</i> <i>minim</i> signify the virtue of <i>achdus</i>, the <i>esrog</i>
is not tied together with the other minim, and is generally held in a different
hand from the other species. It only joins with the other species in order to perform
and fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>daled</i> <i>minim</i>. Therefore, while
the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>daled minim</i> represents unity, it is the type of <i>achdus</i>
generated by those who possess a shared and collective goal, and unite
expressly for that purpose. Whereas the <i>achdus</i> of the <i>sukkah</i> is entirely
different. All of <i>Klal Yisrael</i> can theoretically sit in one <i>sukkah</i>
but there is certainly no <i>mitzvah</i> to do so. When many Jews choose to sit
in the same <i>sukkah</i> together, they are bound together not by a communal
obligation or common objective, but rather by a mutual fondness for one another.
Rav Dov Weinberger (<i>Shemen Hatov</i>) suggests that the <i>Arizal</i> and
the <i>Shelah Hakadosh</i> advised to take the <i>daled minim</i> in the <i>sukkah</i>
each morning of <i>Sukkos</i> in an attempt to fuse these two notions of <i>achdus</i>
together.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>
While we long to forge an honest and adoring relationship with one another, we
also desire for that relationship to be grounded in a unified vision, mission,
and purpose. Even the most loving relationships that are not founded in
substance and shared beliefs can become temperamental and indecisive. We aspire
to engender a genuine affection among all Jews and to reinforce that friendship
with a harmonious resolve and determination to serve <i>Hashem</i>.</p>

<P>Despite the fact that both the <i>sukkah</i> and the <i>daled
minim</i> remind us of the different strands of <i>achdus</i>, neither <i>mitzvah</i>
calls for absolute uniformity, in fact they both allow and even lobby for
diversity. Within the <i>achdus</i> of the <i>daled</i> <i>minim</i> there
seems to be a pecking order and each species has its own assigned seat. The <i>esrog</i>
is held in the right hand while all of the other species are in the left hand.
The <i>lulav</i> is in the center and rises above the rest. The <i>hadassim</i>
are positioned on the right of the <i>lulav</i>, but must be shorter than the
lulav and taller than the <i>aRavos</i>. The <i>aRavos</i> should be on the
left of the <i>lulav</i> and cut to be the shortest species in the bundle. How
can a symbol of unity and togetherness be so rigidly segregated? Moreover, the <i>Gemara</i>
(<i>Sukkah</i> 28a) derives from the very same <i>pasuk</i>, "Every citizen in Yisrael shall dwell in
<i>sukkos</i>", which previously emphasized
the universality of the <i>sukkah</i>, that women are exempt from the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>sukkah</i>. How can the <i>sukkah</i>, which is purported to be a
bold symbol of inclusivity, have exceptions or exclusions? Rav Yitzchok
Menachem Weinberg, the <i>Tolna Rebbe</i> (<i>Heimah Yenachamuni</i>) explains
that the <i>sukkah</i> and the <i>daled minim</i> teach us that true <i>achdus</i>
must never come at the expense of legitimate diversity, but rather demands that
we find common ground and build relationships despite our differences. </p>

<P>In fact, Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> seems to undermine his own
impassioned appeal for unity amongst his children, by subsequently blessing each
one of his children differently, as the <i>pasuk</i> states "each man
according to his blessing he blessed them" (<i>Breishis</i> 49, 28),
potentially sowing the seeds of jealously and resentment in the future. For
this reason, the <i>pasuk</i> concludes, "he blessed them", which
according to <i>Rashi</i> was meant to convey that all of the children were included
in each one of the blessings. What then was the purpose of giving each their
own individualized <i>berachah</i> in the first place? The <i>Imrei Emes</i> cites
the <i>Chiddushei Harim</i> who suggests that Yaakov was training his children
to realize that accentuating their individual roles and abilities, should never
be an obstacle to unity, but the very foundation upon which genuine <i>achdus</i>
must be built. Only when we appreciate and celebrate the differences that
inherently exist between us, can we begin to form the bonds of true <i>achdus</i>
and join together properly in the service of <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i>!</p>

<hr align=left size=1 width="33%">

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> However, see Rav Tzvi Pesach Frank, <i>Mikraei Kodesh</i> (<i>Sukkos</i> Vol. 2 Sec. 20-21) and Rav Hershel Schachter, N<i>efesh HaRav </i>(pg. 217) who raise certain objections to this practice. </p>

		<title><![CDATA[Take the Silver and the Gold - Please?]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Daniel Stein]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2017]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: bo]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>In preparation for the impending exodus from Egypt, Hashem instructed Moshe, </a>"Speak, please, into the
ears of the people, and let them borrow, each man from his friend and each
woman from her friend, silver and gold vessels" (<i>Shemos</i> 11:12). The
<i>Gemara</i> (<i>Berachos</i> 9a) infers from the language of the <i>passuk</i>
"speak <u>please</u> into the ears of the people", that Moshe was told
to graciously and tactfully request of <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> that they borrow
silver and gold vessels from the Egyptians, in order to fulfill Hashem's
prophetic pledge to Avraham "and afterwards they shall emerge with great
wealth" (<i>Breishis</i> 15, 14). The <i>meforshim</i> wonder, since most
people are eager to receive money and wealth, why did Hashem feel it was
necessary to cajole the Jewish people into taking the gold and the silver?</p>

<P>The Vilna <i>Gaon</i> explains that Hashem had
initially intended to shower <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> with great wealth only at the
conclusion of the process of the exodus, after the splitting of the Red Sea. The
possessions of the drowned Egyptians would surface to the top of the water
where they could be easily claimed by the Jewish people. However, Hashem was
concerned lest Avraham and his descendants prematurely presume that the wealth
was supposed to arrive at the beginning of the exodus, immediately upon leaving
<i>Mitzrayim</i>. In order to avoid a possible mistaken impression and erroneous
accusation, Hashem asked Moshe to encourage <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> to take the
possessions of the Egyptians with them at the beginning of their journey.
Therefore, it was necessary to say "please" because Hashem
wasn't offering the Jewish people any additional wealth at this point,
since they would have been able to effortlessly claim those very same items
after the splitting of the Red Sea. Rather, Hashem asked the Jewish people to <i>schlep</i>
the loot to the Red Sea themselves, in an attempt to prevent any confusion and
misunderstanding.</p>

<P>Alternatively, perhaps Hashem chose to use the
language of "please" in this context, in order to transform the
message to take the vessels of silver and gold from a command to a request.
That is because in general people have a visceral aversion to doing that which
they are told, even when they are being instructed to take silver and gold. Therefore,
Hashem had to graciously ask the Jewish people to take the silver and gold
instead of commanding them to do so, in order to avoid provoking resistance
from the Jewish people and potentially defaulting on His pact with Avraham <i>Avinu</i>.</p>

<P>This natural reflex to defy specific commands
seems to have been the underlying motivation behind the costly mistake made by some
Egyptians during the plague of hail. Prior to the plague of hail Moshe advised
the Egyptians, "And now, send, gather in your livestock and all that you
have in the field, for any man or beast that is found in the field and not
brought into the house the hail shall fall on them, and they will die" (<i>Shemos</i>
9, 19). The Torah continues that while there were some Egyptians who brought
their animals inside because they "feared the word of Hashem" and
heeded the advice of Moshe, there were others who "did not pay attention
to the word of Hashem" and left their animals and servants in the fields only
to be killed by the hail. How could there have been Egyptians who were so
reckless and shortsighted as to discount the specific instructions and warnings
of Moshe? After all, Moshe had accurately predicted the previous six plagues
which had devastated the Egyptian people, how then could anyone carelessly
continue to ignore him?</p>

<P>This issue is compounded when we consider
Rashi's deductive assertion (<i>Shemos</i> 9:10), that during the
previous plague of pestilence which had already targeted and eliminated all of the
animals in the fields, those very same Egyptians must have acted to protect
their animals by bringing them indoors. If they sheltered their animals during
the previous plague of pestilence because Moshe informed
them that only the animals in the fields would be affected (<i>Shemos</i> 9, 3),
why wouldn't they take similar precautions and measures before the
plague of hail? Rav Moshe Wolfson (<i>Emunas</i> <i>Itecha</i>) explains that
prior to the plague of pestilence Moshe simply informed the Egyptians of the
potential fallout of the plague (<i>Shemos</i> 9:3) but did not order them
directly to bring their animals indoors. However, prior to the plague of hail
Moshe specifically instructed the Egyptians "gather in your livestock and
all that you have in the field." Moshe's explicit command to bring
the animals inside aroused within the Egyptians an instinctive adverse reaction
to do exactly the opposite of that which Moshe advised them to do. This
prompted the same Egyptians who previously safeguarded their animals during the
plague of pestilence to now leave their animals outside despite the obvious looming
peril of the hail.</p>

<P>We find a similar phenomenon in <i>Parshas Shelach</i>.
The Jewish people initially declined to enter <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> without
first sending <i>miraglim</i>-scouts to survey the land, despite the assurances
and tacit disapproval of Moshe and Hashem. However, at the conclusion of the
episode of the <i>miraglim</i> <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> seem to do a complete about-face.
Now the people insist on entering <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> forthwith, as the <i>passuk</i>
states, "We are ready to go up to the place...for we have sinned" (<i>Bamidbar</i>
14:40). They completely ignore the admonition of Moshe and Hashem "Do not
go up for Hashem is not among you" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 14:42), culminating
in a spectacular defeat at the hands of the people of Amalak and Canaan (<i>Bamidbar</i>
14:44-46). The agenda of <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> is confusing; at the beginning of
the <i>parsha</i> they are hesitant to enter <i>Eretz</i> <i>Yisrael</i> and at
the end of the <i>parsha</i> they are willing to sacrifice themselves fighting
for it. The <i>Alter</i> of Kelm explains that <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> were
primarily and consistently motivated by a desire to defy the orders of Moshe
and Hashem. Therefore, they initially rebuffed Moshe's suggestion to
enter <i>Eretz</i> <i>Yisrael</i> straight away while they subsequently
disregarded his order to stand down.</p>

<p>For this reason, the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i>
31a) tells us that, ironically, one who performs a voluntary <i>mitzvah</i>
receives <u>less</u> reward than one who performs an obligatory <i>mitzvah</i>.
Rav Yaakov Emden contends that this is because even though one who volunteers
to perform a <i>mitzvah</i> has gone beyond his basic obligations, the one who
is commanded to perform a <i>mitzvah</i> has to overcome an additional <i>yezter</i>
<i>hara</i>, namely the evil temptation and inclination to resist obeying
orders. Therefore, one who performs an obligatory <i>mitzvah</i> receives
reward not only for the basic <i>mitzvah</i> but also for displaying the
resolve to adhere to Hashem's commands. The life of a Jew is replete with
divine commands, instructions, and directives, and we should learn from the
damaging and tragic mistakes of the Egyptians and the <i>Mirgalim</i> to
embrace this predicament rather than recoiling from it. In our own lives, we
should aspire to answer the charge of Hashem, not to seize Egyptian silver and
gold, but the treasures of the Torah and the <i>mitzvos</i> which are
infinitely more valuable, as the pasuk tells us, "The instruction of Your mouth is better for me than thousands of gold and silver"
(<i>Tehillim</i> 119:72).</p>

<P>One of the most fundamental assumptions of Torah learning is
that there aren't any superfluous letters, words, or <i>pesukim</i> in
the Torah. Certainly, entire <i>parshiyos</i> are only repeated in order to
teach a crucial lesson. Therefore, the <i>rishonim</i> wonder why the Torah in <i>Parshas</i>
<i>Naso</i> would spend an inordinate amount of time and space itemizing the <i>korbanos</i>
brought by each individual <i>nasi</i> as part of the dedication of the <i>mishkan</i>,
particularly given the fact that all of them brought the identical combination
of sacrifices. The Torah could have conserved many verses by simply stating at
the outset that all twelve of the <i>nesiim</i> brought the following arrangement
of <i>korbanos</i>. Why does the Chumash list all of their <i>korbanos</i> in
such detail again and again? The <i>Ramban</i> suggests that perhaps the Torah
goes to these great lengths in order to honor each individual <i>nasi</i> and
to underscore the significance of their personal contribution. In other words,
all of these <i>pesukim</i> were expended in order to make the <i>nesiim</i>
feel important. This is indeed striking when one considers the fact the Torah
dedicates 89 <i>pesukim</i> in <i>Parshas</i> <i>Naso</i> to its description of
the <i>korbanos</i> of the <i>nesiim</i> while the <i>Aseres HaDibros</i>, the
Ten Commandments, occupy only 36 <i>pesukim</i>, 18 in <i>Parshas</i> <i>Yisro</i>
and 18 in <i>Parshas</i> <i>Vaeschanan</i>! Perhaps the Torah is instructing us
by example that it is appropriate and worthwhile to expend an overabundance of
time talking and conversing with others, even if it is only in order to make
them feel important.</p>

<P>Too often we find ourselves unable to show an interest in
the problems of others because we are ensconced in our own affairs, and this is
indeed a terrible plague. The <i>pasuk</i> states with regards to the plague of
darkness, "They did not see each other, and no one rose from his place
for three days" (<i>Shemos</i> 10:23)<i>.</i> The <i>Chiddushei HaRim</i>
observes that sometimes the greatest plague in life is when people can't
"see each other", when everyone is so focused on their own lives
and problems that they are unable to pause and consider the struggles of
someone else. We must realize that sometimes relief and salvation in our own
lives can only be achieved by looking beyond ourselves to the needs of others.
It is not coincidental that the sequence of events that led to Yosef's redemption
from prison in Egypt only commenced when he removed himself from his own
struggles, and expressed an interest in the state of the baker and butler of
Pharaoh, by asking them, "Why are your faces sad today?" (<i>Breishis</i>
40:7). Similarly, the Torah in <i>Parshas Naso</i> is modeling for us the
imperative of being proactive in cultivating the sensitivity to see beyond our
own activities, to seek out and talk to others, even if it appears to be the
same conversation again and again.</p>

<P>Arguably, there is no trait that is more
"Jewish" than taking the time to inquire and talk to others. In <i>Parshas
Vayishlach</i> the Torah describes how Yaakov was seized upon by "a man"
who "wrestled with him until the break of dawn" (32:25). This
"man" is identified by <i>Chazal</i> as the angel of Esav. However,
in <i>Parshas Vayeishev</i>, Yosef encounters another "man", as the
<i>pasuk</i> states, "a man found him, and behold, he was straying in the
field, and the man asked him, saying, "What are you looking for?"
(37:15.) In this instance, <i>Chazal</i> identify the "man" as the
angel Gavriel. On what basis did Chazal distinguish and determine that the
"man" referred to in <i>Parshas Vayishlach</i> is the angel of Esav,
whereas the "man" mentioned in <i>Parshas Vayeishiv</i> is the
angel Gavriel? The <i>Divrei Chaim</i> claims that it is because in <i>Parshas
Vayishlach</i>, after the conclusion of the battle, Yaakov asked the
"man" for a blessing. The "man" responded, "Let
me go, for dawn is breaking," and <i>Chazal</i> explain that he had no
time to bless Yaakov for he was rushing to praise Hashem in the morning. <i>Chazal</i>
knew that a "man" who couldn't dedicate a moment to talk and
bless someone else must be the angel of Esav. However, in <i>Parshas Vayeishev</i>
the "man" initiated a conversation with Yosef by asking him, "what
are you looking for?" Someone who finds the time to ask after the
wellbeing of others must be an angel of good and not the angel of Esav.</p>

<P>This capacity to converse and connect with others perhaps constitutes
the basis for the entire institution of <i>birchas kohanim</i>, the priestly
blessing, as well. Rav Yosef Albo, in his <i>Sefer Haikrim</i> (4:19) raises
the philosophical dilemma regarding the effectiveness of any blessing received
from a <i>kohen</i>, priest, or <i>tzaddik</i>. If one is inherently worthy than
why is the <i>berachah</i> necessary, and if one is not independently entitled
how does the <i>berachah</i> help? The <i>Sefer</i> <i>Haikrim</i> resolves
that the blessing creates an emotional conduit or bridge between the individual
and the <i>kohen</i>, allowing the recipient to uplift their own personal status
by virtue of their dependence and association with the <i>kohen</i>. It is in
order to establish this benevolent bond that the <i>kohen</i> must extend his
hands towards the recipient whilst bestowing the <i>berachah</i>. The <i>Meor
Vashemesh</i> writes that this intimate affiliation is forged with affection
and love, as is evident from the text of the blessing that the <i>kohen</i>
recites prior to the <i>birchas kohanim</i> which includes the phrase,
"to bless Your nation Israel with love." For this reason, the <i>Magen
Avraham</i> (128:18) cites the <i>Zohar</i> which infers that if the <i>kohen</i>
despises or does not care for his constituents his blessing will also be
ineffective.</p>

<P>How should the <i>kohen</i> go about initially establishing
this loving relationship with the recipient and all of <i>Klal</i> <i>Yisrael</i>
which serves as the backdrop for <i>birchas</i> <i>kohanim</i>? The <i>Meor Vashemesh
</i>continues that the critical ingredient is alluded to in the <i>pasuk</i>
which introduces the topic of <i>birchas</i> <i>kohanim</i>, "<u>Speak</u>
to Aharon and his sons, <u>saying</u>: This is how you shall bless the children
of Israel, <u>saying</u> to them" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 6:23)<i>.</i> The <i>pasuk</i>
stresses the importance of speech numerous times, perhaps intimating that the way
to engender the measure of love necessary for <i>birchas</i> <i>kohanim</i> to
take effect is by speaking to others. If we invest the time to speak to others
and demonstrate a genuine interest in them, we can create the foundation of
empathy and camaraderie that is needed for transmitting and receiving all of
the blessings of Hashem. May we all make the effort to find time in our own
schedule to speak with others and sincerely inquire after their wellbeing, and
thereby merit all of the blessings of <i>birchas kohanim</i> as well as the
ultimate salvation in our own days!</p>

<P>"And these are the generations of Yizchak the
son of Avraham, Avraham begot Yitzchak" (<i>Breishis</i> 25:19). Rashi comments
in the name of the <i>Medrash</i> that the <i>pasuk</i> stresses twice that
Yitzchak was the son of Avraham, because Yitzchak's physical appearance
bore an uncanny resemblance to that of his father Avraham. The <i>Medrash</i>
continues that Yitzchak's likeness to Avraham was ordained deliberately and
miraculously by Hashem in order to dispel the insinuations of the scoffers of
the generation who were murmuring that since Avraham and Sarah had been married
for decades without children, Yitzchok's biological father must have been
Avimelech and not Avraham. This speculation was summarily dismissed when
Yitzchak was born bearing a striking similarity to Avraham, attesting to their
genetic relationship. The <i>meforshim</i> are troubled, why was Hashem so concerned
with the baseless allegations of those who sought to malign and ridicule
Avraham? Rav Mordechai Gifter (<i>Pirkei Torah</i>) suggests that the <i>Medrash
</i>is instructing us regarding the malignant nature of negative speech, mockery,
and derision. Even when it is completely without merit, it can be exceedingly
pernicious and dangerous, to the degree that Hashem had no choice but to quash
it swiftly and overwhelmingly. This is because even one cynical remark can have
devastating and far reaching consequences, whose ripple of effects can
sometimes still be reverberating generations later.</p>

<P>The <i>pasuk</i> states, "And Yaakov gave to
Esav bread and a pottage of lentils, and he ate and drank and arose and left,
and Esav despised the birthright" (<i>Breishis</i> 25:34). The Gemara (<i>Bava
Basra</i> 16b) claims that the five consecutive verbs at the conclusion of the <i>pasuk</i>
are an allusion to five transgressions that Esav performed on that very day: He
engaged in relations with a betrothed maiden, he killed a person, he denied the
existence of Hashem, he denied the resurrection of the dead, and he disparaged
the birthright. However, even though he committed five misdeeds on that same
day, the only <i>aveirah</i> mentioned explicitly in the Torah is that he
denigrated the birthright, which is ostensibly the least egregious sin on the
list. Rav Ahron Kotler explains that this is because Esav's precipitous decline
and all that later ensued was triggered by his one comment besmirching the birthright.
In fact, the <i>Baal Haturim</i> notes that the language "<i>vayivez</i> <i>Esav</i>",
"and Esav disparaged", is only found once more in <i>Tanach</i> in
the <i>pasuk</i> "<i>vayivez be'einav lishloach yad
be'Mordechai levado</i>", "but it seemed
contemptible to him to lay hands on Mordecai alone" (<i>Esther</i> 3:6).
This indicates that Haman's despicable plot to eradicate the Jewish
people centuries later in the times of Esther, can also be attributed to
Haman's ancestor Esav, and his flippant insult of the birthright all
those years ago.</p>

<P>Therefore, just as Hashem protected the reputation of
Avraham and Sarah, we must all vigilantly protect our own reputation from the
potential scoffers of our time. This includes conducting ourselves in a fashion
which is beyond reproach and lacking any possible perception of impropriety. The
<i>Mishnah</i> (<i>Shekalim</i> 3:2) prohibits the treasurer of the <i>Beis</i>
<i>Hamikdash</i> from entering into the vault while wearing clothing, shoes, or
an amulet, that could conceal a potential theft, "lest he become rich and
people say that he became rich from the appropriation of the chamber; for one
must be free of blame before others as he must be free of blame before Hashem,
as it states, 'And you shall be guiltless before Hashem and before
Yisrael' (<i>Bamidbar</i> 32:22)." Similarly, the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Bava</i>
<i>Basra</i> 13a) bars communal collectors of charitable funds from exchanging
small coins with their own private monies, or collectors of food who have
leftovers from purchasing it for themselves. These inherently innocent
activities are proscribed because they can potentially be misconstrued by
others. Rashi (<i>Avodah</i> <i>Zarah</i> 12a) claims that this concern is also
one of the underlying motivations behind the general notion of <i>Maris</i> <i>Ayin</i>,
which prohibits many otherwise permissible actions when they could be reasonably
misinterpreted by an onlooker as inappropriate.</p>

<P>At the same time, the <i>Mishnah</i> (<i>Avos</i> 1:6) enjoins us to judge all people
and situations favorably, and to refrain from looking askance at anyone. If
every ambiguous act should be viewed positively when does <i>Maris Ayin</i>
apply? Why would any onlooker ever be justified in presuming the worst? Rav Chaim
Chizkiyah Medini (<i>Sdei</i> <i>Chemed</i>) explains based upon the rule of
the <i>Mishnah</i> (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 11b) which states
that when a road is generally used exclusively for idol worshipers, it is
prohibited to use the road for any reason, as onlookers will understandably assume
that the tRaveler intends to join the idol worshipers. However, if the same
path leads to a second destination as well, it is permitted to use the road,
and onlookers would be obliged to judge the tRaveler favorably. Therefore, only
when most reasonable and plausible assessments of the situation suggest that a
sin was intended or performed, would the issue of <i>Maris Ayin</i> arise. However,
if <i>Maris Ayin</i> only applies
when the circumstances imply that an <i>aveirah</i> was likely performed, why
must the treasurer of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> or the <i>gabbai</i> <i>tzedakah</i>
be overly cautious when performing their regular duties, which give no
indication whatsoever of nefarious intent?</p>

<p>The Chafetz Chaim resolves that while a private
citizen can depend upon the presumption of innocence, a communal leader who is
in the public sphere must take every possible precaution to avoid suspicion, because
communal figures often can't assume that they will be afforded that same courtesy.
For this reason, the <i>Medrash</i> <i>Tanchuma</i> states that Moshe voluntarily
provided a complete accounting of all of the expenditures involved in the
building of the <i>Mishkan</i>, in order to avoid any potential feelings of
mistrust. In addition, Rav Pam records that while collecting <i>tzedakah</i>, Rav
Yisrael Salanter would not even allow himself to remain secluded in a room together
with someone else's money (see <i>Bava Basra</i> 165a). The Chasam Sofer
once lamented that ironically it is often easier to be found virtuous before
Hashem than in the eyes of Yisrael, however, the <i>chillul</i> <i>Hashem</i> created
by failing to protect our reputation, can sometimes be the gRavest sin of all.
If we take the necessary steps to always conduct ourselves in a fashion that is
beyond reproach, in our individual lives and when conducting activities on
behalf of the community, may Hashem protect us from the potential scoffers of
our time, and enable us to fulfill the mandate of being "guiltless before Hashem and before Yisrael."</p>

<P>The middle, and indeed the bulk, of <i>Parshas Chayei Sara</i>
is devoted to the episode of acquiring a bride for Yitzchak. What could have
been summarized in six or seven <i>pesukim</i> is elaborated by our holy Torah
in sixty seven <i>pesukim</i>. Clearly this devotion to every detail of the
story is there to teach us many lessons to enrich our lives. A primary teaching
that emerges is what to look for in a spouse. Eliezer, whose name is not
mentioned even once, does not use the test of theology, intelligence, or
craftsmanship. Instead, he tests her character, and specifically in the realm
of <i>chesed</i>, to see if she is a giving individual and if she possesses
this <i>middah</i>. Rashi (24:14) explains that this characteristic of <i>chesed</i>
proves her worthiness to continue the legacy of Avraham. The <i>Kli Yakar</i>
cites the <i>Chazal</i> (<i>Ta'anis</i> 24a) who say, "If a bride has
beautiful eyes, one does not have to check the rest of her body," and
explains this to be taken not literally, but rather to mean that her beautiful
eyes describe her <i>ayin yafeh</i> - generous disposition, which is the primary
Torah criterion for marriage.</p>

<P>We are living in very challenging times, perhaps best called
"Generation Me." The individual man or woman is at the center of
his/her own universe. Yes, they have more formal education than previous
generations, but this is accompanied too often with a sense of entitlement. Too
many appear to shun hard work, felling that, "I deserve a great job with a
good salary, but I am not sacrificing my life to do it, and I won't be
subservient to my boss either." They reject tradition on a range of
issues, from dropping all formality in how one dresses to sexual orientation.
Generation Me is less interested in how it's been done in the past and more
interested in how and what works best for them. It is thus painfully
understandable that the divorce rate in the United States is approximately
40-50% according to the American Psychological Association. When "Me"
is the primary factor which is focused on, then the joining together of two
individuals who by nature are different is unnatural, hence the divorce
statistics.</p>

<P>Dovid <i>HaMelech</i> (<i>Tehillim</i> 111:8) teaches,
"<i>smuchim la'ad l'olam, asuyim b'emet v'yashar</i> - they (the laws and
values of Torah) are steadfast forever, for eternity, accomplished in truth and
fairness." The Malbim understands this verse literally, i.e. to mean that
the Torah are pillars of eternal strength and principles upon which we build
our homes and society.</p>

<P>Many years ago I was privileged to hear a shiur from the Rav
<i>z"tl</i> where he spoke not only of the laws of Torah being eternal,
but also the values and psychological insights of <i>Chazal</i> being equally
binding and as correct today as when they were enunciated 2000 years ago. He
gave the example of the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 42a) which says, "<i>tav
l'meisav tan du mil'meisav armalo</i> - it is better to sit together as a
couple than to sit alone like a widow", i.e. a woman would prefer to have
a husband with non-trivial imperfections than to be alone. The Rav noted that
most often the teachings of <i>Chazal</i> and their insight into the nature of
man are part of the same source of <i>smuchim la'ad l'olam</i>.</p>

<P>It is fascinating to note that in our <i>mesorah</i> and <i>hashkafa</i>
the <i>ani</i>-me is also at the center of one's universe, but with a different
definition of <i>ani</i>-me. The Chazon Ish <i>z"tl</i> (<i>Emunah
U'Bitachon</i> 4:14) as well as Rav Shimon Shkop (introduction to <i>Sha'arei
Yosher</i>), both point to <i>ahavas atzmi</i> (self-love) as a legitimate
priority. After all, Rav Akiva taught (<i>Bava Metziah</i> 62a) that, "your
life takes priority", and Hillel taught, (<i>Avos</i> 1:14) "if I
am not for myself who will take care of me?" However, both of these
giants say that the definition of <i>ani</i>-me is different in <i>Yahadus</i>.
Unlike the Generation Me that runs on "what's in it for me," <i>Yahadus</i>
espouses that the real me is a giver, concerned and caring for the needs of
others. The Medrash (<i>Rus Rabbah </i>2:19) teaches, "more than what the
rich man does for the poor man, does the poor man do for the rich man", since
he transforms the rich man into a giver.</p>

<P>In addition, this is a fulfillment of the six hundred and eleventh
<i>mitzvah</i> in the Torah of "<i>v'halachta b'drachav</i> - emulate the
ways and characteristics of Hashem." The <i>Talmud</i> (<i>Sotah</i> 14a)
understands this to mean, "just as He is kind and merciful and a
practitioner of <i>chesed</i>, so are we to be." Taking it one step
further, the <i>chesed</i> that one performs is not only a <i>mitzvah</i> between
two people, but since (as the <i>Mekubalim</i> teach) Hashem created this world
because it is the nature of the Good One to extend goodness, when one extends <i>chesed</i>
they are joining ranks with Hashem and becoming a partner with Him in fulfilling
and implementing His will.</p>

<P>Finally, Rav Chaim Vital <i>z"tl</i> (<i>Sefer
Halikutim</i>,<i> Parshas Eikev</i> chapter 8) notes that if taken literally, the
<i>mitzvah</i> to love your fellow as yourself is, for all practical purposes, impossible.
For this reason when a potential convert asked Hillel to summarize the entire
Torah in the short amount of time during which one can stand on one foot, Hillel
replied, "do not to another that which is distasteful to you."
However, says Rav Chaim, marriage <b><u>is</u></b> that opportunity for
fulfilling this exalted <i>mitzvah</i> of the Torah literally, since each
spouse can extend <i>chesed</i> to the other 24/7. Probably the most famous
line in the entire biography of Rav Aryeh Levin <i>z"tl</i> (<a
href="http://www.feldheim.com/a-tzaddik-in-our-time.html">A <i>Tzaddik</i> In
Our Time</a>) is that when he accompanied his wife to see a doctor for a foot
ache he informed the doctor, "<u>OUR</u> foot hurts." The Torah
spends sixty seven <i>pesukim</i> to teach us not only what made Rivka the
worthy choice for Yitzchak, but also to teach us about a most important factor
for us to consider in our perpetuating our holy tradition.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: chukas]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>One of the most challenging incidents in the entire Torah,
and perhaps most appropriately in <i>Parshas Chukas</i>, which begins "<i>zos
chukas haTorah</i> - this is the law that is beyond human reason and
comprehension", is <i>mei-merivah</i>, i.e. Moshe's sin at the
rock. Just as we cannot understand the laws of the <i>parah adumah</i> (the red
heifer), similarly we cannot understand how Moshe who "In My entire house
he is the trusted one" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 12:7) could disobey Hashem. The <i>Ohr
HaChaim Hakadosh</i> lists no less than ten possible explanations as to what
was Moshe's sin, from the opinion of Rashi that he hit the rock instead
of speaking to it to that of the <i>Ma'asei</i> Hashem, that Moshe and
the Jewish people differed as to which rock should be addressed, the nation
having dug out and selected a different rock location, and Moshe in anger at
the people threw his staff which hit the rock and water emerged.</p>

<P>I'd like to focus on the opinion of the Ramban who
concurs with <i>Rabbeinu</i> Chananel that Moshe's sin was that he and
Aharon said to the people (20:10) "Shall we bring forth water for you
from this rock?" They said the word "<i>notzi</i>" which
means literally "we shall bring forth", giving the impression that
they, with their knowledge and capabilities, will produce the water. They
should have used the word "<i>yotzi</i>" which clearly means that
He (referring to Hashem) will perform the miracle, as indeed Moshe said (<i>Shemos</i>
16:8) "in the evening Hashem gives you meat to eat, and bread to satiate
in the morning."</p>

<P>It is thus understandable, continues the Ramban, that where
Hashem clearly announces why Moshe does not enter the promised land (<i>Devarim</i>
32:51), He enumerates two wrong doings: 1) "<i>Asher m'altem bee</i>"
literally you trespassed against Me or the sin of <i>m'ilah</i>, and 2)
"<i>Lo kidashtem osi</i>" - you did not sanctify me among the
children of Israel.</p>

<P>The Ramban notes, that what transpired here was assessed by
Hashem to be an act of <i>m'ilah</i>. <i>M'ilah</i> is misuse-abuse
of sanctified property, most often associated with misuse of the <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i>, its possessions, and <i>karbanos</i>. The Ramban is broadening
the horizon and definition of <i>m'ilah</i>. Moshe had an incredible
opportunity. The Torah (20:10) informs us that Moshe and Aharon "gathered
the congregation before the rock." Rashi cites the <i>medrash</i> (<i>Vayikra
Rabbah</i> 10:9) that the entire nation, literally millions of people, were
able to miraculously stand in front of the rock to see and hear the
proceedings. Thus, in this environment Moshe's use of "<i>notzi</i>"
rather than "<i>yotzi</i>" was a form of <i>m'ilah</i>,
taking the credit and honor that was due Hashem and on some level attributing
the success to himself and Aharon. The absence of a great <i>kiddush</i> Hashem
- sanctification of Hashem's name was thus a <i>chilul</i> Hashem on
Moshe's level on their part.</p>

<P>What emerges from these few terse words of the Ramban is
that the entire world is His stage, and man constantly has the opportunity to
either bring honor, or the antithesis, to His name. The Talmud (<i>Brachos</i> 35a)
teaches "it is forbidden for a person to derive benefit from this world
without first reciting a <i>bracha</i> and whoever derives benefit from this
world without first reciting a <i>bracha</i> - <i>ma'al</i>." <I>Ma'al</I> means he has committed
an act of <i>m'ilah</i>, i.e. stealing from the Holy, the unauthorized
use of His property, as indeed we are taught (<i>Tehillim</i> 24:1) "to
Hashem belongs the Earth and its fullness."</p>

<P>The difference between eating with or without a <i>bracha</i>
might be compared to "<i>notzi</i>" vs. "<i>yotzi</i>".
With a blessing, one is acknowledging that <i>she-hakol</i>, everything and
every aspect of this nourishment came about only through His directive and
involvement. True, man is involved with sowing and harvesting and baking, still
one admits with a blessing that He (<i>Devarim</i> 8:18), "gives you
strength to make wealth," which is understood by Targum Unkelus to mean, "He
gives you the intelligence and ideas to succeed and progress." Without
the recitation of a <i>bracha</i> it is "<i>notzi</i>", man is
ascribing too much to himself and his involvement.</p>

<P>The recitation of <i>brachos</i> is not only simply a <i>matir</i>
- enabling one to rightfully enjoy their food, but a personal religious
encounter acknowledging His presence and participation in all we do.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>In <i>Parshas Emor</i> we not only read about <i>sefiras
ha'omer</i>, but we are in the middle of its observance. The Ramban, (<i>Vayikra</i>
23:36) teaches that from the Torah the days between <i>Pesach</i> and <i>Shavuos</i>
are understandably happy days; these are days of anticipation, yearning and
excitement. We are counting from our liberation to relive the moment of His
revelation to an entire nation, something which was and is unprecedented in the
annals of world history. Our Ravs remind us (Rashi, <i>Breishis</i> 1:1) that
the very purpose of creation was for the giving of the Torah.</p>

<P>The Talmud (<i>Yevamos</i> 62b) teaches that the
twenty four thousand students of Rav Akiva died during this period of <i>sefiras
ha'omer</i>, and for this reason the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach
Chaim</i> 493:1-2) legislates some mournful observances, including no weddings
and haircuts during thirty three days of the <i>omer</i>. The cause of their
dying is given as "<i>lo nahagu kavod zeh lazaeh</i> - they did not show
adequate respect for one another." The <i>Mesilas Yesharim</i> (chapter
22) takes this most literally, accusing them of a lack of <i>derech-eretz,
mentchlechkeit</i>, which is a pre-requisite for Torah as taught by our Ravs
"<i>derech-eretz kadma la'Torah</i>." This is found as well in
<i>Avos</i> (3:17) where Rav Elazar <i>ben</i> Azariyah taught, "if
there is no respect, there is no Torah" and <i>Rabbeinu</i> Yonah teaches
that one has to refine their character as a pre-requisite for Torah.</p>

<P>The Maharsha understands this deficiency to be specifically
in the realm of <i>Talmud</i> Torah. Instead of praising one another for their
unique understanding, contribution, and <i>chelek</i>-portion in Torah, they
viewed the other as a threat and competition to their individual self-worth.</p>

<P>I'd like to suggest an explanation of their lack of <i>kavod</i>
- respect one to another, based upon the teaching of the <i>Shem MiShmuel</i>.
He is bothered, as are we, by the following: how is it possible that the
students of Rav Akiva, who not only heard the teaching of their great Rav
that <i>v'ahavta l'reyacha</i> <i>kamocha</i> is a fundamental
principle of the Torah, but were students of Rav Akiva who lived and
personified this teaching as well. The Talmud (<i>Shabbos</i> 127b) describes
the extraordinary character of a worker and the <i>Sheiltos</i> (<i>Parshas
Shemos</i>) ascribes this story to Rav Akiva. How is it possible that they
would be deficient in this area?</p>

<P>The <i>Shem MiShmuel</i> answers that there is a significant
difference between love and respect. Love is an emotion that most often emerges
from and pervades a natural organism. There is love within the family unit as
they are just that, a unit. Love stems from the commonality that individuals
share together. Thus, the students of Rav Akiva followed the sacred teaching
of their <i>rebbe</i> and loved all Jews. The Jewish people share a common
pedigree, history and destiny, all of which contribute to unite them and, in
addition, the Torah commands them to love one another.</p>

<P>Respect on the other hand emerges not from commonality, but
the reverse; one notices the unique features that marks someone's
individuality and admires these positive traits and consciously or subconsciously
desires to emulate these qualities. In order for respect to emerge and prevail,
one must note how a person is different and shines above the others in this
particular realm. The students of Rav Akiva followed their teacher and his
teaching to a fault. Their intense love for every Jew led them to relax any and
all formality, and they viewed each <i>talmid </i>as being on par with all the
other <i>talmidim</i>. This caused them to overlook the unique strengths of
each, thus missing the opportunity 1) to develop a desire to emulate that
uniqueness and thereby be driven to grow and 2) for individual recognition and
respect to emerge.</p>

<P>Note that the Torah in the fifth of the <i>Aseres Hadibors</i>
does not legislate loving a parent because it is natural to love a parent. The
Torah does however command a child to respect a parent, for often the child
will not necessarily adopt the same ideologies and lifestyle, but the child is
to respect his parents' unique traits. </p>

<P>The students of Rav Akiva failed to recognize and learn
from each other. Sad to say, we repeat the tragic mistakes of our past.
Ideally, we too love all Jews, and this is the easy part. However, even within
the Orthodox community, there are the divisions of modern, <i>yeshivish</i> and
<i>chasidish</i>, and too often we might love them all and yet fail to
sufficiently note and implement the many noble and distinguishing character
traits of the other groups. Our instinctive, immediate dismissal of their
identifying outer trappings too often preclude us from considering and
incorporating their many positive virtues. This might well be characterized as
"<i>lo nahagu kavod zeh lazeh</i>", as not showing respect one for
another.</p>

<P>The same page of Talmud that condemns the students of Rav
Akiva continues and presents the ideals of marriage. A husband is to
"love his wife as himself, and respect her more than himself". This
is precisely what the <i>Shem MiShmuel</i> has been teaching. The couple shares
love as a single unit, but must respect the distinguishing traits of their
spouse. </p>

<P>Reb Elimelech of Lizhensk, one of the outstanding Chassidic
leaders of the eighteen century, was wont to pray that we should see,
appreciate, and emulate the worth of others, thereby not only loving them as
part of <i>Klal</i> <i>Yisroel</i>, but also respecting them for their
individuality. May we follow in his footsteps in both prayer and deed.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Who is at the center of one's universe? This intriguing
question has a most profound effect on one's life and destiny. The Chovos
Halevavos reminds us that if one has Hashem as the center, what naturally
follows is a <i>hakoras hatov</i> - recognition and appreciation of all the
good that He does on one's behalf. His taking us out of Egypt is not just a
monumental moment in our history, but obligates us and provides us with the
privilege to reciprocate to Him; we owe Him. "<i>Kol haneshama t'hallel
Kah, Hallelukah</i>" (Tehillim 150:6) is to be understood not only that
each individual praises Him, but also that we owe him a debt of gratitude for
each and every breath that we are fortunate to breathe. If He is absent from
that center, but man himself is there, then man can live a most arrogant
lifestyle with the attitude that everything is coming to him and he owes
nothing to anybody.</p>

<P>The Torah informs us that man was created in the image of
G-d (<i>Bereishis</i> 1:27) which, among other meanings, indicates man's
ability to emulate his Maker. Indeed, in the 611th <i>mitzvah</i> of
"v'halachta b'drachav" (<i>Devarim</i> 28:9) man is commanded to
emulate Hashem. The Torah tells us that in the beginning of creation, all
vegetation and herbage was created but had not yet sprouted, "for
Hashem had not yet sent rain upon the Earth, and there was no man to work the
soil" (<i>Bereishis</i> 2:5.) Rashi cites the <i>Talmud</i> (<i>Chulin</i>
60b) that Hashem waited for man to realize the requirement for rain in order for
vegetation to grow, and thus to be appreciative of the rain. Hashem's first
lesson to Adam was to be a <i>makir tov</i> - someone who is appreciative
of the good bestowed upon him. Indeed, the Maharal (in his Gur Aryeh) adds,
"it is forbidden to extend goodness to one who does not appreciate
it." Moreover, based on this Maharal one can derive a deeper meaning of
the verse "<i>lo tov heyos ha'adam l'vado</i> - it is not good that man be
alone" (<i>Bereishis</i> 2:18.) A deeper understanding of this <i>possuk</i>
is that he cannot be <i>tov</i> - good if he has no one to extend goodness to.
Thus, <i>Ksav V'halkabalah</i> explains that when the Torah repeats, "and
Hashem saw that it was good" throughout creation it is not that Hashem was
glowing and bragging in self aggrandizement over His accomplishment, but rather
Hashem saw that His creation could be shared and thus extend goodness to
others, namely mankind.</p>

<P>Indeed, the Ramban (<i>Bamidbar</i> 7:2-5) notes that Hashem
was <i>makir tov</i> to the <i>nesi'im</i> on the occasion of the dedication of
the <i>Mishkan</i>. Why was it necessary to repeat the identical offering of
each of the twelve prince times when the Torah could have stated it once and
informed us that each of the twelve offered it? The Ramban answers that it was
Hashem's way of saying thank you to each <i>nasi</i> for not trying to outdo
and exceed the offering of the previous day. Since they all conformed in
modesty and extended dignity to each other, Hashem thus responded in kind and
showed <i>hakaras hatov</i> to each <i>nasi</i>.</p>

<P>It is interesting to note, that on the very opening word of
the Torah, "<i>Bereishis</i>", the commentaries see not only the
dimension of when, but why. For what reason did Hashem create the world? Rashi
cites <i>Chazal</i>'s explanation that it was created for the Torah and
for <i>Bnei Yisroel</i>, both of which are called "<i>reishis</i>".
The Ravs (<i>Medrash Yalkut Shimoni</i>,<i> Bereishis</i> 1:2) add the third
understanding that is for <i>bikurim</i>, the <i>mitzvah</i> of bringing the
first fruits to the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> accompanied by the recitation of a
paragraph of thanksgiving to Hashem. Of all the <i>mitzvos</i> in the Torah,
why single out <i>bikurim</i> as a reason for creation? The answer, as many of
our <i>mussar</i> teachers note, is to impress upon us from the very first word
of the Torah the centrality of <i>hakaras hatov</i>, specifically as applied to
expressing our thanks to Hashem. </p>

<P>Indeed, our very name "<i>Yehudim</i>", commonly
translated as "Jews", in reality stems from Yehuda whose birth was
accompanied by his mother's appreciation of the kindness and generosity of
Hashem (<i>Bereishis</i> 29:35.) Moreover, the <i>mishnah</i> (<i>Berachos</i> 54a)
teaches that one is to be "<i>modeh al ha'avar v'tzoek al heated </i>- grateful
and thankful for the past, and pray with fervor for the future." Built
into our spiritual DNA is the obligation for ethical behavior, namely to be humble,
to take note and realize that we could not do it alone, and to therefore show
gratitude for all who help us in any way. </p>

<P>While the <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> at the beginning of the Book
of Vayikra lists nine other names that Moshe had, the name "Moshe"
is the only name used in the Torah for the greatest of the prophets. This name
is the one that expresses gratitude to the Egyptian princess who saved his
life.</p>

<P>It is thus most understandable that included in <i>parshas</i>
<i>Ki Teitzei,</i> with its seventy four <i>mitzvos</i>, is the prohibition of
allowing a male member of Ammon and Moav from marrying into the Jewish nation.
The Torah states (23:5), "because of the fact that they did not greet you
with bread and water on the road when you were leaving Egypt, and because he
hired against you Bilam to curse you." At first glance this seems like a
rather harsh response to their lack of hospitality. However, it goes much
deeper on two levels. Firstly, these two nations are descendants of Lot,
Avraham's nephew. The Torah states explicitly, "Thus it was that, when God
destroyed the cities of the Plain and annihilated the cities where Lot dwelt,
God was mindful of Abraham and removed Lot from the midst of the upheaval"
(<i>Bereishis</i> 19:29.) Rashi cites the Medrash that Hashem rewarded Lot for
his silence in Egypt, when Avraham told the authorities that Sara was his
sister (12:13) and he, Lot, knew the truth but not contradict and betray his
uncle. Hashem recognized the good that Lot had done and saved him. When the
male descendants of Lot who refused to be hospitable to a nation, indeed a
relative, that had been persecuted in Egypt, this revealed a character flaw of
such great significance that the Torah forbade our marrying these men. In
addition, note that Lot had the trait of keeping silent, and had learned from
his uncle <i>hachnasas orchim</i> - hospitality. Yet his very progeny betrayed
him on both accounts. Moav hired Bilam to curse the Jewish people and Ammon was
inhospitable.</p>

<P>Why does Avraham sent Eliezer to find a wife for Yitzchak
and Avraham does not choose a daughter of one of the thousands of his
disciples? The Ran (Drashos HaRan <i>drasha</i> 5<i>)</i> explains that it is
relatively easy to change a person's thinking and perspective, their <i>dei'os</i>,
and thus remove idolatry from their mindset. It is, however, most challenging
and difficult to change a person's <i>middos</i> - character traits. The people
of Cannan were of vile character. The Torah is thus teaching us what to look
for in a bride, i.e. someone who is selfless rather than someone who is
selfish.</p>

<P>The trait of being <i>makir tov</i>, acknowledging the good
performed on your behalf, leads to a greater degree of happiness in life.
Perhaps this is so because one lives without a sense of entitlement, as Yaakov
states, "<i>katonti mikal hachasadim</i>...<i>asher asisa es avdecha</i> -
I am diminished and overwhelmed by all the kindnesses... that You have done on
behalf of your servant" (<i>Bereishis</i> 32:11.) and therefore one is
truly grateful for whatever comes his way. Moreover, <i>hakaras hatov</i>
empowers. Rav Chaim Shmuelevitz (<i>Sichos Mussar</i> 32:32) notes that Eliyahu
<i>Hanavi</i> and Elisha, his disciple, both performed the miracle of <i>techiyas
hameiseim</i> - resurrecting the dead, and yet didn't revive their parents
and/or other loved ones. Rav Shmuelevitz explains that they each, having
been the recipient of generous hospitality, were enabled by their great sense
of gratitude, true <i>hakaras hatov</i>, to revive the respective young men. In
the not too distant days of <i>aseres yemei teshuva</i> we will recite in every
<i>shemoneh esrei</i>, "<i>zachreinu l'chaim</i>", asking Hashem to
remember us for life. May we be able to honestly say that we have utilized the
gift of life until now to serve Hashem and his people and thus be able to ask
for an extension of His beneficence.</p>

<P>The <i>gemara</i> (<i>Bava Kama</i> 92b) teaches, "the
wine belongs to the host, yet we say thank you to the waiter who pours the
wine." Why do we thank the waiter? I believe the <i>Talmud</i> is
teaching us that we are to be individuals who acknowledge the benefits bestowed
upon us by others. Rather than rationalizing to ourselves, "after all,
it's not his wine, and he's being paid to wait on me", we are
to express gratitude. Similarly, regarding our parents, we did not ask to be
born and yet we are to ever acknowledge the good they did, and do, for us. The
same is true regarding one's spouse. A husband might be the breadwinner
in the family, but his wife deserves the proper recognition and respect for the
environment she creates in the home. After all is said and done, <i>hakoras
hatov</i> may be even more important for our character refinement than it is to
the provider of the service.</p>

<P>If clothes do not make the man
they certainly influence the man. A policeman who dons his uniform consciously
or not is donning upon himself not only specific and unique garments that
identify his profession, but responsibility and commitment to others. This is
one of the many items on the long list of "we had it first" ideas
that the Torah teaches. The <i>Kohanim</i> in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, we are
taught in <i>Parshas Tetzaveh</i>, wore special garments, "<i>l'chavod
u'l'sifares</i> - for honor and splendor" (<i>Shemos</i> 28:2). At first
glance this is to be understood as honor for the One they served, and honor for
the House in which they served. Indeed, this is the way the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>
(99) understands this <i>mitzvah</i>. I'd like to suggest however, that in
addition these special garments, unique to the <i>Kohanim</i>, brought out <b>their</b>
honor and splendor.</p>

<P>The <i>Ibn Ezra</i> in his
interpretation of the <i>l'chavod u'l'sifares</i> notes, "<i>sheyisparau
bahem</i> - that their honor may be revealed through them." Rashi famously
comments regarding Aharon's lighting of the menorah, (<i>Bamidbar</i> 8:3) "<i>melamed
shelo shina</i> - this teaches us that he did not deviate." The Sfas Emes
<i>z"tl</i> understands this to mean he did not deviate from his initial
excitement and commitment; the privilege of lighting the <i>menorah</i> never
became a routine matter. Perhaps his donning of the priestly garments which, as
the Ramban notes, reflected royalty, assisted him in maintaining his incredible
focus. Indeed, Reb Yochanan referred to his garments as, "<i>m'chabdusai
-</i>that which honors me" (<i>Shabbos</i> 113a.)</p>

<P>Clothing plays a most important
role in the Sanctuary, as we are taught, "while clad in Priestly garments
their <i>Kehuna</i> responsibilities and effectiveness as officiating is
valid" (<i>Zevachim</i> 17b); without the exact prescribed attire of the
Kohen, they are no better than a <i>zar</i> (a non-Kohen) and their service
would be invalidated.</p>

<P>An additional appreciation of
clothing may be learned from the laws of <i>Shabbos</i> and <i>Yom</i> Tov
attire. The Talmud (<i>Shabbos</i> 113a) teaches that one's garments for
Shabbos should be better and different than those worn during the week, and if
possible one's attire for Yom Tov should be even of a better class. A possible
reason for this was explained by the Rav <i>z"tl</i>, that on Shabbos
Hashem comes to visit us and we dress accordingly. On Yom Tov when we go to
visit Him, if possible we upgrade the clothes to mark the specialty of the
occasion. Here too our donning Shabbos and Yom Tov clothing brings out a
greater respect and appreciation for Shabbos, and in turn elevates our persona
on these holy days. </p>

<P>It is interesting to note that
regarding the forthcoming holiday of Purim there is an old custom to masquerade
in costumes and conceal our true identity. The <i>B'nei Yissaschar</i> in <i>Ma'amarei
Chodesh Adar</i> (9) suggests the following explanation for the custom: the <i>Gemara</i>
(<i>Megillah</i> 12a) teaches that the Jews were guilty of bowing down to the
statue of Nevuchadnetzar, but they only sinned on the surface. That is to say,
they feigned serving the idol, while in their hearts they remained loyal to
Hashem. Hashem acted <i>midah k'neged midah</i> and therefore feigned a threat
to (G-d forbid) destroy the Jewish nation in order to scare and arouse the
Jewish nation to <i>teshuva</i>; there never was a Divine plot to destroy His
people. We therefore masquerade at the time of the <i>Purim Seudah</i>, thus
demonstrating and proclaiming the message that we need to learn from, and
rectify, the past. They failed to have their inner resolve prevail over their
actions; their <i>penimius</i> did not influence their <i>chitzonius</i>.</p>

<P>Purim was a day of <i>v'nahafoch
hu</i> - topsy-turvy, and what appears on the surface was not genuine. The
Talmud (<i>Megillah</i> 12a) teaches that King Achashveirosh, to celebrate that
the Jews would not be rebuilding their Temple nor returning to their land, clad
himself in the <i>bigdei Kehuna</i> to defiantly mock the Jews by saying they
would no longer be needing these garments.</p>

<P>The Jew relives his past, he does
not only remember it. It is not enough to recall that those who left Egypt ate <i>matzah</i>,
rather we also eat <i>matzah</i>. We remain awake all night on <i>Shavuos</i>,
anxiously awaiting our receiving the Torah. We reside in <i>Sukkos</i>. It is
thus most appropriate that we masquerade on Purim, laughing at and mocking the
outer trappings and behavior of the another individual, and thereby reminding
ourselves that the <i>penimius</i>, i.e. the inner core, commitment, and image
of G-d and true character is what saved the Jewish nation at Purim, and
reminding us that this is to be our true perspective and identity all year
long.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vayigash]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Now that Chanukah is behind us, I'd like to begin with
a thought that continues its theme into <i>Parshas Vayigash</i>. The
B'nei Yissaschar notes that the four letters on the dreidel do not only
spell "<i>neis gadol haya sham</i> - a great miracle occurred there",
it also spells Goshna - meaning to Goshen, the city that Yaakov chose for his
family to live when they went into exile in Egypt. Yaakov wanted a strong
cohesive Jewish community with its own resources and educational system,
enabling survival for the Jew in exile. Thus, we read (<i>Bereishis</i> 46:28)
"He sent Judah before him, to instruct ahead of him in Goshen."
Rashi cites from the <i>Medrash Tanchuma</i> that Yehuda was to establish a
house of study. Thus on Chanukah, when our Jewish identity was threatened by
the Greeks, one of the messages of the dreidel was that especially in <i>galus</i>
we must realize the importance of a Jewish community.</p>

<P>This Sunday is the fast of the tenth of Teves. We are taught
(<i>Melachim</i> 2 25:1) that "in the ninth year of the reign of King
Tzidkiyahu on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nevuchadnetzer, King of Bavel,
put a siege around Jerusalem." This marked the beginning of the end of
the first<i> Beis Hamikdash</i>. The Prophet Yechezkel (24:1) was in Bavel at
the time, and without CNN or any way to be informed he told the people in Bavel
"record this date, this exact day, for this very day the King of Babylon
has laid siege to Jerusalem." The Avudraham (a <i>Rishon</i>), in his
commentary on the <i>siddur</i> teaches that were the fast of <i>Asara
B'Teves</i> to fall on a Shabbos, we would fast on Shabbos. The reason
being since the Prophet used the words "<i>b'etzem hayom hazeh</i> -
on this very day" regarding <i>Asara B'Teves</i>, just as is found
regarding Yom Kippur (<i>Vayikra</i> 23:29), and if Yom Kippur comes out on Shabbos
we fast, so too would be the <i>din</i> if <i>Asara B'Teves</i> came out
on Shabbos. Our calendar has been established in such a way that while this
fast can occur on a Friday and indeed we fast then, it cannot fall on a
Shabbos.</p>

<P>The Chasam Sofer <i>z"tl</i>, in his commentary on <i>Selichos</i>
for <i>Asara B'Teves</i>, gives a fascinating reason we would fast on
Shabbos. He quotes from the <i>Sefer Karnayim</i> (a Kabbalistic work) that on
that tenth of Teves that the siege was laid, the Heavenly Court was convened
and it was determined on that day that the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> would be
destroyed. Subsequently, every year on the tenth of Teves, the Heavenly High
Court is called into session to determine if the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> will be
rebuilt this year. Thus we are not only fasting to relive a significant moment
in our historical past, but a crisis that is facing us in the immediate
present.</p>

<P>The Chasam Sofer continues that if one has a practice to
fast on a <i>yahrzeit</i> and it falls on a Shabbos, one would not fast since
that is <i>aveilus yeshana</i> - a day of mourning marking an event of the
past. However, if one has a most disturbing dream on a Friday night he is
permitted to fast on Shabbos as that is considered an <i>aveilus chadasha</i> -
a day of mourning for the present. It is for this reason that were <i>Asara
B'Teves</i> to fall on a Shabbos we would fast, since its consequences
reflect a current crisis.</p>

<P>The Talmud (<i>Megillah</i> 29a) teaches that Yechezkel (11:16)
charged the Jewish nation that even after the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> is
destroyed, "though I have removed them far away among the nations, and
though I have scattered them among the lands, yet I have been for them a small
sanctuary in the lands where they arrived." Even in the darkest exile the
Jew can find the <i>Shechinah</i> - Divine Presence in their <i>mikdash
me'at</i>, their synagogues and study halls. Moreover, the Bach in his
commentary on <i>Hilchos</i> Chanukah writes that because the Jewish people at
that time did not properly honor and revere the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> they lost
it. The upshot and lesson is most charging, namely, for us to petition the
return and rebuilding of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> we must demonstrate our
appreciation and respect for the <i>mikdash me'at</i>.</p>

<P>I truly believe that if we show how much we appreciate and
revere our <i>mikdash me'at</i> then we can petition an upgrade. To say
that one is not to talk during davening is but half a statement. The law states
(<i>Orach Chaim</i> 151:1) that one is not to speak "<i>devarim beteilim</i>
- small talk" in shul, even when davening is over. If one is interested
in buying his neighbor's car he should arrange, "I'll meet
you in shul for mincha and ma'ariv", meaning in the lobby, a
meeting room, but not in the sanctuary, even if it is not during davening. Some
Rabbanim over the years were reluctant or refused to perform a marriage
ceremony in the shul sanctuary. In addition, if one has to enter the shul to
either call someone out or deliver a message, unless it is a medical emergency,
they should first sit down, recite either a verse or halachic teaching and only
then deliver the message. In his introduction to his <i>sefer</i> Chofetz
Chaim, he cites the Yereyim and other <i>Rishonim</i> that the Biblical <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>morah hamikdash </i>(<i>Vayikra</i> 26:2) applies today to our <i>mikdash
me'at</i>.</p>

<P>I strongly recommend that just as many have the practice of
knocking on the door of their home before entering, allowing them not to
startle the ones inside, but more importantly to pause and reflect upon the
privilege of entering one's home, and not bringing any negativity of the
day into the home. Similarly, before one enters the sanctuary they should pause
and say <i>ma tovu</i>, how privileged I am to enter your sanctuary.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>There is a famous parable for Elul which compares it to a king strolling in his field, at which time anyone can approach him. This <i>moshol </i>is quoted as if it were a <i>midrash</i>;
but in fact it is not. [There is a <i>midrash</i> that the Tur brings about a group of people preempting the king, by coming to him while he's tRavelling, but its intent is quite different.]. The true source of this <i>moshol</i> is the Baal Hatanya [<i>Likutei Torah Reeh</i>].</p>

<P>On the surface of it, the parable seems to not have much content. It is simply a somewhat vague metaphor for having easier access to the king. Why should we have easier access? Why <b>don't we</b> have to make an appointment with the king at his palace? What prompted the royal stroll in his field?</p>

<P>Let us take a closer look at the Baal Hatanya's words:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>"Why are the <i>yud gimmel middos</i> revealed during Elul, though they are a very lofty revelation suitable primarily for Yom Kippur? One can compare it to a king
who, before he arrives in the town, is accessible to everyone and is friendly with them. When the king proceeds to the city, <b>they then follow him</b>. Once he is in his palace they need permission to enter..."</p> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I think that the words "they then follow him" are crucial to understand the <i>moshol</i>. Although one needs special permission to enter the palace, poor peasants are so far removed from the refinement of the monarchy that they lack any interest in even making an appointment to see the king. What does the king do to give them an inkling of what it means to meet him? He extends himself undeservedly to them, so that they gain some sense of what he is. When their interest is aroused, and their passions are excited, they follow the king to his palace. And now they must deserve to enter.</p>

<P>If you wish, this is actually a <i>passuk</i> in <i>Shir Hashirim</i>. In the fifth <i>perek</i> there is a description of the king's beloved having become tired of the king. He begs her to open the door, and she replies that she is tired and has gone to sleep. He then puts his hand through the keyhole, and she begins to yearn for him. But by that point he is gone, and she must spend the rest of her time pursuing him.</p>

<P>Hashem's availability in Elul has the same dynamic. A beloved has lost interest, and unless that interest is aroused again, she/he will never even bother to pursue the king. The Baal Hatanya's parable teaches us that in order for the process of <i>din</i> to be meaningful, a desire must first be aroused in the populace to achieve closeness to Hashem. Thus, Elul is a time when Hashem grants us an undeserved rush of spirituality. This is not real spirituality which can be achvied only through effort. This undeserved spirituality is meant to draw us out of our beds of comfort, and to entice us to begin following the king to his palace. Once we reach the palace, i.e. Yom Kippur, we must show ourselves deserving.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: parah]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Koheles (7:29) notes "indeed Hashem created man <i>yashar</i>
- perfectly upright, but they sought many intrigues." The Chasid Yaavitz,
in his commentary on <i>Avos</i> (5:7) which lists the 10 miracles that
occurred in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, asks why did Hashem need to display open
miracles? He suggests a most intriguing answer, namely to demonstrate that
ideally there is a perfect harmony between Torah, man and nature.</p>

<P>In Chapter 2 of <i>Breishis</i> we read of the Garden of
Eden that Hashem planted in this world. The Medrash presents a utopian
existence in that environment, whereby man's spiritual existence is
primary and his physical necessities are cared for from On High. Lest one doubt
the feasibility and reality of such an existence, the supernatural miracles
present in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> on a constant basis was a clear reminder
of that perfect harmony between Torah and nature. When the Torah commands (<i>Vayikra</i>
6:6) that "the fires on the Altar shall remain aflame, it shall not be
extinguished," nature responds in kind, and a heavy downfall of rain does
not extinguish the fires on the <i>mizbeyach</i>.</p>

<P>After Cain kills Hevel, Cain is afraid for his life and
exclaims, "whomever meets me will kill me" (<i>Breishis</i> 4:14.)
Who, you might ask, is Cain afraid of? After all, the only humans alive are his
family, and while his parents might have "wanted to kill him," they
would not literally do so. The Ramban answers that Cain was afraid of the
animals, who were so upset at Cain for having disturbed the perfect harmony
between Torah and nature. The Torah prohibits murder, and by man committing
murder he polluted the environment and thus Hashem had to place a sign on his
forehead, warning the animals not to kill Cain. Ideally, there is a perfect
balance.</p>

<P>With this background I believe we can understand and
appreciate the insight of the <i>Be'er Yosef</i> who cites the <i>Medrash</i>
(<i>Bamidbar Rabbah</i> 19:6) that Hashem revealed the reason for the enigma of
the Parah Adumah - red heifer exclusively to Moshe. The wise King Solomon said,
"I thought I could become wise, but it is beyond me" (<i>Koheles</i>
7:23.) The Medrash understands this verse as an expression of the frustration
of the wisest of all men. If, as the Medrash continues, in the future, in
Messianic times, the reason for this <i>mitzvah</i> will be public knowledge,
why did Hashem conceal its rationale from us? The above enigma, simply stated,
is that the ashes of the red heifer mixed with water are sprinkled on an
individual who is impure as a result of contact with a dead body, or under the
same roof as a deceased. The sprinkling of the ashes by a Kohen on the <i>tamei</i>
individual on the third and seventh days of his purification process was
essential in removing his <i>tum'ah</i> and his becoming <i>tahor</i>,
while the Kohen who expedited this transformation became <i>tamei</i>.</p>

<P>The <i>Be'er Yosef</i> suggests that participating and
engaging in a <i>mitzvah</i> that is beyond our comprehension but clearly
Divinely legislated can help us respond to and accept circumstances and
happenings that are equally difficult to comprehend. In <i>Parshas Ki Sisa</i>
(33:13) Moshe asked, "to see Hashem." This is understood by the
Talmud (<i>Brachos</i> 7a) that Moshe was requesting to understand Hashem,
specifically why righteous individuals suffer and not-yet good individuals
prosper? One utilized the ashes of the <i>parah</i> regularly. Every time one
went to a funeral, sat <i>shemira</i>, or participated in the <i>chevra kadisha</i>
they became <i>tameh</i> - impure. The frequent utilization of these ashes,
"helped the medicine go down." Just as one cannot understand the <i>mitzvah</i>
of the <i>parah adumah</i> so too, one often cannot understand the
circumstances and timeliness of the cause for this <i>mitzvah</i>. Just as we
accept the <i>chok</i> - statute of the <i>parah</i> knowing its Divine origin,
so too do we accept circumstances and situations knowing they too are Divinely
ordained. Thus, in the imperfect world that we now live in we need the <i>eifer
parah</i> as a kind of catharsis to aid our spiritually challenging wounds.</p>

<P>The <i>Be'er Yosef z"tl</i> continues in this vein and
discusses the two giants of their times, Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i> and Rav Akiva.
The Talmud (<i>Menachos</i> 29b) relates that when Moshe ascended <i>Har</i>
Sinai he found Hashem adorning seven letters in the Torah with crowns. When
Moshe asked why, he was told that there would be a great scholar Akiva <i>ben</i>
Yosef who would reveal multitudes of laws from these crowns. Moshe was so
intrigued that he asked to see him in action. Hashem played the projector of
the future and Moshe sat in the eighth row of Rav Akiva's shiur and was most
frustrated as he did not understand the presentation until he heard one of the
students ask for a particular source and Rav Akiva responded that it is a <i>halacha
l'Moshe miSinai</i> - a law given to Moshe without our understanding. This assuaged
Moshe's feelings. Thus, even Rav Akiva, who revealed so many secrets of
Torah, even he, needed to know that there are areas we just don't know and
can't understand.</p>

<P>The Gemara continues that Moshe asked to see what the end of
Rav Akiva's life was like, and was shown his being tortured to death, with
Shema Yisrael on his lips (<i>Berachos</i> 61b.) Moshe immediately burst forth
with "is this the reward for Torah?" Hashem responded that he be
silent this is that which emanated from His Divine thought beyond man's
comprehension. Thus, just as Rav Akiva accepted <i>halacha l'Moshe miSinai</i>,
so too, it was easier for Moshe to accept the Divine plan. Just as in the Torah
there are laws beyond our comprehension so too in the Divine governing of the
world, there are happenings we cannot fathom or comprehend.</p>

<P>What emerges ultimately from the <i>parah adumah</i> is the
bolstering of our <i>emunah</i>. While we cannot understand all, we submit to
His higher authority. This is most crucial all year long, but especially as we
approach the holiday of <i>Pesach</i>. The <i>parah adumah</i> humbles us,
which helps us put Him at the center of our universe, and not ourselves. Thus I
pray that our reading and studying of <i>Parshas Parah</i> will not only be a
fulfillment of "<i>unishalma parim sefaseinu</i> - let our lips
substitute for bulls" (Hoshea 14:3), i.e. that it be looked upon and
considered as if we actually brought the <i>parah adumah</i>, but may it
inspire us to greater <i>bitachon</i> to know that we don't know, but He does!</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: sukkos]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Why do we read Koheles on Sukkos? The Avudraham brings two
reasons in the name of the Even Harchi: 1) In Koheles (11:2) we are taught,
"Distribute portions to seven or even to eight" which Koheles <i>Raba</i>
explains in the name of R. Levi that "seven" refers to the seven
days of Sukkos and "eight" to Shimni Atzertes 2) Shlomo <i>Hamelech</i>
taught this megillah to many varied groups of pilgrims that came to spend the <i>yom
tov</i> of Sukkos in Yerushalayim, as we find in the opening verse of the <i>haftarah</i>
for the second day of Sukkos, "all the men of Israel gathered before Shlomo
<i>Hamelech</i>, in the month of the mighty ones (Tishrei), on the festival of
the seventh month" (I Kings 8:2.)</p>

<P>I'd like to share another reason based on the
teachings of Rav Pinchus Friedman <i>shlit"a</i>, the Rosh <i>Kolel</i>
of Belz. The Talmud (<i>Shabbos</i> 30b) teaches that our Ravs who canonized
the latter books of scripture sought to exclude the book of Koheles from the
canon, for they saw that its statements contradict one another. Why did they
not exclude it? Because the beginning of the book consists of words of Torah
and its end consists of words of Torah. What are examples of the statements
that contradict one another? On the one hand, "anger is better than
laughter" (7:3), but earlier, "of laughter I have said it is
praiseworthy" (2:2.) In another example of seeming contradictions, chapter
three begins with twenty-eight different times, fourteen good fourteen bad.
Also striking is the tone of frustration that is found throughout the book, such as
the opening verse of "futility of futilities or vanity of vanities, all
is futile" and "so I hated life, for I was depressed by all that
goes on under the sun" (2:17.) </p>

<P>In fact, Rav Moshe Avigdor Amiel <i>z"l </i>(former
chief Rav of Tel Aviv-Yafo and an outstanding <i>darshan</i>) in <i>Drashos
El Ami</i> II:7 asks a profound question: why was Koheles the longest of the <i>megilos</i>
with its contradictory content? Why was it not shortened by eliminating the
contradictions and keeping only the words of Torah which caused it to be
included in the canon? His answer (and that of the <i>Shvilai Pinchus</i>) is
that there is much to learn from the contradictions. In fact, Sukkos is <i>zman
simchaseinu</i> and our Ravs teach "<i>ein simcha kehatoras hasveikos</i>",
meaning there is abundant joy and contentment with the resolution of problems.
Similarly, there is much joy in learning the lessons of the seeming
contradictions.</p>

<P>A cursory view of the world often contradicts our pure
belief in Hashem and His Divine Providence. In fact, the very precise nature of
the world hides His presence. This is stated explicitly in (<i>Devarim</i>
4:19), "Lest you raise your eyes to the heaven and see the sun, moon, and
stars, the entire legion of heaven, and you be drawn astray to bow to them and
worship them." Thus, as Hashem replies to Moshe at the burning bush in
response to his question as to whom shall I say spoke to me, "the G-d of
your forefathers...this is my name forever" (<i>Shemos</i> 3:15.) The
word <i>l'olam</i> - forever is written without the <i>vav</i>, and on
the level of <i>derash</i> is interpreted to mean, <i>l'elam</i> - hidden.
Hashem is hidden in His world, and thus gives man the choice to believe or not;
if His presence would be more apparent, there'd be no room for choosing
not to believe.</p>

<P>Moreover, one of the basic beliefs of Judaism is that of <i>schar
v'onesh</i> - reward and punishment. Repeatedly in the book of <i>Devarim</i>,
and twice daily in the second paragraph of the Shema, we are assured of the reward
for observance of <i>mitzvos</i> and punishment for their neglect. And yet too
often apparent tragedies lead one to question this reality. Indeed Moshe, the
greatest prophet, asks Hashem, "show me your glory" (<i>Shemos</i>
33:13) which is understood by the Talmud (<i>Berachos</i> 7a) to mean, "let
me understand you! Why is it that some righteous suffer and the evil prosper?"
So too, Yirmiyahu asks, "why does the way of the wicked prosper?" (12:1.)
How are we to explain the apparent contradiction between <i>schar v'onesh</i>
and events that seems to indicate a lack thereof?</p>

<P>I'd like to share two approaches to dealing with this
issue. Firstly, the sukkah is called <i>tzila d'mehemnusa</i> - sitting
in the shade of faith. Just as the <i>matzah</i> is called <i>ma'achl d'mehemnusa</i>
- bread of faith, and through its consumption one imbibes faith, similarly
sitting in the <i>sukkah</i> enables an individual to connect with Hashem and with
the belief that all that He does is for the best (<i>Berachos</i> 61b). The
greater one's belief, the less contradiction and challenges one will
perceive from without. The Vilna Gaon (whose <i>yahrzeit</i> is <i>Chol HaMoed</i>
Sukkos) was asked: how do you know that Avraham observed the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>sukkah</i>?
The Gaon answered that the Torah's statement that Hashem blessed Avraham "<i>ba'kol</i>
- with everything" (<i>Bereishis</i> 24:1) contains references to three <i>pesukim</i>
about Sukkos; the <i>beis</i> in <i>ba'kol</i> refers to (<i>Vayikra</i>
23:42) "<i>basukkos teishvu shiv'as yamim</i> - in sukkos you shall
reside for seven days", the <i>chaf</i> refers to the next verse, "<i>kol
ezrach</i>", and the <i>lamed</i> refers to the verse after that, "<i>lema'an
yeidu</i>." Why should <i>ba'kol - </i>with<i> <u>everything</u></i>
- be understood narrowly as referring to Sukkos? Rav Yeruchum Olshon <i>shlit"a</i>
explains (in <i>Yerach L'moadim</i>) that <i>emunah</i> is a <i>middah koleles</i>
- it includes all other positive traits, as it is the basic foundation of our
faith. As such, the reference to <i>Sukkos</i> which is called <i>tzila
d'mehemnusa</i>, is in fact a reference to everything we believe in.</p>

<P>Secondly, all the questions and perceived contradictions of
life emerge from our attributing too much primary significance to this world.
Yonah is asked by the captain of the ship, "who are you?" and he
answers, "I am an <i>Ivri</i> - a Hebrew." Too many of us would first
answer, "I'm a lawyer", "I'm a doctor", "I'm
a computer programmer", etc., and perhaps only secondarily mention that
we are Jews. What is primary in our lives and what is secondary? When one
experiences setbacks whose repercussions are exclusively this-worldly, e.g. in
business, is that justification to question Hashem and relax one's eternally
meaningful and valuable religious observance? If the teaching of Rav Yaakov (Avos
4:21), that this world is a lobby to the next world which is the ultimate
Dining Hall, is understood and internalized, then the <i>ohel arei</i> (temporary
structure) of the <i>sukkah</i> presents a mindset that enables us to live with
the apparent <i>sfeikos</i>-contradictions of life. The Rambam (end of <i>Hilchos
Deios</i>) explains that one should not bear a grudge or harbor resentment to
one who wronged him since after all is said and done, how important is it? Is
it worth getting upset about? In the bigger picture it is all <i>arei</i> -
temporary. <i>Rabbeinu</i> Bachya teaches that the sukkah represents <i>olam ha'ba</i>.</p>

<P>The Alshich teaches that "in <i>sukkos</i> you shall
reside for seven days" (Vayikra 23:42) represents the seventy years of
one's life, as it's all only <i>arei</i>-transient. In addition,
commenting on, "These are the products of the heaven and earth when they
were created <i>behibarum</i>" (<i>Bereishis</i> 2:4) Rashi teaches that
this world was created with the letter <i>hey</i>. Among the many
interpretations of this idea, the Alshich suggests that the way the world is
like the letter <i>hey</i> is found in the minimum acceptable configuration of
the <i>sukkah</i>'s walls, "<i>shtayim k'hilchoso u'shlishis afilu tefach</i>-two
complete walls and the third even a handbreadth", which can also describe
the shape of the letter <i>hey</i>. This world is like a <i>sukkah</i>, as we
have elaborated above.</p>

<P>The Jewish world was shaken and shocked by the killing of
Ari Fuld, <i>hashem Yikom Damo</i>. I was privileged to know him from birth. He
lived in accordance with the teachings of the Ramban on the opening verse of
Koheles. The Ramban there explains the words, "<i>haveil haveilim</i>"
not as a noun - vanity of vanities - but rather as an imperative: <i>haveil haveilim</i>
- make temporary those things that should be temporary. His bullet proof vest,
worn as part of his gear in the Lebanese War, essentially saved his life from shrapnel
that hit him in that war. He permanently displayed the shrapnel alongside his <i>kiddush</i>
cup and <i>menorah</i> in his modest break front. From that wartime moment on
he lived <i>haveil haveilim</i>; he felt that Hashem saved his life to
demonstrate what is important and what is not. His public debates with those
whose ideology was contrary to his love of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, <i>Toras Yisrael</i>,
and <i>Am Yisrael</i> and his sincerity in caring for so many that crossed his
path were tremendous inspirations to so many. To his parents we say <i>ashrei yoladito</i>,
and for his wife, children and his entire family, we pray that the legacy of
his living a <i>sukkah</i> life with no questions and contradictions may be a
constant <i>nechama</i> to you. The extraordinary courage and resiliency that his
entire family has displayed has further uplifted <i>Klal Yisroel</i>'s <i>emunah</i>
and <i>bitachon</i>. Ari inspired in his life and is doing so in his passing as
well. <i>Yehi Zichro Baruch</i>.</p>

<P>The Torah declares twice with regards to the development of
Moshe that he grew up and became a <i>gadol</i>. The <i>pasuk</i> initially
states, "The child <u>grew up</u>, and she brought him to Pharaoh's
daughter and he became like her son" (<i>Shemos</i> 2:10), and then
again, "Now it came to pass in those days that Moshe <u>grew up</u> and
went out to his brothers and looked at their burdens" (<i>Shemos</i> 2:11).
The Ramban explains that this description is repeated in order to indicate that
Moshe achieved not only physical maturity, but spiritual maturity as well. It
would seem that the definition of spiritual maturity is when one is able to see
the burdens of others and identify with their pain. However, the <i>pasuk</i>
continues, "he saw an Egyptian man striking a Jewish man of his brothers.
He turned this way and that way, and he saw that there was no man, so he struck
the Egyptian and hid him in the sand" (<i>Shemos</i> 2:11-12). Moshe not
only empathized with others, he also jeopardized his own anonymity and security
in order to save the life of someone else. This implies that the height of
spiritual <i>gadlus</i> and maturity is when one is willing to sacrifice from themselves
for others. In fact, Rashi (<i>Avos</i> 5:21) claims that the age of spiritual
maturity for boys, <i>bar</i> <i>mitzvah</i>, is derived from Levi, who at the
age of thirteen was considered a "man" (<i>Breishis</i> 34:25),
because he was ready to pick up a sword and endanger his own safety in order to
defend his sister Dinah.</p>

<P>As a result of their willingness to sacrifice for others,
Levi, and specifically Moshe, were worthy of becoming the future teachers and
leaders of the Jewish people. In <i>Parshas Vayechi</i>, Yaakov blessed Levi,
"I will separate them throughout Yaakov, and I will scatter them
throughout Yisrael" (<i>Breishis</i> 49:7). <i>Rashi</i> explains that
the tribe of Levi had to be spread and sent throughout all of Eretz Yisrael
because their primary duty would be to teach Torah to the entirety of the
Jewish people. Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky (<i>Emes L'Yaakov</i>) adds that it
was specifically Levi who was chosen for this mission, because every <i>rebbi</i>
and teacher of Torah, must be able to sacrifice from themselves for their
students and the community. When Levi took up arms to defend Dinah, he
demonstrated the capacity to sacrifice for others, making his descendants
uniquely suitable for the role of teachers and leaders within the community.
Similarly, in <i>Parshas</i> <i>Vayigash </i>(<i>Brieshis</i> 46:28), Yaakov
sent Yehudah ahead of the rest of the caRavan to establish a <i>beis medrash</i>,
a house of Torah study in Goshen. Rav Alexander Zusia Friedman (<i>Avnei Azel</i>)
claims that Yehudah was singled out for this task because he pledged to
preserve the welfare of Binyamin at great personal expense and peril. Yehudah's
mindset of self-sacrifice and mutual responsibility is necessary when
inaugurating a school of Torah study.</p>

<P>It is for this reason that Yocheved and Miriam who
endangered their own well-being in order to save the lives of Jewish babies
were rewarded by Hashem with "houses", as the <i>pasuk</i> states "He
made houses for them" (<i>Shemos</i> 1:21). The Gemara (<i>Sotah</i> 11b)
clarifies that the founders of the "houses" of religious leadership
and royalty, <i>Kehunah</i>, <i>Leviah</i>, and <i>Malchus</i>, would be
descendants of Yocheved and Miriam. Interestingly, it was Bilaam who advised
Pharaoh to drown the Jewish babies (<i>Sotah</i> 11a and <i>Shemos Rabbah</i>
1:9), and according to Tosfos (<i>Brochos</i> 7a) Bilaam was accustomed to cursing
the Jewish people daily by uttering the word "<i>kalem</i>",
"annihilate them." Therefore, it is not surprising that Yocheved
and Miriam, who thwarted the despicable plan of Bilaam, which was presumably
triggered by the familiar formula of "<i>kalem</i>," should be
rewarded with the houses of <i>Kehunah</i>, <i>Leviah</i>, and <i>Malchus</i>
whose acronym is also "<i>KaLeM</i>." However, on a conceptual
level as well, this was an appropriate reward for Yocheved and Miriam, and
commensurate with their contribution. Religious leadership and royalty demand
that one be prepared to sacrifice from themselves for others. Therefore, in
recognition of their act of selflessness on behalf of the Jewish people, they
rightfully deserved to be the matriarchs and paradigm for all future Jewish
leaders.</p>

<P>In addition, even one act of self-sacrifice on behalf of
others, can often outweigh and eclipse a host of other faults and
transgressions. According to many <i>meforshim</i>, Dasan and Aviram from the
tribe of Reuven were a pair of devious instigators. From their time together in
Mitzrayim, throughout their tRavels in the desert, they consistently plotted
against Moshe. Rashi (<i>Shemos</i> 2:15) writes that it was Dasan and Aviram who
informed on Moshe to the authorities, requiring him to flee to Midian. Later,
Rashi (<i>Shemos</i> 16:20) identifies the two individuals who defied the
instructions of Moshe and left the <i>manna</i> over until the morning as Dasan
and Aviram. Rabbeinu Bachya claims that it was Dasan and Aviram who proclaimed,
"Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 14:4).
The Torah (<i>Bamidbar</i> 16:1) includes Dasan and Aviram as central figures
in the attempted coup and rebellion of Korach. Finally, in <i>Parshas Beshalach</i>,
the <i>pasuk</i> (<i>Shemos</i> 14:3) implies that there were two Jews who did
not escape with Bnei Yisrael but elected to stay behind with Pharoah, and the <i>Targum
Yonasan</i> identifies these two individuals as Dasan and Aviram.</p>

<P>If Dasan and Aviram were such detestable people who elected
to stay behind in Mitzrayim, how did they survive the plague of darkness? Rashi
(<i>Shemos</i> 10:22) claims that Hashem punished the Egyptians with darkness
in order to conceal the demise of many Jews who were either not worthy of being
redeemed or did not want to leave. If Dasan and Aviram were wicked and
preferred to stay behind in Mitzrayim why were they not killed during the plague
of darkness as well? Moreover, if they chose to stay behind how could they be present
throughout <i>Bnei Yisrael</i>'s tRavels in the desert? Rav Yehoshua
Leib Diskin (<i>Maharil Diskin)</i> explains, that despite all of their sins
and transgressions, Dasan and Aviram were spared during the plague of darkness because
they sacrificed on behalf of the Jewish people. In <i>Parshas Shemos</i> (5:14)
the Torah tells of Jewish overseers who were beaten for not coercing the Jewish
slaves to meet the stipulated quota of bricks. According to the <i>Medrash</i> (<i>Shemos
Rabbah</i> 5:20), these Jewish overseers were none other than Dasan and Aviram.
The beatings they endured in order to protect their fellow Jews from cruel and
sadistic quotas, overshadowed all of their other offenses and indescretions and
shielded them during the plague of darkness.</p>

<p>Similarly, Rav Chaim of Chernowitz (<i>Be'er Mayim Chaim</i>)
suggests that Dasan and Aviram were reunited with the rest of <i>Bnei Yisrael</i>
in the desert, even though they initially chose to remain behind in Mitzrayim,
because Hashem split the <i>Yam Suf</i> a second time, just for them! The Torah
states "Then the children of Yisrael came into the midst of the sea on
dry land, and the waters were to them as a wall from their right and from their
left" (<i>Shemos</i> 14:22). After the Egyptians pursued <i>Bnei Yisrael</i>
into the sea and the waters came crashing down upon them, the Torah states
again, "the children of Yisrael went on dry land in the midst of the sea,
and the water was to them like a wall from their right and from their left"
(<i>Shemos</i> 14:29). The <i>Be'er Mayim Chaim</i> explains that Hashem
split the waters of the <i>Yam</i> <i>Suf</i> twice; the first time on behalf
of the majority of <i>Bnei Yisrael </i>who initially chose to leave, and the
second time for the sole benefit of Dasan and Aviram. Despite all of the damage
caused by Dasan and Aviram, Hashem rescued them in dramatic fashion only
because they had withstood suffering on behalf of others. In the merit of a
renewed sense of obligation to the community, and a profound sense of appreciation
to those who have sacrificed on our behalf and on behalf of others, may we all
be blessed with permanent "houses" of Torah scholarship and leadership,
and may Hashem redeem us once again with the coming of the <i>Moshiach</i>
speedily in our days!</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: breishis]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>
"And Adam gave names to all of the
animals and the birds of the sky and to all of the wild beasts, but for Adam no
fitting helper was found. So, Hashem cast a deep sleep upon Adam, and while he
slept, He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that spot. And Hashem
fashioned the rib that He had taken from Adam into a woman, and he brought her
to Adam" (<i>Breishis</i> 2:20-22). As opposed to all of the animals of
the world where the males and females were created both simultaneously and
independently, Chava was only formed subsequently and from the rib of Adam. Why
wasn't Chava fashioned individually like all of the other females in
creation? Moreover, why was it specifically necessary to remove one of the ribs
of Adam in order to create Chava?</p>

<P>
The Torah itself continues and explains,
"Therefore a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife so
that they become one flesh" (<i>Breishis</i> 2:24). If Adam and Chava had
been created independently it would have been impossible for them to later merge
together and function as one flesh in marriage, because the body naturally
rejects foreign entities and antigens. Only because Chava was included in the
original inception of Adam, were they able to be safely reunited once again through
marriage. This is reflected by the Gemara (<i>Kiddushin</i> 2b) which compares
man's search for a spouse to a person who is seeking to become reunited
with a lost item, for as long as a man is not married he is indeed missing a lost
part of himself.</p>

<P>
It is for this reason that that the Gemara (<i>Kiddushin</i>
29b) states, "until the age of twenty, Hashem sits and waits, when will
he take a wife? As soon as one reaches twenty and has not married, He exclaims,
'Blasted be his bones!'" Why is the punishment for a man who
excessively postpones marriage directed specifically towards his bones? The
Arizal explains that after the creation of Adam, every man is born with a missing
bone that can only be retrieved through marriage. The body can function for a short
while without that missing bone, but when marriage is pushed off for a
prolonged period of time, the integrity of the rest of the skeleton begins to
gradually deteriorate due to the structural stress created by the missing bone.</p>

<P>
However, perhaps Chava was taken deliberately
from the rib of Adam not only in order to set the stage for the future, but
also in order to instruct us that the only way to build a successful marriage
is when each person is willing to sacrifice on behalf of their spouse and
forfeit part of themselves for their partner. The Vilna Gaon in his commentary
to the Sefer Yetzirah, writes that the forging of deep relationships and
personal bonds are referred to by the Torah and Chazal in numerous places as a
"<i>kerisas</i> <i>bris</i>" - which literally means "cutting
off a covenant." The Vilna Gaon explains that this language is used
because real and lasting relationships can only exist when two parties are
willing to cut off part of their own agenda and give part of themselves to
someone else, just like Adam who donated part of himself to the creation of
Chava.</p>

<P>
Therefore, in order to create a healthy marriage,
it is critical that we cultivate a culture of giving and mutual sacrifice, because
only in that fashion can we create meaningful relationships and enable the <i>shechinah</i>
to truly dwell within our homes. The Torah (<i>Breishis</i> 2:23) describes
Adam as an "<i>ish</i>" - spelled <i>aleph</i>, <i>yud</i>, <i>shin</i>,
and Chava as an "<i>isha</i>" - spelled <i>aleph</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>heh</i>.
The two words, <i>ish</i> and <i>isha</i>, are almost identical. The sole difference
between them is the letter <i>yud</i> in <i>ish</i>, and the letter <i>heh</i>
in <i>isha</i>. The letters <i>yud</i> and <i>heh</i> are the first two letters
in the most commonly found name of Hashem which is spelled, <i>yud</i>, <i>heh</i>,
<i>vav</i>, and <i>heh</i>. This leads the Gemara (<i>Sotah</i> 17a) to
comment, that if an <i>ish</i> and an <i>isha</i> are meritorious and create a harmonious
marriage then the <i>shechinah</i> will reside in their midst.</p>

<P>
The Vilna Gaon adds that in order to complete
the name of Hashem there must also be a <i>kesubah</i> - spelled <i>chaf</i>, <i>tof</i>,
<i>vav</i>, <i>veis</i>, and <i>heh</i>, which is a document that outlines and
formalizes a husband's obligations towards his wife. The Vilna Gaon
submits that the word <i>kesubah</i> should be deconstructed to form the words
"<i>ksav</i> <i>vav</i> <i>heh</i>" - "a written <i>vav</i>
and a <i>heh</i>," because it is only through the commitments and
responsibilities of marriage, of giving towards one another, that the name of
Hashem, <i>yud</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>vuv</i>, and <i>heh</i> can be completed. A
relationship with a woman which is devoid of obligations is referred to by the
Torah in the plural as "<i>pilagshim</i>" (<i>Breishis</i> 25:6) or
"concubines". The Vilna Gaon claims "<i>pilagshim</i>"
is also the combination of two words "<i>paleg shem</i>" -
"splitting the name," because even a loving and peaceful marriage
that is lacking sacrifice and commitment, can only create an abbreviated and
truncated <i>hashraas</i> <i>hashechinah</i>.</p>

<P>The Gemara (<i>Gittin</i>
90b) states that a divorce is so painful that even the <i>mizbeach</i>, the
alter in the <i>Beis</i> <i>Hamikdash</i>, sheds tears. The <i>meforshim</i>
ask, why is the <i>mizbeach</i> the only utensil that cries? Why not the <i>aron</i>
or the <i>menorah</i>? A number of commentators explain, that it is because the
<i>mizbeach</i> symbolizes giving to others and self-sacrifice. Unfortunately,
divorces can occur when one party places their own needs and priorities ahead
of their spouse. When each person is relentlessly and uncompromisingly pursuing
their own individual agenda, it is impossible for a marriage to operate. Only when
each person, places their partner's needs above their own, and is willing
to sacrifice and give of themselves to their spouse can a marriage function
properly.</p>

<P>
Our relationship with Hashem and the Torah is
also frequently compared to a marriage. The <i>pasuk</i> states "Moshe
commanded us in the Torah an inheritance (<i>morashah</i>) of the congregation
of Yaakov" (<i>Devarim</i> 33:4), and the Gemara (<i>Pesachim</i> 49b)
adds, do not read the word as "<i>morashah</i>" - "an
inheritance" but rather as "<i>me'orasah</i>" - "a
betrothal." This is because our relationship with Hashem is also rooted
in the notion of giving and self-sacrifice.</p>

<P>
The Gemara (<i>Gittin</i> 60b) states that Hashem
made a covenant, He was <i>kores</i> <i>bris</i> with <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> only
for the sake of the Oral Torah, as it says, "for by the mouth of these
words I have made a covenant (<i>karati itcha bris</i>) with you and with Yisrael"
(<i>Shemos</i> 32:27). The Vilna Gaon explains that <i>Bnei</i> <i>Yisrael's</i>
unique relationship with Hashem is predicated upon the Oral Torah and not the
Written Torah, because it was specifically the Oral Torah that Hashem gave over
to <i>Bnei</i> <i>Yisrael</i> to develop and expand. Our relationship with
Hashem was cemented through the generosity and 'sacrifice' of
Hashem in relinquishing, to a certain degree, the stewardship of the Oral Torah
to the Jewish people.</p>

<P>
Similarly, Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Iggros
Moshe</i>) writes that the unique holiness of the Jewish people, is not defined
and generated by our obligation to perform the positive commandments, but
rather by our observance of the negative commandments and the prohibitions and
restrictions of the Torah. It is only through forfeiting certain physical experiences
and sacrificing part of our own agenda for Hashem that we are able to be <i>koreis</i>
<i>bris</i> and establish a permanent and profound relationship with Hashem.</p>

<p>The Written Torah begins with the letter <i>beis</i>,
from the word "<i>breishis</i>," and the Oral Torah concludes with
the letter <i>mem</i>, from the word "<i>shalom</i>." The letters
that precede these two letters in the alphabet are <i>lamed</i> and <i>aleph</i>
which spells "<i>lo</i>" - or "no." Perhaps this in
order to teach us, that we can only enter into the world of Torah and begin to form
a relationship with Hashem, after we have already acquired the ability to say
"no" and embrace the self-sacrifice which is demanded by the restrictions
and prohibitions of the Torah. May we all cultivate the capacity to give and
sacrifice parts of ourselves for our spouse and for the Torah, and in that <i>zechus</i>
may we all be blessed with a full measure of <i>hashraas</i> <i>hashechinah</i>
in our homes and all aspects of our lives.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The ritual impurity of a corpse is introduced with the words, "This is the Torah: when a
man dies in a tent, anyone entering the tent and anything in the tent shall be
unclean for seven days" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 19:14). The Gemara (<i>Berachos</i>
63b) infers from the unnecessary use of the word "Torah" in this
context that matters of Torah can only be retained by a person who is willing
to figuratively "kill" themselves in order to acquire it. The
Chafetz Chaim suggests that a person has to metaphorically "kill"
themselves in the sense that all extraneous disturbances and interruptions must
be tuned out while learning Torah. In a similar manner in which the deceased
are unable to participate in everyday activities, we must carve out times in our
schedules which are free from avoidable disruptions. This is critical because
generally the <i>mitzvah</i> to learn Torah is circumscribed to the hours of
the day which are otherwise unoccupied by our daily responsibilities (see <i>Kovetz</i>
<i>Shiurim</i> vol. 2 section 19 and <i>Birkas</i> <i>Shmuel</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i>,
section 27 part 4.) Therefore, part of the obligation to learn Torah inevitably
requires us to do our best to restrict our daily activities to specific parts
of the day and cordon off other times to be dedicated solely to Torah study.</p>

<P>The reference to <i>talmud</i>
<i>Torah</i> in this context also indicates that in order to learn Torah
successfully we must be consumed with the learning of Torah even to the point
of utter exhaustion. The Gemara (<i>Shabbos</i> 83b) derives from the word
"Torah" in this <i>pasuk</i>, "One should never prevent
himself from attending the <i>beis</i> <i>medrash</i> or from engaging in
matters of Torah, even at the moment of death." How is it possible to
learn Torah even at the moment of death? (Rav Moshe Shmuel Shapiro actually sees
this as the source for the custom to recite <i>shema</i> prior to passing.) Rav
Moshe Wolfson (<i>Emunas</i> <i>Itecha</i>) explains that the Gemara is
instructing us to learn Torah even during those times in our life when we feel
emotionally spent and physically drained, when we are empty of energy and void
of desire. In fact, it is the learning that we do when we are fatigued that is arguably
the most transformative. The <i>pasuk</i> states "In addition my wisdom
remained with me" (<i>Koheles</i> 2:9.) The Hebrew word used here for "in
addition" - "<i>af</i>" - also means "anger." This
leads the <i>Yalkut</i> <i>Shimoni</i> (section 968) to conclude that it is
specifically the Torah which is studied during times of "anger" or
duress, when life is most challenging, that will leave an indelible impression
upon us.</p>

<P>However, when we are tired
and worn out our ability to retain information is usually dramatically impaired.
How can we be productive when we are exhausted? Moreover, why should the Torah
that we learn when we are depleted and depressed be the most formidable and
memorable? Rav Shach (<i>Avi Ezri</i> on <i>Nashim</i>) answers that Torah is a
supernatural discipline, an interaction with the Divine, which functions in its
own dimension and by its own set of rules. When enormous effort is exhibited in
an attempt to acquire Torah knowledge, Hashem gifts wisdom to the recipient
even in a fashion that exceedes our normal human limitations. The Gemara (<i>Megillah</i>
6b) states, "If a person says to you: I have labored and I have found
success, believe him." If a person has labored sufficiently then he has
triumphed all on his own. Why does the Gemara insist on describing his accomplishment
as something which is "found" or stumbled upon? The Chiddushei
Harim explains that Torah knowledge is never attained naturally and independently
but only through Divine benevolence triggered by a sincere and sustained
effort.</p>

<P>It is for this reason
that toiling in Torah is described as an inexplicable "statute", or
"<i>chok</i>." The word "Torah" also appears in <i>Parshas</i>
<i>Chukas</i> in connection with the purification process of the red heifer,
the <i>parah adumah</i>, as the <i>pasuk</i> states, "This is the statute
of the Torah which Hashem commanded" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 19:2.) <i>Parah
adumah</i> is the classical enigmatic <i>chok</i>, for the very same ashes that
purify the defiled also defile the pure. Learning Torah is mentioned in
connection with the <i>chok</i> of <i>parah</i> <i>adumah</i>, because the act
of learning Torah is itself a <i>chok</i> as well. <i>Parshas</i> <i>Bechukosai</i>
begins, "You should follow My statutes" (<i>Vayikra</i> 26:3), which
<i>Rashi</i> interprets as "you should study the Torah laboriously." What
is so perplexing about the activity of learning Torah that it deserves to be
labeled as a <i>chok</i>? The Chasam Sofer explains that laboring in Torah is classified
as a <i>chok</i> because while there are exceptionally intellegent individuals
who can master the natural disciplines quickly and with ease, it is absolutely
axiomatic that Torah knowledge can only be attained through a demonstration of great
determination and excessive toil, which then prompts a measure of Divine
intervention.</p>

<p>In fact, all of the
letters of the <i>aleph beis</i> are found in the blessings of <i>Parshas</i> <i>Bechukosai</i>
with the exception of the letter <i>samech</i>, which has the numerical value
of sixty. The Rokeach claims that this is an allusion to the sixty<i> masechtos</i>
of <i>shas</i>, because as opposed to earthly pursuits and prosperity, Torah
knowledge can only be attained through personal effort and exertion, and not by
means of a great intellect, godsend, or benediction alone. The Steipler Gaon once
responded to a student, "you must know that becoming great in Torah does
not come from blessings. There is only one way to accomplish success in
learning, and that is to distance yourself from wasting time and to dedicate every
moment to Torah learning." While we should pray for assistance in
retaining Torah knowledge, there is no substitute or shortcut for the hard work
that is required. If we exert ourselves fully and allocate time for learning
Torah properly, may Hashem bestow upon us a deep understanding of Torah, and
may we enjoy the full spectrum of the blessings the Torah has to offer.</p>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Daniel Stein]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2018]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: reeh]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The opening <i>pasuk</i> in <i>Parshas Re'eh</i>
states, "<i>Re'eh anochi nosein lifneichem hayom berachah
u'klalah</i> - See that I have placed before you today a
blessing and a curse" (<i>Devarim</i> 11:26). This <i>passuk</i> hints to
a number of choices that are presented to us, not only regarding the <i>mitzvos</i>
and their performance, but also concerning our ego, our time, and the new year,
which all share a common scheme.</p>

<P>The <i>meforshim</i> wonder why the Torah uses the
word "<i>anochi</i> - I" as opposed to the more familiar "<i>ani</i>."
The <i>Maor Vashemesh</i> explains in the name of the Maggid of Zlotchov that
the word "<i>anochi</i>" represents not only the word
"I" but more precisely our "<i>anochiyus,</i>" our ego.
Similarly, in <i>Parshas</i> <i>Vaeschanan</i> when Moshe informs <i>Bnei</i> <i>Yisrael</i>,
"<i>anochi omeid bein Hashem uveineichem</i> - I will stand between you
and Hashem" (<i>Devarim</i> 5:5), he was not only referring to the fact
the he would literally serve as the liaison between Hashem and the Jewish people,
but also to the notion that often the primary obstacle standing in between
ourselves and Hashem, impeding our ability to connect with Hashem, is our
"<i>anochi</i>" our ego. The further we tread into the abyss of
self-congratulation the more difficult it can be to identify potential areas
for personal and religious growth.</p>

<P>Even though an inflated ego can hinder our ability to
serve Hashem properly, self-awareness and self-confidence are necessary to
achieve any measure of spiritual success. Rav Tzadok Hakohen (<i>Tzidkas</i> <i>Hatzadik</i>)
writes that "just as a person must have <i>emunah</i> - belief in Hashem,
a person ought to have <i>emunah</i> - belief in himself." In order to
lead a life dedicated to Torah and <i>mitzvos</i>, a person must know that his
life is meaningful and consequential and that his existence and accomplishments
have an infinite value to Hashem and to himself. Indeed, Rav Aharon Kotler (<i>Mishnas
Rebbi Aharon</i>) claims that the prohibition against mutilating and defacing
our bodies even while mourning (<i>Devarim</i> 14:1) is a reminder and
reflection of our inherent and limitless self-worth. Without this awareness it
is impossible to execute the <i>mitzvos</i> of the Torah. For this reason, those
who publicly behave in a demeaning and degrading fashion are disqualified from
testifying in <i>beis</i> <i>din</i> (see <i>Kiddushin</i> 40b and Rambam <i>Hil.
Eidus</i> 11:5). Rav Aharon explains that this is because someone who lacks personal
dignity will presumably be capable of compromising their integrity as well.</p>

<P>The <i>Maor</i> <i>Vashemesh</i> submits that the <i>pasuk</i>
"<i>Re'eh anochi nosein lifneicheim hayom berachah u'klalah</i>,"
places before us a dilemma concerning our "<i><u>anochi</u></i>,"
our ego. If we utilize our "<i>anochi</i>" to give us the confidence
to vigorously and relentlessly pursue an ambitious religious agenda, then it can
certainly be a source of blessing. However, if our "<i>anochi</i>" lulls
us into a bloated sense of entitlement and satisfaction, content with reveling
in the achievements of the past, then it can be a horrible curse. How we use
our "<i>anochi</i>" is entirely up to us.</p>

<P>Similarly, Rav Avraham Brum (<i>Likuttei Eish</i>) cites
the Alexander Rebbe who interprets the word "<i><u>hayom</u></i>" -
"today" in this <i>pasuk</i>, as a reference to our time in general.
For some, time is an invaluable blessing and for others it is an agonizing curse.
For the righteous, who are methodically mastering the library of Torah, and
continuously climbing the mountain of Hashem, time is the greatest of all assets
and resources. As the Chafetz Chaim once said, "time is not money money is
time." Additionally, Rav Moshe Shmuel Shapiro (<i>Zehav Mi'sheba</i>)
maintains that the overall relative financial prosperity of American Jewry can
be attributed to their benevolence and generosity, as well as their unforgiving
and industrious work ethic. However, for those lacking direction and
determination, who seek to drift through their existence in this world, time can
be the greatest enemy. It is often viewed as a lurking beast which needs to be
slain and "killed", or as an obstruction which needs to be
"passed" and whittled away. How will we view our time in this world,
as a boundless blessing or as an interminable life-sentence? Once again, the
decision is all ours.</p>

<P>Finally, the Vizhnitzer <i>Rebbe</i> (<i>Imrei Chaim</i>)
suggests that the word "<i><u>re'eh</u></i>", spelled "<i>reish</i>,
<i>aleph,</i> <i>heh</i>", is an acronym for Elul and Rosh Hashanah,
which begin with the letters <i>aleph</i>, <i>reish</i>, and <i>heh</i>. This
contention is supported by the Zohar which states that the word "<i>hayom</i>"
- "today," refers to "The Day" of Rosh Hashanah, the annual
Day of Judgment. The month of Elul and Rosh Hashanah are alluded to in this <i>pasuk</i>
because they too can either be exploited as a precious opportunity for
reflection and spiritual growth, giving way to a year of blessing and
prosperity, or alternatively, they can be viewed as a burdensome inconvenience
which simply needs to be tolerated and endured, contributing to and validating
an unwanted decree for the coming year, <i>chas ve'shalom</i>. How will
we approach Elul and Rosh Hashanah? It is up to us to decide.</p>

<p>This year, <i>Parshas Re'eh</i> introduces the
month of Elul and confronts us with many difficult choices and possibilities.
How to manage our ego? How to maximize our time? How to formulate a strategy
for the <i>Yomim</i> <i>Noraim</i> and the coming year? However, the <i>pasuk</i>,
"<i><u>re'eh</u> <u>anochi</u> nosein lifneichem <u>hayom</u> berachah
u'klalah</i>" alerts us to the realization that all of these issues
are up to us, they are all in our own hands, and we are advised and encouraged
to "choose life" - "<i>u'vacharta ba'chaim</i>"
(<i>Devarim</i> 30:19). May we have the strength to choose wisely and may Hashem
grant us many years of continuous and limitless <i>berachah</i> and <i>hatzlacha</i>!
A <i>gut gebentched yor</i> and <i>a kesivah ve'chasima tovah</i>!</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: tazria]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P><i>Tzaraas</i> can manifest itself either on the body, on the clothing, or on the walls of the
home. The <i>Medrash</i>, cited by the <i>Daas Zekeinem M'Baalei Tosfos</i>
as well as the <i>Rambam</i> (<i>Hil</i>chos <i>Tumaas</i> <i>Tzaraas</i>), explains
that these three possible kinds of <i>tzaraas</i> are interrelated. They
represent a progression of severity that correspond to three different points
on the timeline of spiritual decay. At first, Hashem inflicts our homes with <i>tzaraas</i>,
in order to encourage us to improve. However, that is just a cautionary shot
across the bow. If we heed Hashem's message and see the error of our
ways, the <i>tzaraas</i> on the walls of our home will dissipate and not spread
any further. However, if we continue down the same sinful trajectory then Hashem
will send <i>tzaraas</i> again, this time not to our home but to our clothing,
which is more direct and difficult to ignore. If we somehow manage to overlook
this warning as well, then the <i>tzaraas</i> will appear on our skin itself, presenting
an unmistakable and immediate calamity that demands our undivided attention.</p>

<P>The <i>Kli
Yakar</i> observes that the three areas wherein <i>tzaraas</i> can materialize
are all coverings. Our skin covers our bodies which is in turn covered by our clothing
all of which are housed inside of our home. The <i>Megaleh Amukos</i> claims
that the <i>tzaraas</i> found on these three coverings corresponds to the
corruption of the three <i>mitzvos</i> which we use to cover ourselves on a daily
basis. The Gemara (<i>Menachos</i> 43b) states that Hashem surrounded us with <i>mitzvos</i>
in order to deter us from sinning. The <i>tefillin</i> which covers our heads
and arms, the <i>tzitzis</i> which adorn our garments, and the <i>mezuzah</i> which
is placed on the outside of our home, are all meant to serve as a protective
covering and barrier to sin. The <i>tefilin</i> protect our bodies, the <i>tzitzis</i>
cover our clothing, and the <i>mezuzah</i> secures our home. Therefore, when
one develops <i>tzaraas</i> as a result of habitual sinning, it is appropriate
and instructive that the <i>tzaraas</i> manifest itself specifically on one of
these three coverings, each of which is safeguarded by a different <i>mitzvah</i>,
which was willfully disregarded somewhere along the way. </p>

<P>In
addition, the Gemara (<i>Arachin</i> 15b) states that one of the specific sins
that most often precipitates an episode of <i>tzaraas</i> is <i>lashon</i> <i>hara</i>,
evil and harmful speech. The Gemara continues and explains that in order to
protect us from speaking <i>lashon</i> <i>hara</i>, <i>Hashem</i> surrounded our
tongue with three covering or obstacles to sin. The tongue is positioned
horizontally in a resting position, as opposed to the other limbs of the body
which are vertical and poised to act. In addition, the tongue is further
shielded by a wall of teeth, which is then enclosed within our lips that can be
completely sealed. Therefore, it should not be surprising that there are also three
possible forms of <i>tzaraas</i> that can contaminate the individual who
presumably spoke <i>lashon</i> <i>hara</i> by breaching the three defensive
measures protecting the tongue, and that part of his rehabilitation should
include being exiled from all of the three encampments and settlements which encircle
and protect the <i>Mishkan</i> (see <i>Vayikra</i> 13, 46). </p>

<p>The
fact that our tongue and mouth are so heavily fortified emphasizes the
importance of our speech and indicates the potential our mouths have to be a
vehicle for <i>kedushah</i> and holiness. In a certain sense, our tongue, which
is thrice secured, is comparable only to the holy Ark which was also blanketed
beneath three protective layers while tRaveling, consisting of the <i>paroches</i>,
the skin of a <i>tachash</i>, and a cloth dyed with <i>techeiles</i> (see <i>Bamidbar</i>
4, 5-6). Rav Yisrael Salanter explains that <i>Parshas Shemini</i>, which
speaks about forbidden foods, is followed by <i>Parshas</i> <i>Tazria</i> and <i>Metzorah</i>
which deals with the consequences of speaking <i>lashon</i> <i>hara</i>, in
order to teach us that we must be just as careful about what goes in our mouth
as what comes out of our mouth. Unfortunately, often, even those people who
would never dream of eating something which is prohibited have no qualms about
speaking <i>lashon</i> <i>hara</i>. Perhaps for this reason, while often a
double seal is sufficient to ensure that food is kosher, our tongue and our
speech require a triple covering.</p>

<P>
In order to evade the persistent overtures of the wife
of Potiphar, Yosef ran and escaped from the house, as the <i>pasuk</i> states,
"and he fled <u>and went outside</u>" (<i>Breishis</i> 39:12). The
Gemara (<i>Sotah</i> 36b) explains that Yosef fled from the house only after he
saw the sobering image of his father Yaakov reflected in the window. This is
perhaps hinted to in the word, "<i>vayeitzei</i>" - "<u>and he
went outside</u>," spelled, <i>vuv</i>, <i>yud</i>, <i>tzadi</i>, and <i>aleph</i>,
which is an acronym for "<i>vayare</i> <i>Yosef</i> <i>tzuras</i> <i>aviv</i>
- and Yosef saw the picture of his father." If we can distill precisely
why the familiar vision of Yaakov provided Yosef with the fortitude to resist
the tantalizing temptation of Potiphar's wife, it might provide us with
some guidance in conquering our own personal challenges.</p>

<P>
The Torah describes Yosef's heroic restraint as
"<i>vayimaein</i>" - "and he refused" (<i>Breishis</i>
39:8). The word "<i>vayimaein</i>" appears earlier in <i>Parshas</i>
<i>Vayeishev</i> as well. After Yaakov is presented with the distressing
forensic evidence of Yosef's grisly demise, the <i>pasuk</i> says,
"And all of his sons and daughters attempted to console him, but - '<i>vayimaein</i>
- he refused' to be comforted" (<i>Breishis</i> 37:35). The <i>Ohr
Hachaim</i> <i>Hakadosh</i> claims that Yaakov's children tried to alleviate
his suffering with a demonstration of their abundant and united family.
However, despite the size and solidarity of his family, Yaakov "refused"
to be consoled, because he was unable to cope with the absence of Yosef.</p>

<P>
The <i>Nesivos Shalom</i> suggests that Yaakov was
"<i>vayimaein</i> - he refused" to be comforted because he deeply
believed in Yosef's resiliency and boundless capacity to succeed. Therefore,
he subconsciously concluded that despite all that he had been told, Yosef must
still be alive. The <i>Nesivos Shalom</i> continues, that the word "<i>vayimaein</i>"
is used again later in the <i>parsha</i> to indicate that it was precisely Yosef's
awareness that his father had faith in his prodigious potential and divine
destiny which gave him the strength to refuse the advances of Potiphar's
wife and flee from the house at that pivotal moment in his life. It was the
indelible image of his father's unyielding support and love that enabled
him to prevail in his darkest hour.</p>

<P>
Perhaps it is for this reason that the <i>trup</i>
(musical cantillation note) on the word "<i>vayimaein</i>" is the
rare <i>shalsheles</i>. The <i>shalsheles</i> is in the shape of a zigzagging
line and is pronounced with a prolonged sound which repeatedly goes up and
down. Rav Yosef Ibn Caspi (<i>Mishnah Kesef</i>) postulates that the
fluctuating shape and sound of the <i>shalsheles</i> always indicates an
internal struggle and moral hesitation. In addition, the <i>Alshich</i> <i>Hakadosh
</i>notes that the word <i>shalsheles</i> literally means "a chain."
Therefore, Rav Avi Fishoff suggests that perhaps the <i>shalsheles</i> here
signals that it was specifically the "chain" of tradition and <i>mesorah</i>,
the unbreakable relationship between a father and his son, that rescued Yosef
from drowning in the quicksand of ethical uncertainty and personal doubt, and
enabled him to refuse the seductions of Potiphar's wife.</p>

<P>
Similarly, the Torah (<i>Devarim</i> 21:21) condemns the<i>
ben sorer u'moreh</i> - wayward son to death. The Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>
72a) clarifies that he is not sentenced for his previous indiscretions of overindulging
in meat and wine, but rather in order to forestall the sins that he will
inevitably perform in the future. Even at this early stage, the <i>ben sorer
u'moreh</i> has established that he is beyond any hope for spiritual
rehabilitation. However, the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 88a) qualifies that a <i>ben
sorer u'morah</i> whose parents forgive him for his gluttonous and
drunken conduct is not punished at all. If a <i>ben sorer u'moreh</i> is hopelessly
locked in a destructive religious tailspin, how is the mercy and compassion of
his parents relevant and effective in obtaining a pardon? The <i>Shem Mishmuel</i>
submits that a child who has the unequivocal support and love of his parents will
never be beyond hope for recovery and change. The unconditional loyalty of
parents provides children with the foundation and tools to overcome even the
most daunting challenges and dire circumstances.</p>

<P>
Rav Naftali of Ropshitz (<i>Zera Kodesh</i>)
observes that the word "<i>chalon</i> - window", where Yosef
initially saw the vision of his father Yaakov, is spelled <i>ches</i>, <i>lamed</i>,
<i>vuv</i>, and <i>nun</i>, which is an allusion to the <i>lamed</i>-<i>vuv</i>
(thirty-six) <i>n'eiros ch'anukah</i>. On Chanukah, as we light the
menorah, perhaps Hashem is peaking in through our window, as the <i>pasuk</i>
states, "there he stands behind our wall, gazing through the window, peering
through the lattice" (<i>Shir Hashirim</i> 2:9). Just like Yosef was inspired
by the encouraging image of his father, so too, during Chanukah we must become
emboldened by the knowledge that Hashem trusts that we also have the ability to
triumph and flourish even when we are confronted and surrounded by utter darkness.</p>

<P>Bilaam's threat to <i>Klal Yisroel</i> registers as
unique in many ways. We are enjoined, "My nation remember what Balak
schemed against you and what Bilaam responded...in order that you recognize
G-d's kindness" (Michah 6.) Similarly, "Hashem turned his
curses into blessings, for He loves you" (<i>Devarim</i> 26.)</p>

<P>To the naked eye it seems that Bilaam's threat falls far
short of those of Pharaoh, Amalek, and Sichon, all of whom employed physical
force against us and actually hurt and oppressed us. Bilaam's curses, by
comparison, are just a form of prayer, and if Hashem doesn't want to
listen to those prayers, why are they so significant?</p>

<P>Bilaam's own status is also unclear. He is depicted as
being a prophet (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 106a), similar to, or in the order of, Moshe (<i>Bamidbar
Rabba</i> 14:19.) Was Bilaam good or evil? If he was evil, how could something
as "spiritual" as prophecy become subverted for the bad?</p>

<P>Bilaam is described as a "sorcerer." We really
have little understanding of what this is since we have no personal experience
today with magic, etc. However, we will need to understand what the evil in magic
is - at least conceptually - if we are to have any understanding of "<i>parshas
Bilaam</i>". </p>

<P>We understand the natural order in our physical universe. It
is governed by immutable laws that always are in affect unless Hashem chooses
to override them, as in the case of miracles. There is a higher stratum of
existence that transcends our physical world, which we call the spiritual
world. It is not bound by the constraints of the familiar laws of nature, but
it is also not a world devoid of structure and mechanism. The Maharal explains
many times (especially in <i>Gevuros</i> Hashem) that there is an order and
structure to miracles. This order is why the Talmud has disputes about
miraculous events such as the stopping of the sun at Givon and its duration. Underlying
the dispute are different understandings of the particular nature, not physical
nature but metaphysical nature, of that miraculous event.</p>

<P>Another area where this type of understanding manifests
itself is in the descriptions of the <i>Yom Hadin</i>, and the process of <i>din</i>
in general. We are told about the order of who is judged first, what time of
the day is most auspicious, etc. Even without plumbing and penetrating to the
depths of understanding these details of <i>din</i>, we see that they clearly
indicate that the spiritual world has structure, and only in the most extreme
cases will Hashem override that order and structure (i.e<i>. maavir al midosav</i>.)</p>

<P>Because there are strata of spirituality that have their own
inherent structure and whose system of functioning Hashem does not look to
override on a regular basis, this structure too can be perverted and misused.
This is the realm of magic, which is the tapping into some spiritual level and
perverting it. The power may be spiritual, but rather than being used to bind a
person to Hashem, it is being used to break away from Hashem.</p>

<P>That is the reason why "magic" is so
destructive. Just as a friend who turns against you is so much more dangerous
than someone who was always an enemy because he knows all your vulnerabilities,
so too a person who has heightened spiritual sensitivity and misuses it is a
much more dangerous adversary. Although Hashem can, of course, do as He wishes
and prevent a wicked person from leveraging such spiritual resources just as He
could prevent the wicked from making use of physical resources, He desired that
the world run within a system - be it the physical world or the
"supernatural world". Therefore, a person who is part of a more
spiritual stratum has the choice and ability to do much good, and
commensurately much evil.</p>

<P>Bilaam was the most knowledgeable and spiritually sensitive
of <i>Klal Yisroel</i>'s enemies, and this is precisely why he was the
most dangerous. He could attack <i>Klal Yisroel</i>'s deepest spiritual connection
to Hashem and tried very hard to do so. Rashi describes Balak's choosing
of Bilaam as a desire to utilize Israel's own strength (i.e prayer)
against them. Bilaam was also shrewd enough to realize that seducing Israel to
sin would do more to destroy them than a physical assault. Therefore, to
protect <i>Klal Yisroel</i>, Hashem suspended the normal mechanisms of the
spiritual world. This suspension goes against the deepest wishes of how HKB"H
wants the world to generally run, and thus doing so was an expression of the
love that He has for <i>Klal Yisroel</i>.</p>

<P>We have a hard time really getting a feel for these lofty
concepts and battel grounds because we are removed from the experiences of
"magic", etc. But these ideas are helpful if they can provide
insight into some relatively contemporary phenomena.</p>

<P><i>Klal Yisroel</i> has always had members who drifted away
because of a desire for physical indulgences. It is sad to see anyone in <i>Klal
Yisroel</i> lost, but that type of drifting is not the ultimate tragedy. Let us
look at a much deeper tragedy in the annals of <i>Klal Yisroel</i> - the Jewish
communists. Here were people far more spiritual than the fellow who wanted to
live the good life in Paris and checked out. These communists were people whose
deepest feelings of care for the downtrodden moved them. Their sense of
injustice in the world fired their soul. They were willing to live a life of
total denial and give up their lives for "the cause". Are these not
"spiritual" qualities? Yet these "spiritual" qualities
were turned against Hashem and they produced some of the most destructive eras
in the annals of <i>Klal Yisroel</i>! The relentless persecution of <i>Yiddishkeit</i>,
and its almost total obliteration in the Soviet Union, could only have happened
because the driving force was "spiritual" rather than material.</p>

<P>This <i>parsha</i> teaches us that spirituality, while by
its very nature is closer to the Divine than physicality, is still not
automatically good. It all depends on where those strength and abilities are
aimed. If it is focused on serving as a bridge to Hashem then it is the
"good" itself. But if <i>chas v'shalom</i> it is used to
attack Hashem, it is devastating.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[The <i>Avodah</i> of Yerushalayim, the Connection of Chevron]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Aaron Lopiansky]]></author>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Yerushalayim, introduced at the end of <i>Parshas</i> <i>Vayera</i>
as the location of <i>akeidas</i> Yitzchok, is <i>Klal Yisroel's</i>
holiest site and the focal point of our connection to Hashem. Another
introduction immediately follows at the beginning of <i>Parshas Chayey </i>Sarah,
where we are told about Chevron and its acquisition by Avraham <i>Avinu</i>. The
connection between the two cities run deeper than a superficial juxtaposition
in the text of the <i>Chumash</i>. Chazal tell us that when Sarah <i>Imeinu</i>
found out about the <i>akeidah</i> she passed away. It seems that as soon as Yerushalayim,
the <i>makom haMikdash</i>, was established, Chevron and all that it represents
had to be established as well.</p>

<P>The connection between these two cities is not only
presented to us via their juxtaposition in the <i>Chumash</i>; it finds an
almost eerie echo in the <i>Mishnah</i> as well. The <i>Mishnah</i> (<i>Yoma</i>
3:1) tells us that early Yom Kippur morning the <i>sgan</i> (supervisor Kohen)
would ask if the time to begin the Divine service [i.e. Sunrise] had arrived,
and would pose this question by asking, "Is the whole East light as far
as Chevron?&quot; The <i>Gemara</i> explains that Chevron was mentioned in
order to, "evoke <i>zechus Avos</i> - the merit of our Patriarchs."
Thus, Divine service starts with a mention of the <i>Avos</i>.</p>

<P>Our invoking <i>zechus Avos</i> is not merely an annual
event. The truth is that every <i>tefillah</i> starts with <i>zechus Avos</i>
saying, "The G-d of Avraham, the G-d of Yitzchok, and the G-d of
Yaakov." And even when, in that same first <i>beracha</i>, we speak of
Hashem's praises, we do so by referring to Him as, "the One Who
remembers the deeds of the <i>Avos</i>, and brings the redeemer to their
children's children." This <i>beracha</i> is deemed so important
that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 101) rules that it is the
only <i>beracha</i> which must be repeated if one did not have <i>kavanah</i>
when saying it, and even if one had proper <i>kavanah</i> in every other <i>beracha</i>
one nonetheless must repeat <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>! [The Rema disagrees but only
for pragmatic reasons, not essentially.] It is surely nice to mention the <i>Avos</i>,
and it is wonderful to incorporate their merits into our prayer, but why is it
the most important part of <i>tefillah</i>?</p>

<P>The Rambam describes the appropriate <i>kavanah</i> of <i>tefillah</i>
as being cognizant that, "one is standing before the Divine
Presence" (<i>Hilchos Tefillah</i>, 4:16). Rav Chaim Soloveitchik
demonstrates that it is this <i>kavanah</i>, rather than the meaning of the
words per se, that is the critical <i>kavanah</i> for <i>tefillah</i>. While it
is very important to think of the meaning of the words, failure to do so does
not invalidate one's <i>tefillah</i>. Yet if one failed to focus on being
in front of the Divine Presence, one's <i>tefillah</i> is invalid and
must be redone.</p>

<P>This presents a much greater challenge than we anticipate,
for Hashem has no physical form whatsoever, and it is almost idolatry to
picture him as having one. How is a person to stand "before Hashem"
when the very meaning of those words is so elusive? How does one
"picture" that which has no image? Essentially, this is perhaps our
greatest general challenge in <i>tefillah</i>.</p>

<P>The answer lies in one of the core elements of the
parent-child relationship. A child explores the physical world through his own
sense, but the conceptual world's basic building blocks are transmitted
from parent to child. The concepts of good, justice, responsibility, etc. are
spoken about by parents and absorbed by children. A parent may not provide a
dictionary definition of the word "responsibility" when he uses the
word, but as he says it the tone, body language, context, and so much more are
absorbed by the child. The child may also never have a precise definition of
the word, but he certainly has a strong <u>sense</u> thereof. It is such a
sense of the Divine Presence that looms in front of us when we daven. We may
never have had the experience of an overt Divine encounter personally, but the <i>Avos</i>
did.</p>

<P>Our "sense of the Divine" does not originate
within ourselves, rather it has to come to us via the <i>avos</i>. Rashi makes
this point when he interprets <i>Shemos</i> 15:2, based on the Mechilta, as
follows: "this is the G-d of my father and I will exalt Him &#8211; I am
not the source of this <i>kedusha</i>; it is something established for me from
the days of the <i>Avos</i>."</p>

<P>Every <i>tefillah</i> must start with the sense of "<i>omeid
lifnei haShechinah</i>" or it is not <i>tefillah</i> at all. This sense
is accessible to each and every one of us because we are able to tap into "The
G-d of Avraham, the G-d of Yitzchok, and the G-d of Yaakov", and if we
fail to note that our <i>tefillah</i> is invalid.</p>

<P>Yerushalayim is the location for Divine service, and Chevron
is the repository of the <i>Avos</i>. We cannot properly engage in Divine
service without our connection to the <i>Avos</i>. Therefore, as soon as the
spiritual cornerstone of Yerushalayim was laid via the <i>akeidah</i>, the <i>beracha</i>
of the "G-d of our forefathers" was similarly symbolically
established in Chevron.</p>

<P>The Ponevezher Rav <i>z"tl</i>
after the <i>Shoah</i>, started Yeshivos for the many orphans and called them <i>Batei
Avos</i> as he was looking to raise a new generation of fathers. Once, when
visiting the boys, he asked if anyone knew a reason for the custom of reciting
at the end of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> a verse from <i>Tanach</i> wherein the
opening letter of the verse is the first letter of one's name, and the
last letter of the verse is the last letter of one's name<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. The Ponevezher Rav
<i>z"tl</i> suggested the following answer:</p>

<P>After 120 years when one is
brought before the Divine throne of glory, one is going to forget their name.
The fright is so great, as Abba Kohen Bardela taught (<i>Bereishis Rabbah</i> 93:10)
that just as the brothers could not answer Yosef (<i>Bereishis</i> 45:3) because
they were shocked to find that it was him before them, even more so when one
will have to answer to Hashem he will not be able to reply. The Ponevezher Rav explained
that the one thing you do take with you to the next world is the Torah and <i>mitzvos</i>
that one studied and performed in this world. The recitation of one's
name thrice daily in a <i>passuk</i> will accompany that individual (since
reciting the <i>passuk</i> constitutes an act of learning Torah) and will
remind him of his name. </p>

<P>The concept that one's
spiritual wealth that they amassed in one's lifetime is the only
possession one takes to the next world is found explicitly in <i>Parshas Nasso</i>
according to the <i>Chofetz Chaim</i>. The Torah states, "<i>ish es
kadashav lo yehiyeh</i> - a man's holies shall be his, what a person
gives to the Kohen shall be his" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 5:10.) All of
one's material acquisitions are by nature transient and temporary, as the
saying goes: there are no pockets in <i>tachrichim</i> (burial shrouds.)</p>

<P>This is found clearly in Talmud (<i>Bava
Basra</i> 11a) regarding King Munbaz, who according to Rashi was the son of
Queen Helena, one of the Hasmonean Kings. We are taught that during years of
famine he opened his storehouses and treasuries and supported the poor. He was
severely criticized by family members because unlike the royalty before him
that added to the family fortune, he was depleting the family fortune. He
answered with three points: 1. My fathers hoarded wealth below, on Earth, while
I have hoarded wealth above, in Heaven 2. My family gathered wealth in an
insecure place, and I have accumulated wealth in a most secure environment 3.
My forefathers stored something that does not produce fruits, but I have
hoarded something that does produce fruit.</p>

<P>Moreover, this concept is
explicitly taught in <i>Avos</i> (6:9) by Reb Yosi <i>ben</i> Kismah in
explaining why he refused a lucrative Ravnic position in a not yet religious
community. As part of his rejection, he explained that, "when a man
departs from this world, neither silver, nor gold, nor precious stones, nor
pearls escort him, but only Torah study, and good deeds, as it is said, (<i>Proverbs</i>
6:22) 'when you walk it shall guide you, when you lie down, it shall
guard you, and when you are awake, it shall speak on your behalf.' When
you walk it shall guide you in this world, when you lie down it shall guard you
in the gRave, and when you awake it shall speak on your behalf in the world to
come."</p>

<P>The Chofetz Chaim <i>zt"l</i>
presented the following parable in the name of our Sages: a man had 3 friends,
the first he was closest with, loved him, and thought the feelings were mutual.
The second he also considered close, but not like the first. The third he had
associations with, but not as strong as his connections to the others. One day
the man was summoned suddenly to the king. He was not told the reason for his
urgent appearance before the king, but he was exceedingly frightened to go
alone. He asked his first and closest friend to accompany him and to his great
surprise, he was refused. The second closest friend agreed to go, but only to
the palace gates. In desperation he approached the third friend, and much to
his surprise he not only agreed willingly and cheerfully to accompany him to
the king but agreed to vouch for and present a most complimentary presentation
on his behalf before the king.</p>

<P>The meaning of the above is
obvious. The fortune and all material possessions that one invests time and
effort amassing are too often that first friend - they flatly refuse to
accompany a person to the next world. The second friend is representative of
one's family - they tearfully can only accompany a person until the
gRave. However, that last friend, whom he did not realize how loyal he is, is his
Torah study, <i>mitzvos</i>, and good deeds, which excitedly accompany you and
endorse on your behalf.</p>

<P>Finally, I'd like to
suggest that this is further communicated by King David, (<i>Tehillilm</i> 139:5),
"<i>achor vakedem tzartani</i> - back and front have you formed
me." The Radak understands <i>kedem</i> - back, to refer to the formation
of the embryo in the mother's womb. The Talmud (<i>Niddah</i> 30b)
teaches that the baby in utero is taught Torah. The <i>neshama</i> of man is
surrounded by Torah prior to birth, and the many sources cited above affirm
that the soul is protected by Torah in the next world. It is thus understood
that the Talmud (<i>Pesachim</i> 54a) lists Torah as the first of the seven
supernatural phenomena created prior to this world, as it truly is beyond this
world in every sense of the word.</p>

<hr align=left size=1 width="33%">

<p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>
This practice is found in <i>Sefer Ha'Kavanot Ha'ari</i>, it is
said to be helpful in preventing <i>chibut ha'kever</i>, is attributed to
the <i>Kitzur Shelah</i>, and is found in the <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i> (<i>Orach
Chaim</i> 122:8).</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vaera]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The wise King Solomon notes (Koheles 7:14) that Hashem
always presents us with choice and sharp contrast. For example, the <i>Anshei Kneses
HaGedolah</i> (Men of the Great Assembly) prayed for His Divine assistance to
remove the attraction and addiction to idolatry and their prayer was answered
in the affirmative, therefore we don't have that attraction and ask
ourselves how it was possible for intelligent people to subscribe to idolatry. Why
was the <i>yetzer hara</i> for idolatry created to begin with? An answer is
that when the first <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> was in existence, where one saw the
presence of Hashem daily (see <i>Avos</i> 5:8), the lure of idolatry was
necessary to give man choice and free will.</p>

<P>Similarly, we encounter in <i>Parshas Vaera</i> a phenomenon
whereby Pharaoh experiences the plague of blood and all its severe consequences
and yet, "<i>V'lo shos libo</i>" (<i>Shemos</i> 7:23) - he is
able to ignore it and suspend the natural instinct of self- preservation such
that it did not override his personal defiance of Hashem. Pharaoh has the
ability to blot out the past and ignore its consequences.</p>

<P>In sharp contrast to Pharaoh is the leader of the Jewish
people, Amram (<i>Rambam Hilchos Melachim</i> 9:1). The Shalah in this
week's <i>parsha</i> tells us to note the difference in how the Torah
presents the genealogy of the tribes of Reuven and Shimon in contrast to that
of Levi. The former is listed (6:14) by the heads of their tribes. Regarding
Levi the Torah calls attention to the names of his progeny - "Note the
names of the descendents of Levi" (6:16). The tribe of Levi was not
included in the Egyptian servitude. Levi foresaw with Divine inspiration the
impending oppressive exile and named his three sons, Gershon, Kehas, and Merari
to be ever mindful of the dangers facing the Jewish nation. Amram and Yocheved
lived during this horrific era, and to always remember the plight of the rest
of the tribes they named their daughter Miriam - bitter. They were "<i>shos
libo</i>", they remembered constantly by articulating and calling their
daughter's name; they shared the pain and suffering of others.</p>

<P>The Torah, by presenting Pharaoh's "<i>lo shos</i>"
and Amram's usage of a constant reminder, teaches us how easy it is for
man to forget. Therefore the Torah builds into the very fabric of our lives the
antidote to forgetting, by legislating and implementing constant reminders.
Even Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i> was afraid of forgetting. The Ramban (<i>Shemos</i> 4:10)
teaches that since the origin of Moshe's speech defect came about in a
miraculous way, i.e. from the angel moving baby Moshe's hand from the
gold to the coals (<i>Shemos Rabbah</i> 1:26), Moshe did not ask Hashem to cure
him of this deficiency so that he would always remember Hashem's kindness. The <i>Sefer
haChinuch</i> (420) in discussing the <i>mitzvah</i> to recite the Shemah, our
pledge of allegiance, twice daily, explains that fragile man who is easily
swayed from his spiritual pursuits needs the twice daily reminder of
Hashem's sovereignty. In addition, in <i>mitzvah</i> 421 in explaining
the mitzvah of <i>Tefillin</i> he again writes that man in all times is drawn
to satisfy his bodily pleasures and needs, and therefore requires the daily
reminder of donning <i>Tefillin</i> that protects the soul from defilement.</p>

<P>The Torah alludes to the Exodus from Egypt no less than
fifty times to literally ingrain in the Jewish nation the thirteen principles
of faith as articulated by the Rambam, each of which is found in the Exodus.
Every morning and night we are reminded of His being the Creator, as exhibited
by His manipulation of nature during the Exodus. We are reminded of His love
for His people Israel, demonstrated by endowing millions of people with
prophecy, and giving us His Torah at Sinai. </p>

<P>Man was created needy. Interestingly, in the <i>beracha</i>
of <i>Boreh Nefashos</i> that we often recite daily, we thank Hashem for creating
man and his being needy, "<i>v'chesronon</i>." The <i>beracha</i>
continues, "for You sustain all living beings, blessed is the Life of
Worlds". The Aruch haShulchan explains the closing words of the <i>beracha</i>,
"blessed is the Sustainer of the worlds", to mean that He provides
us in this world by giving us nourishment, and our recognition of the fact that
this nourishment comes from Him acquires for us a share in the next world,
hence the last word ("worlds") being plural.</p>

<P>Among the needs of man is the need for constant reminders.
Hashem endowed man with the gift of both memory and forgetfulness. On the one
hand, forgetting is oftentimes a blessing. One who experiences a tragedy, such
as the loss of a child, <i>Rachmana litzlan</i>, or a spouse, could not
continue their lives without the ability to somewhat forget. On the other hand,
man forgets too often what is to be his focus and concern in this world. The
Dubner <i>Maggid</i> highlights this idea when commenting on the verse (<i>Devarim</i>
32:18), "you forget the G-d that formed you." He notes that Hashem
gives man the gift of forgetfulness and man misuses this gift by forgetting Hashem
and His laws.</p>

<P>Each and every generation faces its own unique challenges.
Our extremely open liberal society generates its crises. Just as one can
appreciate the probation of <i>yichud</i> and how it safeguards Jewish moral
values, one must realize that there can be an <i>isur yichud</i> with a
computer. One's self control today provides no assurance for the future.
"Who is the wise one? - the one that can see the future" (<i>Avos</i>
4:1). The wise one today is he who insures that the forbidden will not be seen
in the future.</p>

<P>Finally, it is very considerate that one put their cell phone
on vibrate when davening in Shul since they are respecting the needs of those
around them and refraining from disturbing them. But what about themselves? As
much as one wishes to ignore the vibrate, the momentary reflection of who might
that be is a forbidden intrusion on our <i>tefillah</i> (see <i>Orach Chaim</i>
90.)</p>

<P>Hashem promises (<i>Vayikra</i> 26:42) that He will always
remember His covenant and the land of Israel. We owe it to Him to reciprocate
in kind and always be mindful of Him.</p>

<P>This Shabbos represents the resiliency of the Jewish nation.
Six days ago, we sat on the floor as mourners, engulfed by despondency and
despair, and today enveloped in an atmosphere of optimism. The excitement comes
not only from the <i>parsha</i> of <i>Vaeschanan</i> with its many basic <i>mitzvos</i>
of <i>talmud</i> Torah, <i>tefillin</i>, <i>mezuzah</i>, and the <i>Aseres
Hadibros</i>, as well as the prohibition against intermarriage. The optimism is
not only from the <i>haftorah</i> where the <i>navi</i> Yeshaya promises us
that as we were persecuted most severely, so will we be comforted. The
additional optimism comes from today being <i>Tu b'Av</i>, the fifteenth day of
the month of Av. The Talmud at the end of <i>Taanis</i> and <i>Bava Basra</i>
(125a-125b) enumerates six phenomena that occurred on this day that make its
significance and joy comparable to that of Yo<i>m Kippur</i>.</p>

<P>The last factor contributing to the uniqueness of this day
is that it marked the culmination of bringing the wood for the fire on the <i>mizbeach</i>.
The Torah (<i>Vayikra</i> 6:6) legislates that there is to be an <i>aish tamid</i>
- a perpetual fire ablaze on the altar. The Talmud (<i>Yuma</i> 21b) informs us
that in actuality there were three fires on the <i>mizbeach</i>: The largest
one was to consume the meat sacrifices, the second largest fire was to provide
the coals with which to light and offer the incense on the golden altar in the <i>heichal</i>,
and the third one was to fulfill the Divine directive of having the perpetual
fire that should not be extinguished.</p>

<P>There is a recurring metaphysical theme throughout many of
the <i>mitzvos</i> according to the understanding of the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>.
His basic thesis is that <i>chesed</i> to one's fellow man and giving to
Hashem is in reality a boomerang and ultimately benefits the donor. Allow me to
explain. Man, by his very nature, is limited both materialistically and
spiritually. His actions are therefore limited as well. The concept of a <i>bracha</i>
is to break through the limits of man's actions by giving and attributing
a portion to Hashem, which then limitless just like its Master is, thereby allowing
<i>bracha</i> to settle on its object and expand limitlessly. Thus, when the
Jewish nation provides the <i>lechem hapanim</i> weekly, fulfilling, "on
the Table shall you place show-bread before Me always" (<i>Shemos</i> 25:30),
our giving and offering Him bread allows Him to bless our bread and sustenance
(see <i>Chinuch</i>, <i>mitzvah</i> 97.)</p>

<P>Interestingly, the <i>Chinuch</i> (mitzvah 132), explaining
the significance of our kindling a fire on the altar even though in the time of
the first <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> fire miraculously descended from Heaven, says
that man is comprised of four elements: dust, water, wind, and fire. The wood
cut between Nisan and Tu b'Av is dried by the intense heat of the sun,
preventing the wood from becoming wormy and thus providing the best flammable
material. Once the wood has been severed, it goes from <i>tzomeach</i> - that
which grows, to <i>domeim</i> - a lifeless object, and as Hashem accepts this
wood and allows it to fuel the <i>mizbeach</i>, He then takes our <i>domeim</i>
- lifeless element, the dust within us, and lights our fire. As the burning
fire on the altar is beautiful to see and practical, so too does He take our
personal fire, our drive for life, and calibrates it. Too much fire in man will
consume him, anger him constantly and will not allow him to interact patiently
and harmoniously with others. Too little fire will leave man without principles,
without determination, a wimp. Thus our <i>hiddur</i> <i>mitzvah</i> which is
accomplished by finishing this <i>mitzvah</i> by Tu b'Av to ensure the
highest quality wood, gains us His blessings in return.</p>

<P>There is a moving <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> at the very end of <i>V'zos
Habracha</i> that describes Moshe leaving the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>bizuy</i>
Mitzrayim (gathering the wealth of Egypt), and for three days and three nights
searching for the bones of Yosef. Pharaoh's advisors told him that if he
doesn't want the Israelites to leave he should hide the bones of Yosef since
they pledged not to leave without his remains, and they will surely be loyal to
their pledge! Exhausted, Moshe meets Serach the daughter of Asher. Seeing Moshe
totally fatigued and inquiring why, she then takes him to the shores of the
Nile, where Yosef had been buried deep in the waters in a heavy casket to
ensure that the Jewish nation would not leave. The rest is history. Moshe prays
and Hashem delivers, but only after Moshe extends his greatest effort in this
project. The lesson is clear: we have to put in our maximum effort and He will
respond in kind.</p>

<P>In the <i>Nachem</i> prayer we recited on Tisha b'Av
we conclude, "for You, Hashem, consumed her, and with fire You will
rebuild her." I'd like to suggest that since we, the Jewish nation,
took the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> for granted and did not bring our fire/enthusiasm
to the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, it became a lifeless shell lacking the soul and
fire of the Jewish people, and therefore it was consumed with natural fire. We
pray that in the near future, in the merit of our studying and appreciating the
<i>korban eitzim</i> (the wood donations) and our pining and longing to fulfill
this <i>mitzvah</i> as well as all other <i>mitzvos</i> related to the Beis HaMikdash,
this fire and enthusiasm will speedily cause the rebuilding of the third <i>Beis
HaMikdash</i> in our days.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>On his journey down to Egypt, still in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>,
Yaakov has a dream which contains a most magnificent prophecy. The Bais HaLevi
calls the promise of Hashem to Yaakov the "Greatest Promise of All",
namely that Hashem was inextricably binding Himself with the destiny of <i>Klal
Yisrael</i>. This promise says that Hashem will only alter the laws of nature
for the benefit of <i>Am Yisrael</i>. When a situation arises and the Jewish
people are in great danger and in need of salvation, He will reveal Himself to
the entire world and rescue the descendants of Yaakov.</p>

<P>The Bais HaLevi understands the <i>passuk</i> (46:2) "I
shall descend with you to Egypt" to mean that Hashem was declaring, "when
you, the Jewish people, are down, low in stature, subjugated and persecuted, so
am I!" As it says Psalms (91:15) "I am with him in distress." Note
Hashem referring to himself as "<i>Anochi</i>." Conversely, the <i>passuk</i>'s
next statement, "I shall also surely bring you up," not only means Hashem
will literally bring us up and out of Egypt, but also that the glory and honor
of Hashem will be elevated and exalted throughout the world through the process
of the Exodus.</p>

<P>Indeed, this is how the Bais HaLevi understands the essence
of the <i>shira</i> sung by <i>Bnei Yisrael</i> upon their miraculous
deliverance following the splitting of the Red Sea. It is not until the last <i>passuk</i>
that they proclaim that the Jewish people went on dry land amidst the sea. The preceding
eighteen <i>pesukim</i> are a proud proclamation of thanksgiving to Hashem for
choosing them as the vehicle by which His name and glory were exalted
throughout the entire world. This is clearly stated in the <i>shira</i>, "peoples
heard they were agitated, terror gripped the dwellers of Philistia" (<i>Shemos</i>
15:14.) Similarly, Rachav tells the two spies sent by Yehoshua, "For we
have heard how Hashem dried up the water of the Sea of Reeds" (Yehoshua 2:10.)</p>

<P>In addition, the miraculous deliverance of Chananel,
Mishael, and Azaria from the furnace of Nevuchadnezer (Daniel 3:25) is another
example of Hashem's fulfilling His promise to Yaakov. The magnificent glow of
the eight lights of Chanukah are still most fresh in our memories, as well as
the recitation of <i>she'asa nisim</i> - He wrought miracles for our
forefathers. We believe there were two miracles to save the Jewish people. The
first being the military victory as the few prevailed over the many. Lest one
not assess that victory as a miracle, Hashem performed the miracle of the oil
to illuminate and clearly abide by His promise to Yaakov of saving Israel and
proclaiming His absolute authority over nature which He created.</p>

<P>It is thus most understandable that Hashem introduced the
revelation at Sinai with the word "Anochi", the same pronoun that He
used with Yaakov, as here too the whole world was aware that a revelation, a
change in the natural order of this world, was performed on behalf of <i>Klal
Yisrael</i> once again bringing glory to His essence.</p>

<P>What is somewhat challenging, however, is the dialogue at
the burning bush. For almost a week's time, Hashem urged Moshe to accept the
position of leadership and lead the slaves to freedom. Aside from Moshe's
humility and his sensitivity to his older brother, Moshe protests and says,
"<i>mi Anochi</i>?" (<i>Shemos</i> 3:11), which literally means
"who am I that I should go to Pharaoh?" However, in view of the
above, Moshe could very well be protesting and asking, "You said <i><u>anochi</u>
a'alcha</i>, i.e. that You, Hashem, would raise them up, so who am I to go?"
Hashem answers, "for I shall be with you" (3:12.) There are times,
and indeed most often, that Hashem works His wonders through man.</p>

<P>Indeed, on that great day, November 29, 1947, a man sat in
the chair presiding over the United Nations as that momentous historical role
call took place. Who was sitting in that chair? If your answer is President
Oranha of Brazil, you are only half right. The Rav <i>zt"l</i> suggested
in his essay <i>Kol Dodi Dofek</i> that it was none other than <i>Anochi</i>.</p>

<P>The promise of Hashem to Yaakov is really both a privilege
and a charge that each member of <i>Klal Yisrael</i> has to bring honor and
glory to His great name. We close every <i>tefillah</i> with <i>Aleinu</i>.
Upon reflection, what is the essence of "<i>Aleinu l'shabeach</i>"?
Have we not been praising Hashem throughout the davening!? I believe that until
<i>Aleinu</i> our prayers both praise Him and make requests of Him. Now, as we
are about to take formal leave of Him, of the <i>bais haknesses</i>, we are
declaring that "<i>Aleinu l'shabeach</i>", we have a mission, "<i>l'saken
olam b'malchus Shaddai</i>", to enhance and perfect this world under the
sovereignty of the Almighty. Our honest practices in business, our pleasant
demeanor in interacting with people, our <i>shalom bayis</i> at home all serve
to create a greater manifestation of His <i>Anochi</i> in this world. The <i>Kaddish</i>
which is recited by the surviving male relatives after the passing of their
loved one in essence states: in his lifetime, my relative, through his
character and actions, brought a <i>Kiddush</i> Hashem into this world. With his
passing there is a void. I will therefore attempt to bring <i>yisgadal
v'yiskadash</i> into this world.</p>

<P>Until now we have been focusing on the <i>Anochi</i> and
society. The <i>Nefesh HaChayim</i> (2:11) asks that if we believe that
suffering is beneficial for man, cleansing him of transgression, what right do
we have to request of Hashem that it be removed when one is suffering? He
answers based upon the Talmud (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 46a) in the name of Rav Meir,
that when man suffers here, Hashem as well feels that pain and suffering. The
context there in the Talmud is when a criminal is executed this pains Hashem,
all the more so when the righteous suffer. So, in essence, our prayer for the
removal of suffering is also <i>l'chvod Shamayim</i>, for His honor.</p>

<P>When we had a <i>Bais Hamikdash</i> it was not only a place
that unified all Jews, bringing them together for the three pilgrim festivals;
it was not only a place that one could bring a <i>korban</i>, and get closer to
Hashem. It was a place where the whole world saw constant miracles (see <i>Avos</i>
5:7) proclaiming His sovereignty and dominion over this world. Our fasting this
forthcoming Tuesday, <i>Asara b'Tevet</i>, which marks the beginning of the end
of the first <i>Bais Hamikdash</i>, is a reminder to us of what we are missing
and an opportunity to daven and pine for its speedy return.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: pesach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Generally, <i>Chazal</i> advise us to be defined by our
actions and not by our words, as the Mishna states "say little and do a
lot" (<i>Avos</i> 1:15). However, a notable exception to this rule is the
night of the <i>seder</i>, when the Haggadah exhorts, "whoever talks excessively
about the exodus from <i>Mitzrayim</i> is praiseworthy." Similarly, the
matzah is described as "<i>lechem <u>oni</u></i> - the bread of
affliction" (<i>Devarim</i> 16:3) which could also be read as "the
bread of responses," from which the Gemara (<i>Pesachim</i> 36a) derives
that the matzah should be the topic of great and lengthy conversation, "<i>lechem
she'<u>onim</u> alav devarim harbei</i> - the bread about which many
answers are offered." The Arizal has observed that even the name of the <i>yom
tov</i> of "Pesach" itself, can be deconstructed to form two words,
"<i>peh sach</i> - a mouth which is speaking", because throughout Pesach
our mouths should be working tirelessly to recount the story of <i>yetziyas</i>
<i>Mitzrayim</i>. The month during which Pesach occurs is the month of <i>Nissan</i>,
which has the numerical equivalent of one hundred and seventy, or two times eighty-five,
which is the numerical value of the word "<i>peh</i> - mouth." This
underscores the message that during the month of <i>Nissan</i>, and
particularly on Pesach, our mouths should be operating on overdrive, speaking twice
as much as usual, in delving into the miracles of the exodus.</p>

<P>Most of our discussions regarding <i>yetziyas Mitzrayim</i>
are concentrated in the <i>Maggid</i> section of the Haggadah, which is
introduced with the words "<i>ha lachma</i> - this is the bread,"
which also has the numerical value of eighty-five, and the word "<i>peh</i>,"
prompting us to be prepared to open our mouths immanently in conversation. Moreover,
the formal beginning of <i>Maggid</i> opens with the letter <i>mem</i>, in the
word "<i>mah</i> - why," and closes with a <i>mem</i> <i>sofit</i>,
an ending <i>mem</i>, in the word "<i>mayim</i>" at the conclusion
of the first part of <i>Hallel</i>. This is analogous to the Torah <i>She'baal
Peh</i> itself which opens with the letter <i>mem</i>, in the word "<i>mei'eimasai</i>,"
at the beginning of <i>Berachos</i>, and closes with a <i>mem sofit</i>, in the
word "<i>shalom</i>," at the conclusion of <i>Uktzin</i>. The
letter <i>mem</i> is one of the four letters in the <i>aleph</i> <i>beis</i>
which are formed with the lips, along with the letters, <i>beis</i>, <i>vuv</i>,
and <i>peh</i>. The <i>Maggid</i> section of the Haggadah, and the Mishnah commence
with the letter <i>mem</i> which is produced with the lips as an indication,
that we should seek to open our lips and mouths to a greater degree when speaking
and engaged in learning Torah and retelling the story of <i>yetziyas</i> <i>Mitzrayim</i>.
The <i>mem sofit</i> at the end, encourages us, to be to be more discerning and
economical with what we say and how much we speak after we have concluded
learning Torah and discussing <i>yetziyas</i> <i>Mitzrayim</i>.</p>

<P>When addressing the fourth son in the Haggadah, the one who
does not even know how to ask, the Haggadah prescribes, "<i>at pesach lo</i>
- you should initiate with him." However, here the narrator of the
Haggadah transitions from the masculine "<i>ata</i>" to the
feminine "<i>at</i>", which is curious. This leads the <i>Divrei</i>
<i>Chaim</i>, to suggest that in fact the word "<i>at</i>" is an
acronym for "<i>a'leph</i>...<i>t'af</i>", which coaches
us to exhaust the entire lexicon, dictionary, and thesaurus, all the way from
the letter aleph, at beginning of the <i>aleph beis</i>, to the letter <i>taf</i>
at the end of the <i>aleph</i> <i>beis</i>, in order to engage the children at
the <i>seder</i> and inspire them with our description of <i>yetziyas</i> <i>Mitzrayim</i>.
A short while later, we raise our glasses of wine and declare, "<i>vehi
she'adma le'avoseinu ve'lanu</i> - and <u>this</u> is what
has stood for us" and preserved us throughout the diaspora and saved us
from mortal danger. The item referred to in this proclamation, "<i>vehi</i>
- and <u>this</u>," is vague and one of the classical mysteries of the <i>seder</i>
which is the subject of voluminous speculation. However, perhaps on some level
the word "<i>vehi</i>", which has the numerical value of twenty-two,
is an allusion to the twenty-two letters of the <i>aleph</i> <i>beis</i> which
we must utilize completely in speaking with and educating our children on the
night of the <i>seder</i> regarding our beliefs and practices, and it is
precisely this endeavor which has secured our continuity and survival from
generation to generation.</p>

<P>Why do we exaggerate speaking and talking to such an
unusual degree on the night of the <i>seder</i>? Perhaps it is because we were
only exiled to <i>Mitrzayim</i> in the first place as a result of harmful and
destructive speech. When Yitzchak was born, Sarah approached Avraham <i>Avinu</i>
and urged him to "evict this handmaid (Hagar) and her son" (<i>Breishis</i>
21:10), lest Yishmael have a harmful influence on Yitzchok. The <i>Baal</i> <i>Haturim</i>
claims that since Sarah spoke in an exceptionally harsh fashion towards Hagar,
the Jewish people were punished that they too would be driven from their home.
In accordance with Hashem's usual method of administering justice in-kind,
Sarah's descendants were exiled specifically to <i>Mitzrayim</i>, which
was the birthplace of Hagar. Rav Shlomo Kluger (<i>Yeriyos</i> <i>Shlomo</i>), suggests
that this is the meaning of the assertion in the Haggadah that we descended to <i>Mitrzrayim</i>
"trapped by the speech." This phrase is generally interpreted as a
reference to Hashem's verbal bond with Avraham <i>Avinu</i>, "and
your children will be strangers in a foreign land" (<i>Breishis</i> 15:13)
which compelled our deportation and servitude. However, Rav Shlomo Kluger
argues that it also refers to Sarah's severe tone in speaking with Hagar,
which further induced our expulsion and held us prisoner in <i>Mitzrayim</i>.</p>

<P>But more directly, Yaakov and his sons originally tRaveled
to <i>Mitzrayim</i> only as a result of the sale of Yosef. For this reason, the
<i>seder</i> begins with <i>karpas</i>, the first dipping of the night. <i>Rabbeinu</i>
Manoach contends that this dipping serves as a reminder of the first dipping recorded
in the Torah, when the <i>shevatim</i> dipped Yosef's coat in the blood
of a goat (<i>Breishis</i> 37:31) in order to deceive and mislead their father.
This is supported by Rashi (<i>Breishis</i> 37:3) who defines Yosef's
coat as a garment made from material "similar to <i>karpas</i> and <i>techeiles</i>."
Additionally, the seder finishes with the cryptic <i>chad</i> <i>gadya</i>
parable, which centers around a pivotal goat who is sold for two <i>zuzim</i>.
Rav Asher Weiss proposes that this too is an allusion to Yosef and his fateful
coat that was worth two <i>selaim</i> (<i>Shabbos</i> 10b), which aroused the
jealousy of his brothers and led to his kidnaping and sale at their hands. The
Torah attests that when Yosef "spoke evil tales about them to their
father" (<i>Breishis</i> 37:2), the <i>shevatim</i> began to despise Yosef
to the point that "they could no longer speak with him peacefully"
(<i>Breishis</i> 37:4). The dysfunctional relationship between Yosef and his
brothers, that facilitated the Jewish people's initial descent to <i>Mitzrayim</i>,
deteriorated so dramatically and tragically because of a breakdown of peaceful
and positive speech. Therefore, it is not surprising that the only way to leave
<i>Mitzrayim</i> on the <i>seder</i> night, is to rehabilitate our speech and talk
our way out of it. On the night of the <i>seder</i> we accentuate talking to a
greater degree than usual, because we are attempting to cleanse our power of
speech by channeling our words towards praising Hashem, learning Torah, and
welcoming others.</p>

<p>The mouth and our ability to speak were designed expressly for the
purpose of holy speech and engaging in Torah learning. The <i>Shelah Hakadosh</i>
cites the <i>Rokeach</i> that there are thirty-two teeth in the mouth, sixteen
above and sixteen below, corresponding to the sixteen <i>aliyos</i> of Torah
reading we participate in each week, (seven Shabbos morning, three Shabbos
afternoon, three on Monday, and three on Thursday), because our mouths were
intended deliberately to enable weekly and daily Torah learning. Similarly, the
five areas in the mouth where letters are formed, the throat, palate, tongue,
teeth, and lips, are related to the five books of the Torah which we should be
discussing incessantly. The Bluzhever Rebbe (<i>Tzvi LeTzaddik</i>) suggests
that these five areas in which letters are enunciated are the basis for the
five expressions of redemption mentioned by the Torah in connection with <i>yetziyas
Mitzrayim</i>, "I shall take you out", "I shall rescue you",
"I shall redeem you", "I shall take you", and "I
shall bring you")<i>Shemos</i> 6:6-8), as well as the five illustrations
of emancipation and salvation contained within the Haggadah, "from
slavery to freedom, from sorrow to joy, from mourning to festivity, from deep darkness
to great light, and from bondage to redemption." If we immerse ourselves
verbally in the story of <i>yetziyas Mitzrayim</i> and <i>limmud</i> <i>haTorah</i>
on the seder night, may we be able to purge our mouths from all aspects of
negative speech, and may we merit to attain and experience all of the five
manifestations of redemption, culminating with "and I will bring you to
the land" so that we may be able to celebrate Pesach next year in
Yerushalayim!</p>

<P> "The entire <i>mitzvah</i> that I am commanding
you today you should keep to do it" (<i>Devarim</i> 8:1). Rashi cites the
Medrash which derives from the word "entire," that one who begins a
<i>mitzvah</i> should be careful to complete it, because the credit for a <i>mitzvah</i>
is not awarded or assigned until it is concluded. For this reason, even though
Moshe was the primary impetus in returning Yosef's bones to <i>Eretz
Yisrael</i>, the <i>pasuk</i> (<i>Yehoshua</i> 24:32) attributes all of the
credit for the <i>mizvah</i> to the entirety of the Jewish people, since they were
the ones who oversaw and facilitated its completion. In fact, the Steipler <i>Gaon</i>
(<i>Birchas</i> <i>Peretz</i>) notes that the numerical value of the phrase
from this <i>pasuk</i>, "<i>mitzavcha ha'yom tishimrun</i>" -
"commanding you today you should keep to do it," is analogous to
the value of the words "<i>maschil be'mitzvah omrim lo gemor</i>"
- "one who begins a <i>mitzvah</i> is encouraged to complete it." </p>

<P> The Gemara (<i>Sotah</i> 13b) adds that one who begins
a <i>mitzvah</i> without completing it not only forfeits any potential credit
for the <i>mitzvah</i>, but also places themselves in spiritual danger and risks
losing the confidence of their family and community. Rav Binyamin of Zolishitz
(<i>Turei Zahav</i>) compares it to a broken <i>shidduch</i> which can
transform feelings of affection and excitement into animosity and
disappointment, where the heightened anticipation itself only intensifies and
deepens the frustration when the relationship is dissolved. Similarly, when one
embarks upon on an ambitious spiritual mission to come close to Hashem, as set
of infectious expectations are generated not only by the person himself, but by
his family and group of supporters. If the <i>mitzvah</i> is subsequently
abandoned, everyone around him might become disheartened and confused, which
can lead them to begin to doubt his abilities and convictions in other areas as
well.</p>

<P> Moreover, the <i>Medrash</i> tells us that at the end
of the sixth day of creation, Hashem was in the midst of fashioning additional
human beings, however, He was interrupted by the onset of Shabbos. It was those
truncated human beings, with souls but no bodies, that ultimately became the <i>sheidim</i>,
or spiritual demons. The <i>Alter</i> of Kelm derives from here, that it is
specifically our aborted or unfinished projects which can produce demons of
regret that haunt a person throughout the rest of his life. Similarly, the <i>pasuk</i>
states, "Beware of ascending the mountain or touching its edge, for whoever
touches the mountain shall surely die" (<i>Shemos</i> 19:12). The Kotzker
<i>Rebbe</i> creatively interprets the <i>pasuk</i> as follows: Beware of embarking
upon bold ventures, such as climbing a mountain, if you suspect that you will might
only be able to touch its edge. For if you come up short, if you will only be
able to touch the mountain but not ascend to the top, there can be toxic and
damaging consequences.</p>

<P> The hallmark of <i>tzaddikim</i> and great people, is
that they follow through with their plans. The <i>pasuk</i> states in
connection with Avraham, "and they set out for the land of Canaan, and
they arrived in the land of Canaan" (<i>Breishis</i> 12:5). Once we are
told that Avraham arrived safely in the land of Canaan, why does the Torah
bother to inform us that Avraham initially set out for the land of Canaan? The
Chafetz Chaim claims that this <i>pasuk</i> must be contrasted with an almost
identical <i>pasuk</i> earlier in the Torah, where the <i>pasuk</i> states in
connection with Terach, "and they set out together etc. for the land of
Canaan, but they came to Charan and they settled there" (<i>Breishis</i>
11:31). Both Terach and Avraham initially hoped to take a spiritual pilgrimage
to the land of Canaan, because they both aspired to come close to Hashem.
However, it was only Avraham who followed through with his plans, who achieved
his goals, whereas Terach got stuck and settled somewhere along the way.</p>

<P> Therefore, instead of conjuring up excessively elaborate
and ambitious plans for spiritual growth that will undoubtably prove difficult
to achieve, it is preferable to have more realistic religious goals and
checkpoints even if they might be less sensational and glamorous. Indeed, the
path of authentic <i>avodas</i> Hashem is paved with lots of more modest
accomplishments that can only tRaversed by taking small steps.</p>

<P><i> Parshas Eikev</i> begins "<i>vehaya <u>eikev</u> tishmaun</i>" - "And it will
be if you will heed these laws" (<i>Devarim</i> 7:12). The word "<i>eikev</i>"
- "if" can also refer to the "heel" of the foot. Therefore,
Rashi comments that the Torah here is stressing the significance of the weak or
little <i>mitzvos</i> that we regularly trample upon with our heel. Rav Asher
Weiss (<i>Minchas</i> <i>Asher</i>) emphasizes that of course there are no
"little" <i>mitzvos</i>, because all positive commandments are
equally important and sublime as the Mishnah (<i>Avos</i> 2:1) describes. The
only "little" <i>mitzvos</i> are those <i>mitzvos</i> that we
choose to devalue or disregard, (see also the Rambam's commentary to <i>Avos</i>).
Unfortunately, we tend to emphasize and concentrate disproportionately upon the
occasional or spectacular <i>mitzvos</i>, such as blowing the <i>shofar</i>,
shaking the <i>lulav</i>, eating <i>matzah</i>, or celebrating a <i>siyum</i>, while
neglecting or discounting the daily <i>mitzvos</i>, which are regularly
available and more easily attainable. However, in truth, it is the cumulative
effect of many smaller achievements, such as davening, learning Torah daily, <i>tzedakah</i>,
and <i>chesed</i> that are the backbone of substantial and sustained spiritual
growth.</p>

<P> This is perhaps highlighted by the fact, that the <i>parsha</i>
that we read on Shabbos<i> Shuva</i>, the Shabbos in between Rosh Hashanah and
Yom Kippur, is invariably the shortest <i>keriyas</i> <i>haTorah</i> of any
Shabbos throughout the entire year. On those years when Yom Kippur falls out
during the week, on <i>Shabbos Shuva</i> we read <i>Parshas Vayeilech,</i> the
shortest <i>parsha</i> in the Torah, which has only 30 <i>pesukim</i>. During
those years that Yom Kippur coincides with Shabbos, we read <i>Parshas Haazinu</i>
on <i>Shabbos</i> <i>Shuva</i>, the third shortest <i>parsha</i> in the Torah, which
consists of only 52 <i>pesukim</i>. However, during the years that <i>Parshas
Haazinu</i> is read on Shabbos <i>Shuva</i>, <i>Parshas Vayeilech</i> is read
the preceding Shabbos together with <i>Parshas Nitzavim</i> which together
total 70 <i>pesukim</i>. On Shabbos <i>Shuva</i>, not only is the <i>keriyas
haTorah</i> remarkably short, but the <i>Haftorah</i> is also taken from the
books of <i>Trei Asar</i>, the Twelve Prophets, which is a collection of the shortest
books in all of <i>Tanach</i> (see <i>Bava Basra</i> 14b).</p>

<P> On Shabbos <i>Shuva</i>, during the <i>Aseres Yemei
Teshuvah</i>, when we are standing in judgement before the Almighty, and one <i>mitzvah</i>
has the potential to alter our verdict for the coming year, why don't we
choose to read a Torah portion that is little bit more ambitious and impressive
in order to demonstrate our dedication to the <i>mitzvos</i> and learning Torah?
It seems a bit odd if not ill advised to look for an easy way out during the
most sensitive time of the entire year. However, Rav Pam suggests that these
selections are deliberate, and they are instructing us that the most effective
way to undertake a process of true <i>teshuvah</i> and real change is by
choosing realistic and attainable goals. Only through reviving our commitment
and appreciation for small accomplishments and the daily <i>mitzvos</i> that perhaps
we trampled upon throughout the previous year, can we accomplish all of the great
things we hope to achieve.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: lech]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The text of the Torah provides us with a scant amount of
information regarding the background of Avraham <i>Avinu</i>, and no indication
whatsoever regarding the nature of his previous activities or accomplishments.
We are formally introduced to Avraham somewhat abruptly, as he is taking leave
of his ancestral birthplace and embarking upon a pilgrimage to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.
It is only in the Medrash where we discover that Avraham independently deduced
the existence of a Creator, and that he courageously promoted his monotheistic
convictions to an unreceptive pagan family and society. In fact, the episode
which occurred at Ur Kasdim, wherein Avraham was miraculously rescued from the
clutches of a fiery furnace, is not mentioned at all in the <i>pesukim</i> of
the Torah. Additionally, the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Avodah Zara</i> 14b) attests
that Avraham elucidated four hundred chapters of original <i>halachic</i> rulings
in the area of <i>avodah</i> <i>zara</i>, none of which are recorded anywhere
for posterity or future study. The Ramban and many other <i>meforshim</i>
wonder, why would the Torah omit these impressive events which are not only
critical to the narrative of Avraham but also justify why he alone was chosen
to be the cornerstone of the Jewish people?</p>

<P>Rav Moshe Shapiro (<i>Mimamakim</i>) answers that while
Avraham <i>Avinu's</i> bRave brand of belief in the existence of Hashem
was undoubtably noteworthy, <i>emunah</i> comes in varying degrees and depths.
The Maharal (<i>Gevuros Hashem</i> ch. 7) explains that a theoretical belief in
the existence of Hashem is merely the preamble to a religious existence. Mature
and complete <i>emunah</i> requires a person to also be able to implement their
belief in Hashem as a guiding force in their lives, even when confronted with evidence
to the contrary. Therefore, the Torah commences the story of Avraham not by
describing the profundity of his innovative theological breakthroughs or even
with his willingness to sacrifice himself while defending the tenets of his
faith, but rather with the transitional moment when his <i>emunah</i> began to
dictate his actions even in the face of adversity. The true triumph of
tRaveling to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was not in overcoming the inconvenience of
the initial upheaval, but in Avraham's unwavering commitment to his
divine mission even while being temporarily forced to flee as a result of the
ensuing famine. Avraham only became the father of the Jewish people because his
<i>emunah</i> in Hashem brought him to continue to invest in the promise of an
enduring spiritual legacy despite the fact that he was aging and childless. Therefore,
it is with these feats, and not the adventures of his past, that the Biblical
narrative of Avraham's life begins.</p>

<P>For this reason, only after enduring the first round of
challenges and tests is Avraham regarded as a "believer", when the <i>pasuk</i>
states, "and he believed in Hashem and He considered it as charity"
(<i>Breishis</i> 15:6). Why does Avraham only merit to be recognized as a
believer at this relatively late stage of his life? How can the Torah discount
the decades he spent developing and defending the articles of his faith? The <i>Bnei</i>
<i>Yissaschar</i> (<i>Sivan</i> 5) explains that Avraham's <i>emunah</i> fully
blossomed for the first time when he refrained from doubting the wisdom and
legitimacy of Hashem's instructions despite the hardships and setbacks he
had to endure. Only when he remained determined in the face of resistance did the
reality of his transcendent <i>emunah</i> become tangible. This clarifies the
comparison between Avraham's <i>emunah</i> and the institution of
charity. Ostensibly, the requirement to give charity results in a fiscal loss
for the benefactor; after all, money is being transferred out of his account
and deposited into the account of another. However, from the perspective of a <i>maamin</i>,
who trusts in Hashem's promise to reimburse and reward all those who distribute
their resources to the needy, <i>tzedakah</i> is an investment which pays handsome
dividends. Therefore, every sincere and enthusiastic act of <i>tzedakah</i> is
likely the manifestation of a deeply held <i>emunah</i>.</p>

<P>According to the Rambam (<i>Sefer</i> <i>Hamitzvos</i> 1),
belief in Hashem is a positive commandment and the first <i>mitzvah</i>. Other <i>rishonim</i>
do not consider <i>emunah</i> to be a <i>mitzvah</i> at all since the entire
notion of a <i>mitzvah</i> presupposes a basic belief in Hashem. Indeed, without
some measure of <i>emunah</i> the very concept of <i>mitzvos</i> cannot
possibly exist, for how can we speak of a commandment without a commander. Since
this argument is so overwhelmingly compelling, many <i>meforshim</i> suggest that
the Rambam would have to cede this point as well. The Rambam only asserts that
the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>emunah</i> demands more than just a rudimentary belief
in the existence of Hashem, it requires us to act in accordance with that belief
and to remain steadfast despite the difficulties we might encounter along the
way. In other words, to fulfill the first <i>mitzvah</i>, <i>emunah</i> must be
practiced not just preached.</p>

<P>This is supported by the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Makkos</i> 24a)
which recounts that Habakkuk distilled the entire system of <i>mitzvos</i> to
one central theme, which is encapsulated by the <i>pasuk</i> "<i>ve'tzaddik
be'emunaso yichyeh</i> - the <i>tzaddik</i> lives with his faith" (<i>Habakkuk</i>
2:4). The <i>Ben</i> <i>Yehoyada</i> notes that the <i>gematriah</i> of the
word <i>emunah</i> is 102 while the numerical value of the word <i>tzaddik</i>
is 204, because every <i>tzaddik</i> (204) must have two (2) dimensions to
their <i>emunah</i> (2*102). There must be a theological belief in the
existence of Hashem, but also a determination to put that <i>emunah</i> into
practice. It is the relationship between these two facets of <i>emunah</i> which
serves as the framework for the rest of religious life.</p>

<p>The Mishnah (<i>Avos</i> 5:19) identifies the disciples of Avraham as
those who possess a good eye, a humble spirit, and a controlled personality. At
first glance this is surprising, since the defining quality of Avraham was
certainly his unshakable <i>emunah</i>. How can the emergence of <i>emunah</i>
be completely absent in any reflection on Avraham <i>Avinu's</i>
contributions? Rav Eliezer Geldzahler (<i>Sichos</i> <i>Eliezer</i>) suggests that
intellectual <i>emunah</i> alone is not enough. <i>Emunah</i> is only meaningful
when it is translated into action and ultimately produces a person who has a good
eye, a humble spirit, and a controlled personality. Therefore, as we read about
Avraham's historic accomplishments, we should be inspired to not only reinforce
the theological foundations of our own faith, but to also concentrate on living
constantly with that <i>emunah</i> and allowing it to become the guiding force
in all that we do. Only if we are successful in this challenge may we proudly
renew our claim to be the faithful students and spiritual heirs of Avraham <i>Avinu</i>.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Verbal Abuse]]></title>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: mishpatim]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The Torah stresses the importance of treating the most vulnerable members of society in an
exceedingly gentle and sensitive fashion, as the <i>pasuk</i> states,
"You shall not wrong (<i>lo</i> <i>tonu</i>) the convert etc. You shall
not mistreat any orphan or widow" (<i>Shemos</i> 22, 20-21). However, in
fact this prohibition applies not only to converts, orphans, and widows, but extends to other people within the community as well, as
we are told, "And do not wrong (<i>v'lo tonu</i>) one
another" (<i>Vayikra</i> 25, 17). The Gemara (<i>Bava Metziah</i> 58b) posits
that since a general prohibition against cheating others is already recorded in
the earlier <i>pasuk</i>, "you shall not wrong (<i>al</i> <i>tonu</i>)
one another" (<i>Vayikra</i> 25, 14), this latter prohibition must be
directed towards additional forms of mistreatment, specifically hurtful speech
or even verbal abuse, known as <i>onaas</i> <i>devarim</i>.</p>

<P>Rav Avraham Pam once observed, "Over the past few years, so much has been
written and said concerning the sin of speaking <i>lashon</i> <i>hara</i> etc.
However, there is another sin relating to speech about which very little is
spoken, and that is <i>onaas</i> <i>devarim</i>." Rav Pam continued and
reflected upon the irony of this phenomenon. <i>Lashon</i> <i>hara</i> is evil speech
which is perpetrated about someone else, usually in their absence. However, the
prohibition of <i>onaas devarim</i> relates to hurtful and even abusive remarks
that are made directly to the victim, in their presence, which can obviously be
all the more offensive and traumatic, and therefore arguably deserves greater
attention and vigilance. Indeed, we find certain instances in halacha where a
verbal assault is treated more severely than a physical attack, which of course
is also a heinous crime.</p>

<P>For example, while it is well established, that a doctor can cause a wound for a medical or
rehabilitative purpose, cruel and insulting comments are prohibited even when
one has the best of intentions. The Gemara (<i>Bava</i> <i>Basra</i> 16a) attests
that Peninah taunted Chanah (<i>Shmuel</i> 1, 1) about her childlessness only in
order to encourage her to <i>daven</i> with greater intensity. Nonetheless,
despite her noble objective, the pain Peninah caused Chanah with her words was intolerable,
and she was ultimately punished bitterly as a result. The Vilna Gaon suggests
that this lesson is alluded to in the language of the ensuing <i>pasuk</i>,
"If you dare cause him pain, <u>so that he shall cry out</u> to Me, I
shall surely hear his cry" (<i>Shemos</i> 22, 22). Even if one only
caused grief to the orphan or the widow, for their own benefit, "<u>so
that he shall cry out</u>" to Hashem with greater devotion, it is still
forbidden.</p>

<P>Similarly, the <i>Baal Haturim</i> (<i>Breishis</i> 21, 10) claims that the Jewish people
were exiled specifically to the land of Egypt as result of the unforgiving
manner in which Sarah unceremoniously evicted Hagar the Egyptian from her home,
as the <i>pasuk</i> states, "She said to Avraham, 'Cast out that
slave-woman and her son.'" Rav Shlomo Kluger alleges that the familiar
statement of the Pesach Haggadah, "And he went down to Egypt forced by
the <u>word</u>," does not refer to the "word" of Hashem, but
rather to Sarah's callous words towards Hagar. Even though Sarah acted
aggressively for the sole purpose of preserving the spiritual integrity of
Yitzchok, her descendants were punished for her abrasive tone. Rav Chaim
Shmuelevitz (<i>Sichos Mussar</i>) compares a person who speaks harshly to
others to one who ventures into an ominous blaze. No matter how virtuous their
intentions, they will inevitably become burned.</p>

<P>In addition, the Ramban (<i>Shemos</i> 21, 15) notes that the method of capital punishment
administered for cursing a parent is more stringent than the death penalty
which accompanies striking a parent. Rav Eliyahu Baruch Finkel proposes that
this reflects the reality that often the emotional wounds of betrayal and isolation
created by the denunciations and condemnations of one's own child, can be
more profound and painful than a physical bruise or gash. The Maharal (<i>Nesivos</i>
<i>Olam</i>) explains more deeply, that verbal assaults can be so pernicious
and poignant because they are not targeted at the external body which is naturally
trained to heal over time, but rather with intent to harm the soul of a person,
to diminish their self-worth, significance, and contribution. For this reason,
the recovery process from the emotional wounds of hurtful comments can be complex
and prolonged, and can never be confined to a financial settlement or mitigated
by monetary compensation.</p>

<p>One of the subtler differences between the two competing versions of musical notes (<i>trop</i>) that accompany
the ten commandments, known as the <i>taam</i> <i>tachton</i> and the <i>taam</i>
<i>elyon</i>, is that in the <i>taam</i> <i>tachton</i> there is a <i>pasach</i>
underneath the letter <i>tzadi</i> in the word "<i>lo</i> <i>tirtzach</i>"
- "do not murder", while in the <i>taam</i> <i>elyon</i> there is a
<i>komatz</i>. The word "<i>pasach"</i> is related to the word
"<i>lifsoach</i>" - "to open," and the word <i>komatz</i>
is associated with "<i>likmotz</i>" - "to close." The
Chasam Sofer suggests that this teaches us that in order to avoid verbal murder,
and to preserve the dignity and wellbeing of others, we need to be able to
close our mouths and refrain from speaking harshly and in a hurtful manner
towards others. At the same time, when we witness verbal abuse, we must summon
the courage and strength to open our mouths, to protest, protect, and defend
the lives and self-esteem of the innocent and all those who need our help.</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: shlach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>At the beginning of <i>Parshas Shelach</i> the Torah lists
the names of the <i>meraglim</i> who descended to tour and survey <i>Eretz
Yisrael</i>. "These are their names: For the tribe of Reuven, Shamua the son of
Zakur. For the tribe of Shimon, Shaphat the son of Chori. For the tribe of Yehudah,
Calev the son of Yephuneh. For the tribe of Yissachar, Yigal the son of Yoseph.
For the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun etc." (<i>Bamidbar</i> 13:4-8).
The first four tribes that are mentioned, Reuven, Shimon, Yehudah, and
Yissachar follow the chronological order of their birth, however, the fifth,
Ephraim, breaks the pattern which is not restored subsequently. This
inconsistency prompts the Seforno to suggest that the Torah in fact listed the <i>mergalim</i>
according to their own age and not according to the chronological birth of their
respective <i>shevatim</i>. The Ramban disagrees and argues that the <i>meraglim</i>
were not actually recorded according to their age at all but rather according
to their degree of wisdom.</p>

<P>However, Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky (<i>Emes Le'Yaakov</i>)
suggests that while the list was initially arranged chronologically, the order
in which the latter eight <i>shevatim</i> and <i>meraglim</i> are mentioned is entirely
haphazard without any compelling rhyme or reason. Rav Yaakov claims that
historically, the <i>meraglim</i> approached Moshe chronologically in order to
volunteer, however this systematic procession quickly became chaotic when the
representative from Ephraim, Hoshea <i>bin</i> Nun, asserted himself ahead of
his rightful spot in line. This is supported by the <i>pasuk</i> which states
in connection with the <i>meraglim</i>, "And <u>all</u> of you approached me
and said, 'Let us send men ahead of us'" (<i>Devarim</i> 1:22). <i>Rashi</i>
explains that the <i>meraglim</i> pounced on Moshe all at once, in a
disorganized frenzy, where those who were younger were pushing ahead of those
who were older. For this reason, Moshe davened solely for the welfare of Hoshea
by adding the letter <i>yud</i> to his name, since he alone had demonstrated a somewhat
volatile disposition which had sparked the pandemonium.</p>

<P>Rav Meir Tzvi Bergman (<i>Shaarei</i> <i>Orah</i>) suggests
that a critical component of the tragedy of the <i>meraglim</i> can be
attributed to their eventual lack of order and organization. When things are
cluttered, out of place, and in disarray, it prevents us from properly
organizing our thoughts and priorities, and ultimately obstructs our ability to
make thoughtful decisions and good choices. Sanctity and spirituality can only
exist within the confines of a stable and systematically structured environment.
The Alter from Kelm once tRaveled to visit his son while he was away at
yeshiva. When the Alter arrived, he was unable to immediately locate his son in
his dormitory, but when he saw that his bed was crisply set, his clothes
creased and folded, and his closet neatly arranged, the Alter concluded that
his son must be learning studiously and succeeding since orderliness is the
hallmark of productivity and holiness.</p>

<P>The establishment of order and organization might even be
one of the reasons Hashem created the world in the first place. The Gemara (<i>Megillah</i>
15b) states, "whoever attributes a statement to its originator has brought
redemption to the world." While honesty in assigning credit is certainly
praiseworthy, in what sense does this bring redemption to the world? The Maharal
(<i>Derech</i> <i>Chaim</i>) explains that initially the world was in a state
of muddled confusion, as the <i>pasuk</i> states, "<i>v'ha'aretz haysa tohu</i>
<i>vavohu</i> - the land was in a state of chaos" (<i>Breishis</i> 1:2). It was
precisely the process of creation that introduced order to the world by
separating between light and darkness, the skies and the earth, the water and
the dry land, and the day and the night. In the age of the internet, we can
certainly appreciate the pernicious effects of obscurity and anonymity when
issuing statements and offering opinions, and the vital need for accountability
and responsibility. Therefore, citing sources and ascribing credit restores
some semblance of order to the world, and in turn justifies and redeems the
purpose for which the world was created.</p>

<P>At the beginning of <i>Sefer Bamidbar</i> the Torah spends
an inordinate amount of time detailing the flags, formations, and the manner in
which the Jewish people encamped and tRaveled around the <i>Mishkan</i> in the
desert. Similarly, all of the procedures and protocols of the <i>Mishkan</i>
itself, while stationary and in transit, were highly regimented and precisely
delegated. The <i>Maor Vashemesh</i>, and later Rav Aharon Kotler (<i>Mishnas
Rebbi Ahron</i>) suggest that the Torah is stressing that organization and
order are indispensable prerequisites for achieving sanctity and cultivating a
religiously inspired and productive atmosphere. In fact, the word "<i>seder</i>
- order" is the root of the word "<i>siddur</i>" which we use to <i>daven</i>,
because without <i>seder</i> it is impossible to connect with Hashem through <i>tefillah</i>.</p>

<P>Additionally, the night of Pesach, which is saturated with a
multitude of <i>mitzvos</i>, revolves around "The <i>Seder</i> - The Order."
Ostensibly, this is an unusual way of referring to a night which is punctuated
by eating <i>matzah</i> and <i>marror</i>, drinking wine, and retelling the
story of our exodus from Egypt. However, perhaps this is another indication and
reminder that only through the organized medium of the <i>seder</i>, which is
an orchestrated and coordinated effort of transmission from one generation to
the next, can we deepen our relationship with Hashem. During the summer many of
us will depart from our usual routine and schedule, but we should not allow
this to create a disorderly and disorganized culture as it relates to our
davening, learning, and performing <i>mitzvos</i>. We must do our best to
maintain our flags and formation, and preserve as much as possible our regular
sense of <i>seder</i>, which is so critical to our religious growth.</p>

<P>This <i>parsha</i> has the unique distinction of being the organic beginning of the Torah. Rashi,
in the famous opening lines to his <i>peirush</i> on <i>Chumash</i>, quotes the
<i>midrash</i> which asks,</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>"shouldn't the Torah have started with the
portion of '<i>hachodesh hazeh lochem</i>', which is the first <i>mitzvah</i>
that Israel was commanded? Why does the <i>Chumash</i> start with <i>Bereishis</i>?
[The answer is] ...so that if the nations of the world will accuse Israel
of being thieves by dint of having conquered the Land [of Israel] from the
seven nations, they will reply that the entire world is G-d's; He created
it and gave it to whom was fit in His eyes. He gave it to them by dint of His
will, and by dint of His will took it from them and gave it to us."</p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This Rashi
certainly can't mean that this will convince the nations of the world of
anything. It hasn't for the last millennia, and by all accounts does not
seem to be doing so now. Additionally, starting the Torah with <i>hachodesh
hazeh lachem</i> seems odd. If we are meant to start the Torah with the world
of <i>mitzvos</i>, then surely it is <i>mattan Torah</i> that we should start
with. The Rambam (<i>Peirush Hamishnayos</i>) famously states that the validity
of any <i>mitzvah</i> starts with the Sinaitic revelation. Any <i>mitzvah</i>
given before [i.e. <i>millah</i> or <i>gid hanasha</i>] is still in effect only
because it was repeated at Sinai. Why, then, would it be proper to start the
Torah at our <i>parsha</i>?</p>

<P>To understand
the fundamental difference between <i>Bereishis</i> and "<i>hachodesh
hazeh lochem</i>", we will need to examine to fundamental contexts of
"universe": natural/determined, versus "willed"/ choice.
On the one hand we can posit that the most basic structure of our universe is
"law and order", which fits so well with our experience of the
immutable natural laws. In this context Hashem appeared and commanded
particular deeds to be performed, and prohibited particular activities.</p>

<P>On the other
hand, one may posit a supernatural context, wherein everything is the
"will of G-d" and the natural order as such is but a temporary
- albeit long-lived - particular "will of Hashem".</p>

<P>If we are to
ask what is the most basic unit of our universe, we may well answer: time. It
is the most unbending and unyielding of the four dimensions [Einstein aside.]</p>

<P>Thus <i>Bereishis</i>
begins with time: In the beginning. The core <s>unto</s> of time is a day.
There was night and daytime, forming "one day." This is the natural
world, and time is immutable. "What was before" is irrelevant, and
from the point of <i>Bereishis</i> on, day is a fixed unit of time. The holy
day which comes out of this arrangement is Shabbos, which is characterized as
"<i>k'vi'ih v'kaymi</i> - fixed and
immutable."</p>

<P>But there is
another unit of time called <i>chodesh</i>. This is an inherently fluctuating
unit, as it has no direct correlation with "days"; any given month
can be longer or shorter. But more importantly, its <i>halachic</i> status is
given to change. The length of the month and its position in the year are set
by humans. Humans act not only as observers of the passage of months, but we
actually can add or subtract a month, as per our need.</p>

<P>Thus in the
first model, time is fixed and man is the variable; in the second model man is
fixed, i.e. <i>atem</i>, and time is variable.</p>

<P>The nations
of the world have seven <i>mitzvos</i>, corresponding to the seven days of
creation. Their world's framing context is a fixed natural order <u>within</u>
which G-d is omnipotent. The additional <i>miztvos</i> that we have are not
simply more of the same, but rather are a function of a different contextualization
of our existence. <i>Chazal</i> teach us that the six hundred and thirteen <i>miztvos</i>
represent the elements of the human body. It is the Torah of man, rather than
the Torah of the world.</p>

<P>It would
therefore not be adequate to begin the Torah at <i>mattan Torah</i>. We must
start with redefining the universe itself, such that man is the at the core and
is the central point of reference of existence, and time is his obedient
servant. The corresponding alternative to <i>Bereishis</i> is<i> hachodesh
hazeh lochem</i>, not the <i>Aseres Hadibros</i>. And, indeed, the
Torah's real Genesis is <i>hachodesh hazeh</i>.</p>

<P>Hashem did
not want to leave creation distributed between two frameworks, one centered on
temporality and one anthropocentric, which did not interface with each other.
Such a bifurcation would run counter to Hashem's unity. Translating this
to the world of ethics, this would mean that a system in the universe in which
Hashem was ethical according to a Torah viewpoint but seemingly unjust from the
perspective of a [Divinely imbued] universal morality is unacceptable. Rather,
Hashem engineered a universe in which the various articulations of His will all
point in the same direction, and according to which <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> is
understandably and justly ours from both perspectives - the perspective
of <i>hachodesh</i> and the perspective of <i>Bereishis</i>.</p>

<P>The
remarkable unity between the framework centered on time and the anthropocentric
framework was not put into place to convince the nations of the world of the
validity of our claim to <i>Eretz Yisroel</i>. Rather it was created to teach <u>us</u>
that Torah is true both from our particularistic morality and according to its
reflection in universal morality as well.</p>

		<author><![CDATA[Rav Aaron Lopiansky]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2019]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: emor]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P><i>Prashas Emor</i> starts with the special laws that apply
to <i>kohanim</i>. Because <i>kohanim</i> are expected to be on a higher
spiritual level then everyone else, the Torah requires more of them. One such
requirement is that they stay away from corpses. The <i>Rishonim</i> try to
give us some sense, in a way that we can relate to, of what "defilement"
occurs by being in proximity to a dead body.</p>

<P>Be that as it may, an exception is made for the <i>kohen</i>
when the deceased is one of the seven close relatives recognized by <i>halacha</i>.
The <i>Sefer Hachinuch</i> (<i>mitzvah</i> 263) explains that the ways of Torah
are pleasant (i.e. compatible with human nature) and the Torah did not want to
distress the <i>kohanim</i>, for it is a great relief to pour out one's
emotion and "gain solace through tears."</p>

<P>And yet, the Torah prohibits a <i>Kohen
Gadol</i> from becoming <i>tameh</i> even for one of his seven close relatives.
The <i>Sefer Hachinuch</i> (<i>mitzvah</i> 270) explains this difference by
saying, "because the [<i>Kohen Gadol</i>]'s soul is bound up with
Hashem, totally separated from human nature, and has all but forgotten this
physical world, he therefore does not truly mourn his close ones, for even
while they are alive, he is already distant from them."</p>

<P>This same distinction between
"man" and "superman" is actually the crux of the <i>parsha</i>
of Aharon and Miriam's <i>lashon hara</i> about Moshe (Bamidbar 12:1-2).
They questioned the appropriateness of his having separated from his wife
because of his being a prophet. They pointed out that they, too, were prophets
and yet were expected to continue to live normal family lives. Hashem responded
to them that Moshe was different. The Rambam (<i>Hilchos Yesodei haTorah</i>
7:7) articulates this difference as Moshe, "having bound himself to the <i>Tzur
haolamim</i> [i.e. hashem], never leaving that <i>dveikus</i>."</p>

<P>This concept expresses itself in many
aspects of Torah, from the Ramban's stating (<i>Vayikra</i> 26:11) that,
"doctors have no place in the house of G-d" to Rav Chanina <i>ben</i>
Dosa's reliance on miracles (<i>Berachos</i> 33, 34, and many more.) It
is not that there are two Torahs, <i>chas v'shalom</i>; rather there is
the Torah for people whose reality is a physical world with the awareness that
Hashem is behind it all, and a different set of norms for those who perceive
that Hashem <u>is</u> the reality.</p>

<P>The Chazon Ish hints at this at
the end of chapter two of <i>Emunah V'Bitachon</i>. Throughout the
chapter the Chazon Ish stresses that genuine <i>bitachon</i> requires engaging
with the world and believing that Hashem is doing what is best regardless of
whether things turn out the way we would like them to. And yet, he hints at the
end of that chapter, that a person who is on an extraordinary level of <i>bitachon</i>
can actually sense the concurrent <i>hasgacha</i> and be aware that everything <u>will</u>
be well.</p>

<P>I think that this principle is an
important one to explain to our children when telling stories of great people
that describe deeds that are commensurate only with a very high <i>madreiga</i>.
For instance, there is a well-known story of the Vilna Gaon only greeting his
sister for a very short time after not seeing her for many years and then
immediately returning to his learning. When sharing that story, one must
emphasize that for us this would be ignoble behavior, and only on the
extraordinarily high <i>madreiga</i> of the Vilna Gaon who, like the <i>Kohen
gadol</i>, lived on an entirely different plane and was barely connected to
this world, is such behavior appropriate. It is not that there are different
rules for different people, per se. Rather, there are different rules for
different circumstances. Loss of kin is a genuine tragedy for humans living in
the world that the vast majority of us live in. But for those humans leaving in
a higher world than ours, death is merely the transition to the next phase of
life.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[<i>Kanous</i>: Anarchy or Ultimate Justice?]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Aaron Lopiansky]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2019]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: pinchas]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>This <i>parsha</i> start by lauding
Pinchas for his courageous act of <i>kanous</i> - zealousness. <i>Bnai Yisroel</i>
are saved because of his act and he himself is granted eternal priesthood and
an eternal covenant with Hashem. This would definitely indicate that what he
had done was most worthy.</p>

<P>Yet when we take a closer look at
the associated <i>halachos</i>, we are perplexed. For instance, the <i>halachah</i>
is that if a <i>kanoi</i> first asks <i>beis din </i>what to do, he is never
granted permission to act as Pinchas did (Rambam <i>Hilchos Isurei Biah</i>,
12:4). Additionally, the <i>kanoi</i> can only kill the transgressors while
they are engaged in the sinful act. If he does so a moment later, he is judged
as a murderer and punished. Even more vexing is the ruling (<i>Sanhedrin</i>
81b) that had Zimri turned around and killed Pinchas in self-defense, he would
have been within in his rights, and therefore innocent of murder! This all
leaves us to wonder: was Pinchas's act laudatory or murder; was Pinchas right
or wrong?</p>

<P>The Talmud Yerushalmi (<i>Sanhedrin</i>
48b) goes a step further and states that this type of action is and was
diapproved by the <i>Chachomim</i>, and they actually wished to put him into <i>cherem</i>.
The only reason they did not do so was because the Divine Spirit declared that
a covenant was being forged with Pinchas on account of this act! But how does
this square with the dictum, "<i>lo baShomayim he</i>", that the <i>chachomim</i>,
and not new information emanating from Heaven, have the final say in
determining the <i>halacha</i>? And if, on the other hand, the Divine Spirit
does have the final say, then why do the <i>chachomim</i> still disapprove of <i>kanoim</i>?</p>

<P>The topic of <i>kanous</i> also
raises troubling questions about a society that allows itself to be run by
extra-judicial actions and vigilantes. Is this not anarchy?</p>

<P>The Akeidah (Sha'ar 83) give us
tremendous insight into this <i>parsha</i> and I will try to rephrase his
lengthy and somewhat hidden words. </p>

<P>The world of <i>miztvos</i> is
aimed at one's rational faculties. The <i>mitzvos</i> of punishing sinners
comprise a mandate imposed on the courts of <i>Klal Yisroel</i>. Concomitantly,
those sins that are beyond the pale of human judgement, are only for G-d to
judge and punish as He sees fit. </p>

<P>A person, however, possesses a
spirit, that rises above his intellect. If a man is so moved by righteousness
that he abandons logic and is willing to sacrifice himself [e.g. Pinchas
exposing himself to the possibility of Zimri killing him in self-defense], it
is his spirit rising to the occaision. His soul, thereby becomes an emissary
for the Divine <i>Beis Din</i>, so to speak, and he is now acting as an agent
of the Divine Court, not as an agent of a human <i>beis din</i>.</p>

<P>An analogous situation would be
where one sees an innocent person being murdered. Assuming the witness has no
chance of rescuing the victim, reason dictates that he protect his own life by
not intervening. But if this witness has such a strong sense of moral outrage
that he nonetheless stands up and fights the attacker - even if it was to no
avail, and makes "no sense" -  we would commend his noble spirit of
righteousness, that could not sit idly by and tolerate the injustice that was
being perpetrated. Thus <i>kanous</i> is not, and can't be, mandated. It must
be the spontaneous reaction of a noble spirit who can't tolerate evil, no
matter what the consequences.</p>

<P>Rav Moshe Chaim Luzzato (<i>Mesilas Yesharim</i>, chapter 19) phrases it thus:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>It is obvious that
a person who truly loves his friend will not be able to tolerate someone
hitting him or humiliating him, and will surely defend him. Similarly, one who
loves Hashem's Name will not be able to see its desecration by a wanton
disregard for transgressions.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This <i>kanous</i> is, on the one
hand, an expression of the ultimate nobility of the human spirit. But on the
other hand, it is greatly suspect. It requires an extraordinary purity of
motive and precision of timing.</p>

<P>The Netziv (<i>Ha'amek Davar</i>, <i>Breishis</i>
34:25) expresses this most precisely when describing Shimon and Levi's killing
of Shechem:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Though the two brothers were united in their great fury, and personal endangerment, their
motives were extremely different. One was merely expressing the human response
to an insult to family pride, and that is an "alien fire" [i.e. an improper and
un-Jewish motive.] The other was coming with a zealousness for G-d's justice
without personal interest or gain. But even that motive needs to be applied at
the right time and place, for if not, it too can be very destructive.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Yes, the Ravs condemn
zealousness, for it is a non-halachic response, done out of motives that are
suspect. But when the Divine Spirit revealed to us that Pinchas was the unique
individual whose actions stemmed from the noblest of spirits and purest of
motives, expressed at the right time and place, then we rightfully hail him as
the savior of Israel!</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>"And [Moshe] said to them 'I am a hundred and twenty years today, I can no longer go
forth or come in..." (<i>Devarim</i> 31:2)</p>

<P>The <i>Gemara</i>,
focusing on the word "today", explains this <i>possuk</i> as
indicating that Moshe had turned one hundred and twenty on the very day of his
death; his birthday and day of departure were the same. This, the <i>Gemara</i> indicates,
is the mark of the death of righteous people, as Hashem, "completes their
lives from day to day and month to month." It is unclear what exactly is
the significance of this. Given a choice of living a long life without
"rounding out" the days, or living a shorter life with the days and
months "rounded out", would one not rather have the longer life?</p>

<P>The Maharal (<i>Chiddushei
Aggados</i>, <i>Sotah</i> 13b) associates another <i>Chazal</i> with
this point. He points to a <i>midrash</i> about Sara's life, and uses
the verse, "Hashem takes note of the lives of <i>temimim</i> (righteous,
literally - complete)"; just as they are "complete" so too are
their years "completed". Although it is not clear from the <i>midrash</i> what
exactly is referred to by this "completeness", the Maharal compares
it to our <i>Gemara</i>, indicating that the point of our <i>Gemara</i> is
to delineate the <i>temimus</i> quality of <i>tzaddikim</i>.</p>

<P>But what
exactly does this "completeness" mean? It is unreasonable to say that
this refers to "complete in the sense of "perfect", for we know
the dictum that, "there is no <i>tsaddik</i> in this world who
never sins" (<i>Koheles</i> 7:20). So what particular quality of the
righteous are we referring to with the metaphor of "complete"?</p>

<P>Indeed, the
quality of <i>temimus</i> is not a measure of total righteousness,
but rather a perspective on man's mission. One can look at the world simply as
a place with many opportunities for <i>mitzvos,</i> which in turn add
up to many wonderful rewards. In that perspective man has no particular mission
and no all-encompassing accomplishment, but rather <i>mitzvah</i> by <i>mitzvah</i> we
attain more and more reward. This frames the world as a sort of carnival where
you can earn reward cards through various activities, and more cards you
collect the greater your prize.</p>

<P>But there is a
much deeper perspective on life. A person's life is a discrete unit of <i>avodas</i> Hashem,
and there is a specific mission to be carried out. The subdivisions of time,
i.e. years, months, and days, are meaningful subdivisions, each one in turn
containing a discrete subdivision of that big picture. Thus, a complete month
is a complete unit of <i>avodas</i> Hashem which, together with the
other months, forms a complete year. The same is true of days adding up to a
month.</p>

<P>A true <i>tzaddik</i> is
someone who has this deeper perspective on life. He is not busy
collecting <i>mitzvos</i>, but rather fulfilling a clear and distinct
mission. An incomplete month, or a partial year, is a total failure<b> </b>from
a <i>tzaddik's</i> perspective; one has done good things but has not
really "accomplished" anything. Thus, Hashem's reward for the <i>tsaddik</i> is
to have his life come to fulfillment - full years, full days.</p>

<P>Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i> emphasizes
this point with the continuation of his statement, "I can no longer go
forth or come in." Rashi explains that this can't be referring to physical
infirmity, for the <i>passuk</i> emphasizes his total health. Rather,
Rashi says, his "wellsprings of wisdom" had dried out.</p>

<P>This does not
mean that his mental acuity had dulled. Rather the "wellspring had dried
out". There was no longer any new wisdom coming forth from his studies.
For the true <i>tzaddik</i> who finds meaning in the unique mission
that each day and month brings, a simple repetition of "what was, will
be" is contrary to his approach to life.</p>

<P>As we begin our
new year iy"H, we must bear in mind that a new unit of time is not just a
yardstick for "how much more of the same will we have". Rather it is
a new phase of <i>avodas</i> Hashem, with a starting and ending point
at <i>Rosh Hashana</i>. Our job is to undertake the new year as a new
mission and iy"H Hashem will give us the opportunity to wholly complete
the mission of our lives, so that when we finish our mission in this world, it will
be with a sense of completeness: days, months, and years.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[<i>Korbanos</i>: Gift vs. Obligation]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Aaron Lopiansky]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2019]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vayikra]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Vayikra begins by laying down the laws of <i>korbanos</i>,
the Temple offerings or "sacrifices" as colloquially [but quite
inaccurately] translated. The second <i>passuk</i> details a few general disqualifications
that limit what animals may be used for a <i>korban</i> in all types of <i>korbanos</i>.
"<u>Of</u> the cattle" invalidates animals upon whom bestiality has
been performed, "<u>of</u> the sheep" eliminates those animals
designated for animal worship or those animals who had killed a person, and so
on. The exclusions listed are specific to <i>korbanos</i> and are derived
directly from the grammatical form employed [i.e. the word "of",
such as in "<u>of</u> the sheep", implies that some of a given set
of animals are acceptable, but not all.]</p>

<P>The very first disqualification that is learned from these <i>pesukim</i>,
however, presents two difficulties. The very first passuk says, "<u>a man</u>
who will offer up a <i>korban</i>", which is explained to teach us that,
"just as the first man [i.e. Adam] did not offer stolen animals [as <i>korbanos</i>],
for everything belonged to him, so too when you bring a <i>korban</i>, you may
not bring a stolen [animal as a] <i>korban</i>."</p>

<P>This is doubly troubling. First of all, the prohibition of
using stolen goods for the purpose of a <i>mitzvah</i> applies to all <i>mitzvos</i>
and could have been taught in the context of any <i>mitzvah</i>. Why, then,
would this universal disqualification be the first one listed for <i>korbanos</i>?
Shouldn't something uniquely relevant to <i>korbanos</i> have been listed
first? Secondly, at first glance it seems to be a stretch, contrived even, to
assume that "<i>adam</i> - a man" refers specifically to Adam <i>harishon</i>
and his ownership of all animals in the world. What does this seemingly
far-fetched allusion mean?</p>

<P>In order to understand the unique impropriety of stolen <i>korbanos</i>,
we must define the world of <i>korbanos</i> vis-a-vis all other <i>mitzvos</i>.</p>

<P>Imagine I hire a workman to fix something in my house and
then discover that he used stolen goods to do so. Although I will be very upset
and feel that he had committed a terrible wrong, his wrongdoing does not contradict
the essence of our transaction. I paid him to fix something, and he did so. But
now let us picture someone giving a close friend an expensive stolen item as a
gift, or a <i>chosson</i> giving a <i>kallah</i> a stolen diamond ring. In
these cases, the misdeed strikes at the heart of the very gift. The very
essence of a gift is giving of oneself to another, i.e. taking the time and
effort that I've invested in earning money and giving it to another in
the form of a gift. The giving of oneself is totally absent when presenting a
stolen gift, and thus such a gift has no redeeming value whatsoever.</p>

<P>The world of <i>avodas</i> Hashem has two major components:
obligations and voluntary opportunities. <i>Mitzvos</i> are, first and
foremost, commandments. A person who does a <i>mitzvah</i>, even if there are
shortcomings in its performance, still has done his duty. But then there are <i>korbanos</i>,
which are "offerings." Although some <i>korbanos</i> are
obligatory, the quintessential <i>korban</i> is a voluntary offering, the
equivalent of a "gift." This is evidenced by the fact that Rashi
explains that the very first part of Vayikra is speaking specifically about a
voluntary <i>korban</i>. This would indicate that the quintessential form of <i>korban</i>
is indeed the voluntary gift, while the obligatory <i>korbanos</i> comprise a
special subcategory. It therefore makes sense that the first disqualification
listed for <i>korbanos</i> is a stolen <i>korban</i>, for this negates the
essence of the <i>korban</i>. It is almost as if the <i>passuk</i> is meant to
read, "if man offers of <u>himself</u> a <i>korban</i>", and if
there is no "self" in the <i>korban</i> being offered, there is
absolutely no <i>korban</i> to speak of. Offering a stolen animal is not an
ancillary offense, or even the violation of a prerequisite; rather it is a
distortion of what a <i>korban</i> is supposed to be! Adam was the only person
in the world and thus its exclusive owner, and therefore his bringing a <i>korban</i>
was, by definition, giving of himself, and that serves as the prototype of what
a <i>korban</i> is supposed to be.</p>

<P>This gives us insight into why the <i>nevi'im</i>, when
castigating <i>Klal Yisroel</i> for their sins, kept harping on their <i>korbanos</i>.
For when a person is negligent in some of his duties, he is not excused from
the rest of his duties, and certainly is not to be faulted for fulfilling them!
If one does not wear <i>teffilin</i>, he will not be excoriated for wearing <i>tzitzis</i>!
But <i>korbanos</i> are "extra-credit." As such, if a person is
negligent in his basic obligations, and yet offers <i>korbanos</i>, the <i>korbanos</i>
are seen as a cynical attempt to curry favor with Hashem instead of doing what
is right. If we steal, act unjustly, and do not care for the weak, we are still
doing what is right when we blow <i>shofar</i> and eat <i>matzah</i>; the
wrongness of our misdeeds and the correctness of our <i>miztvos</i> are
independent of each other. But when we dare offer "gifts" to Hashem
while also engaging in wrongdoing, then the negative connotations of our
misdeeds corrupt the <i>korbanos</i> themselves.</p>

<P>This is something to consider when we are engaged in
activities that are <i>lifnim mishuras hadin</i>. As long as a person is
focused on doing what is required <i>min hadin</i>, then his shortcomings do
not directly affect his <i>mitzvos</i>. But if a person goes <i>lifnim mishuras
hadin</i> in some areas while being grossly negligent in others, his <i>lifnim
mishuras hadin</i> becomes a tRavesty and highlights his wrongdoings, <i>chas
v'shalom</i>.</p>

says about Yosef, "he is a first born, an ox" (<i>Devarim</i> 33);
while "a donkey" alludes to <i>moshiach ben</i> Dovid, as it says,
"a poor man riding on a donkey" (<i>Zechariah</i> 9.)</p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The Midrash also discusses the fact that these two tribes of
Yehuda and Yosef have particular references regarding their ability to vanquish
Esav.</p>

<P>The Midrash's interpretation that this <i>passuk</i>
refers to some spiritual strength implies that the issue being addressed in
the <i>passuk</i> is a spiritual struggle, i.e. Esav embodying both the force
of evil inclination leading Israel astray, and simultaneously embodying the
Satan who demands Israel's annihilation because of their misdeeds (as the
Zohar explains at great length regarding the <i>yom hadin</i>. Our <i>parsha,</i>
says the Zohar, is alluding to Esav's showing up at the <i>yom hadin</i>
and demanding that Israel be made to suffer for their sins.)</p>

<P>We therefore may understand Yaakov's boast about
Yosef. He is the "ox" which is a paradigm of strength, as Rashi
explains regarding the metaphor which compares Yosef to an ox, "he is as
powerful as an ox in conquering various kingdoms" (<i>Devarim</i> 33:17.)
</p>

<P>But what is expressed by having Yehuda compare to a donkey?
A donkey poses neither the beauty and grace of a horse nor the strength of an
ox; the donkey is a just a plodding wretched creature. The <i>passuk</i> that
the <i>midrash</i> uses about an impoverished <i>moshiach</i> riding on a
donkey, represents an Israel at its nadir. What is there to boast about?</p>

<P>The answer is that the <i>Midrash</i> is actually revealing
to us the secret of successful struggle with the forces of evil. That struggle,
in order to be truly successful, requires two different, almost opposite,
strengths. The first strength is the courage to proactively fight that which is
bad, as <i>Chazal</i> tell us, "Raish Lakish said, 'a person should
always use his good inclination to confront his evil inclination'"
(<i>Berachos</i> 5a.) This requires strength and courage, best represented in
the form of an "ox" proactively charging ahead with his powerful
body pushing hard. A person should not spend his life guarding himself from the
more base elements of his nature; rather he should proactively keep changing
and developing his character.</p>

<P>But that alone is not enough, for no matter how hard a
person tries, he will inevitably fall at various times. And each fall adds more
and more "baggage", mental and emotional. He will have to struggle
with the weight of his misdeeds that are dragging him down. It is human nature
that even if a person fights energetically when winning; if he begins to suffer
defeat, he becomes demoralized and loses his will to continue fighting or even
going on at all. This is where the strength of the donkey comes into play. It
is not the charging strength of an ox, rather it is the strength to bear burden
on top of burden and still continue onwards.</p>

<P><i>Moshiach</i> will eventually come riding on a donkey, for
the final redeemer will be the one who can take a nation, perhaps overwhelmed
by its wrongdoings over the millennia, and have it keep plodding on. The donkey
may seem slow and ungainly, but it will continue onwards and eventually cross
the finish line.</p>

<P>Yes, it is only when Yaakov had begotten the powerful
charging strength embodied in Yosef <i>Hatzaddik,</i> <b>along</b> with the
strength of bearing that Yehuda, the quintessential <i>ba'al</i> <i>teshuva</i>,
brought to <i>Klal Yisroel</i>, was Yaakov assured that he will someday triumph
over Esav.</p>

<p>With the taste of <i>matzah</i> still in our mouths, I'd like to share with you an exciting teaching of the
Vilna Gaon which appears in <i>Aderes Eliyahu</i> on <i>parshas Acharei Mos</i>.
In <i>Vayikra</i> (18:5) we are taught, "you shall observe My decrees and
My laws, which man shall carry out and by which he shall live (<i>v'chai bahem</i>)
- I am Hashem." Interestingly, Rashi and <i>Targum</i> Unkelus understand the
words <i>v'chai bahem</i> as referring to the world to come; the Torah is
assuring and promising reward in the next world.</p>

<P>The Talmud (<i>Yuma</i> 85b), in providing sources for the
law that saving a life overrides the Shabbos, teaches that Shmuel used the
verse "<i>v'chai bahem</i>" as the primary source that <i>mitzvos</i>
are to be lived, and except for the three cardinal sins of idolatry, adultery
and murder, all laws of the Torah are suspended to save life. In keeping with
this understanding that the verse is referring to life in this world, the Vilna Gaon teaches that <i>mitzvos</i>
are the source of life for the Jew. The Zohar (<i>Parshas Tetzaveh</i> 183b)
calls <i>matzah</i>, "<i>michla d'asvasa</i> - bread of elixir" and
"<i>michla d'm'hemnusa</i> - bread of faith." I believe the above
may be taken literally, that in addition to the flour and water, one of the
benefits of ingesting <i>matzah</i> is Vitamin F - faith. It helps the Jew
believe, and when crises occur throughout the year, the injection of Vitamin F
assists in responding with faith. Similarly, the Vilna Gaon teaches us that inherent in all <i>mitzvos</i>
is a spiritual reservoir that enriches the soul. This is true not only regarding
positive <i>mitzvos</i> but also, as the Talmud (<i>Kiddushin</i> 39b) teaches,
regarding one who withstood temptation and did not violate a negative
commandment, for whom it is reckoned On High as if he did a positive <i>mitzvah</i>.
However, while this understanding of the hidden treasures found in the <i>mitzvos</i>
might be an alluring factor to observe the <i>mitzvos</i> and thereby enrich
one's soul, it is for this reason that the verse concludes, "<i>Ani</i>
Hashem," to teach that the ideal performance of the <i>mitzvos</i> is for
His sake and not for one's personal enrichment.</p>

<P>Indeed, this is how the Gra understands <i>Birkas Hamitzvos</i>.
First we acknowledge, "<i>asher kidishanu b'mitzvosav</i> - that He has
sanctified us with His commandments", which is an incredible commitment by
Hashem to the Jewish people and perhaps provides sufficient motivation for one
to perform a <i>mitzvah</i> - to derive the personal spiritual elevation and
closeness to Hashem. Therefore, the <i>bracha</i> continues, "<i>v'tzivanu</i>
- and He commanded us", teaching us that ultimately we are to perform the
<i>mitzvos</i> because He, Hashem ordained their performance. The highest form
of service is to focus on serving the Master who commands the <i>mitzvah</i>,
rather than how the <i>mitzvah</i> benefits and enriches the performer of the <i>mitzvah</i>.
Thus, performance of <i>mitzvos</i> provides a double benefit: it nourishes and
enriches one's body and soul, and allows for a personal service and
relationship with Hashem.</p>

<P>The Vilan Gaon also teaches that the reverse is true
regarding the violation of transgressions. As the <i>mitzvos</i> maintain and
nourish the individual, so too in a natural way, <i>aveiros</i> - sins cause a
degeneration and atrophy of the soul. Just as in the natural world if one
ingests poison the deadly effect is not a punishment but rather a natural
consequence of one's actions, so too the negative action has a deteriorating effect
on the soul. This is familiar to us regarding the effect of non-Kosher food on
one's soul, as the Torah teaches (<i>Vayikra</i> 11:43), "<i>v'nitmesem</i>"
which is understood by our Ravs (<i>Yuma</i> 39a) as, "<i>v'netamtem</i>
- your soul will be dulled and weakened". This is true regarding
all the negative commandments of the Torah.</p>

<P>This conclusion is drawn by the Vilan Gaon from his sharp
analysis of the effect of Adam's sin. Hashem advised him to eat of all the
fruits in the Garden of Eden. Interestingly, notes the Meshech Chochma, had he
eaten from those fruits first, it could have fortified him to withstand the
temptation of eating from the forbidden fruit. Hashem warned him that were we
to eat from the tree of knowledge, he would die, which is understood by the
Ramban to not mean immediate death but rather becoming mortal. Thus when he
does eat from the forbidden tree, why is his punishment to work the land with
great difficulty, that the land should yield thorns and thistles, and to gain
his bread by the sweat of his brow? His punishment should have been simply that
he is now you mortal! The answer is as stated above, that his becoming mortal
was not the punishment but the natural consequence of eating from the forbidden
tree. Once Hashem said that on the day Adam eats from the tree he will die, the
transformation from immortal to mortal became a natural characteristic inherent
within the tree and was not a punishment per se. Adam deserved to be punished over
and above the natural consequences of his action for not listening to Hashem, and
that punishment consisted of the curses above listed. </p>

<P>Thus "<i>v'chai bahem</i>" teaches that the
observance of <i>mitzvos</i> is endowed with spiritual vitality, while the effect
of <i>aveiros</i> is decay and atrophy of the soul. However, the verse ends
with the sublime admonition of "<i>Ani</i> Hashem" - don't do <i>mitzvos</i>
primarily to build yourself and your character, but ideally you should do them to
serve Hashem.</p>

<P>Having begun with "<i>v'chai bahem</i>" and the
obligation to sustain life, I'd like to close by remembering the <i>Kedoshim</i>
of the <i>Shoah</i> who if they could trade with gentile prisoners their ration
of bread for soup, did so, as not to violate eating chametz on Pesach. Those
who <b>had</b> to eat chametz to fulfill "<i>v'chai bahem</i>" note
the emotional anguish that accompanied their eating of <i>chametz</i> on Pesach
by the prayer composed by the Ravs in Bergen-Belsen to be recited prior to
their eating of <i>chametz</i>: </p>

<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our Father in Heaven, it is known and revealed before Thee that it is our will to do Thy will and to
observe the festival of Passover through the eating of <i>matzah</i> and by not
violating the prohibition of <i>chametz</i>. For this our hearts are grieved -
that our enslavement prevents us and we are in danger of our lives. Behold, then.
We are prepared and ready to fulfill Thy commandment of 'though shall live by
them and not die by them' and to carefully heed the warning 'take therefore
good heed and guard thy life very much.' Therefore, it is our prayer unto Thee
that Thou keep us alive and preserve us and redeem us speedily so that we may
observe Thy statutes and do Thy will and serve Thee with a perfect heart. Amen.
</BLOCKQUOTE></p>

<P>May their fulfillment of "<i>v'chai bahem</i>"
under the most extreme and challenging conditions inspire us to fulfill and
appreciate "<i>v'chai bahem</i>" in happiness and excitement leading
up to "<i>Ani</i> Hashem".</p>

<P>At first glance it is most perplexing why the Torah would
devote over sixty verses to relate how Eliezer (whose name does not appear even
once) chooses a wife for Yitzchak. Our Ravs give an answer, (<i>Bereishis
Rabbah</i> 60:11) when they remind us that, "<i>yafeh sichson</i> - table
talk of the servants of our Patriarchs is even more beloved than the laws of
their children". The exact details and nuances are recorded and repeated
to teach us how to ideally live our lives.</p>

<P>The servant uses the character trait of <i>chessed</i> as
the criteria for eligibility to carry on the Abrahamic tradition. He looks for
"a little water" (24:17) and receives instead not only a drink for
him, but her drawing for all the ten camels that accompany him. It is <i>passuk</i>
21 and the commentary of the Seforno that I'd like to share. "The
man was astonished" at the <i>zerizos</i> - alacrity of being
totally engrossed in the service of kindness. "Reflecting silently",
the servant remains silent, not at any point saying the expected social nicety
of, "that's enough" or "you really
shouldn't", but rather waiting to see if she will complete her
service in the way of <i>chessed hagamur</i> - total <i>chessed</i>, not
looking or expecting any reward or compliment. Her persona demonstrated that
not only was she not expecting any gift or tip, but even a thank you was not
necessary. The test that Rifka passed was not only to see if she would
"speak little and do a lot" as Avraham did in his <i>hachnosas
orchim</i> but to see the level of total altruism, and that was the ultimate
litmus test, the <i>lishma</i> of her <i>chessed</i>.</p>

<P>I'd like to suggest that when beginning a new world
order, the foundation must be one of pure altruism and absolute kindness.
Hashem saves Noah in the <i>ark</i>. The Ramban (6:19) teaches that this was
absolutely miraculous, as ten arks could not house all the animals and food for
a year. Why, however, does Hashem not provide another miracle, namely an
automatic feeder in each compartment so that once a week Noach would fill it
and the animals would be nourished automatically? An answer is, as we find in
the last chapter of the <i>Gemara Sanhedrin</i>, that Shem, the son of Noach,
tells Eliezer, Avraham's servant, that they were busy literally day and
night feeding the animals. Why? The world was destroyed because of <i>chomas</i>,
a total breakdown of interpersonal behavior. To start the new world right one
needed to correct the flaws of old one; <i>olam chessed yibaneh</i> - the world
is based on <i>chessed</i>, and therefore Noach and his sons were busy
non-stop.</p>

<P>Similarly, Avraham <i>Avinu</i>, is establishing a new
world, the Jewish world. The foundation of this world as well needs to be built
not only on <i>chessed</i>, but in the words of the Seforno, <i>chessed hagamur</i>.
The <i>chessed</i> of Avraham demonstrated his total altruism, and this exalted
behavior had to be demonstrated by Yitzchak's wife, who must carry on this
trait of <i>chessed hagamur</i>.</p>

<P>There are two sources for the performance of <i>chessed</i>
in the Torah. The first is (<i>Vayikra</i> 19:18), "You shall love your
neighbor as yourself." The Ramban explains this mean that one should be
empathetic and feel for the next one in their particular situation as you would
want others to be there for you in your time of need. Dance at their wedding as
you would want people dancing at yours and visit them in their moment of
stress, sickness and loss, as you would want to be visited and remembered.</p>

<P>The second source comes from the end of the Torah. The six-hundred
and eleventh <i>mitzvah</i>, according to the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, is that
of (<i>Devarim</i> 28:9) "<i>v'halachta bedrachov</i> - and you
shall go in His ways." As He is just, kind and merciful, so must we be.
This charge to emulate the ways of Hashem significantly raises the bar and
expectations, not only in the manner of the fulfillment of the <i>chessed</i>,
but in the aftermath as well. Hashem does His <i>chessed</i> completely
altruistically.</p>

<P>A neighbor is out of work and you knock on his door and give
him an envelope of cash, this is a <i>chessed</i>. However, slipping it under
the door and running away is a higher <i>chessed</i>, approaching the <i>chessed
gamur</i> of the Seforno. (See the eight levels of giving charity as found in
the Rambam <i>Hilchos Matnas Aniyim</i> 10:7-14.)</p>

<P>The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 8a) states that one
giving charity on condition that their relative be cured, or that they should
earn a share in the world to come, is called a <i>tzadik gamur</i> - a
completely righteous individual. Tosfos (<i>ibid</i> 8b) asks that isn't one
not to serve Hashem on condition of getting rewarded, as stated in the first
chapter of <i>Avos</i> (1:3)? Tosfos answers that the one giving the charity is
completely sincere about the giving of the charity, and his giving is not
conditional on the cure of the sick individual such that if they are not cured,
he would not give. This individual is still a <i>tzadik gamur</i> as one can
have two simultaneous intentions, one for the <i>mitzvah</i>, one for the cure.</p>

<P>Eliezer is looking for the exceptional <i>chessed</i>. If
Rifka is to join the house of Avraham, for her to be the <i>amud hachessed</i> -
the beacon of <i>chessed</i> to exemplify and model for the progeny throughout
the generations, she had to perform <i>chessed hagamur</i>.</p>

<P>The Chofetz Chaim (in his book <i>Ahavas Chessed</i> 2:23)
teaches that ideally before one does a <i>chessed</i> they should first pause
and say to themselves: I am about to perform this particular <i>mitzvah</i>.
For example, before lending money to another Jew one should focus on fulfilling
the <i>mitzvah</i> of (<i>Shemos</i> 22:23) "<i>im kesef talveh</i>
- when you lend money." If one is privileged to get someone else a
job, one should focus on fulfilling (<i>Vayikra</i> 25:35) "<i>vehechezakta
bo</i> - support him." Before paying one's workers in a
timely way, focus on (<i>Devarim</i> 24:15) "<i>beyomo teetain sicharo</i>
- pay the wages on that day." It is rumored that before Rav
Elyashiv <i>zt"l</i> opened his door to respond to the many different
questions coming his way he would say to himself, I am about to fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i>
of <i>gemilus chasadim</i>.</p>

<P>The Chofetz Chaim further advances the performance of <i>chessed</i>,
by applying the dictum found in the <i>Talmud</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 50B) whereby
we are taught "a person should always engage in the study of Torah and
the performance of <i>mitzvos</i> even though it is not for its own sake,
because from learning Torah and performing a <i>mitzvah</i> not for its own
sake, he will eventually come to perform for its own sake." While this
teaching is usually associated with <i>mitzvos</i> man to G-d, the Chofetz
Chaim extends it as well to <i>mitzvos</i> man to man. One should do acts of
kindness, even if they may lack the element of complete or total altruism, since
with the continuous performance of acts of kindness, one will grow to aspire to
do so independent of any personal gain. The good feeling that one has after
being thanked for the <i>chessed</i>, and even if one is not thanked, the good
feeling that they have for having done something good, diminishes the <i>chessed</i>.
Ideally if one borrows money not only may they not pay interest, but even saying
"thank you" is shunned upon by the Ravs as a form of <i>ribis
d'varim</i>, a form of verbal interest. An appropriate response is <i>tizku
l'mitzvos</i>. When one realizes how advanced and different Jewish values
are from the rest of society, one can say on the one hand - <i>shver tzu
zein a yid</i>, and on the other hand I am so proud to be a Jew.</p>

<P>The<i> Medrash </i>(<i>Rus Rabbah </i>5:9) teaches that the
poor person does more for the donor than the donor does for him. This is
understood to mean that the poor individual, the recipient, transforms the
donor into a giver. When Naomi asks Rus the identity of the one from whose
field she gleaned, she responded (2:19) "the name of the man for whom I
did today is Boaz." By becoming a giver, Boaz becomes much closer to
Hashem who is the constant eternal giver.</p>

<P>I am reminded of the well known story of the <i>misnagid</i>
who wanted to know why the Rebbe was late in the winter months in coming to <i>shul</i>
in the morning. He once secretly followed the Rebbe and saw him go into the
forest to cut wood and bring it to a poor elderly woman's home and
prepare the fireplace concealing his identity. When the <i>chassid</i> said
that his Rebbe was late because he was in heaven preparing his thoughts for
prayer, the <i>misnagid</i> replied "if not higher". May we learn
from Rifka and ever venture higher in our performance of <i>chessed</i>.</p>

of sprinkling the ash of a <i>parah adumah</i> mixed with water after three and
seven days in order to attain purification. Today, unfortunately, we do not yet
have the <i>eifer haparah</i> for the sprinkling of a <i>parah adumah</i>.</p>

<P>The Torah does not explain <i>tumas meis</i> - the impurity
that is emitted from a deceased person. Perhaps it could be explained that just
as in life there are levels of holiness and sanctity, similarly in the absence
of life there is a vacuum and a spiritual void commensurate with the degree of
holiness that an individual had achieved. The more holiness, the greater the
observance of Torah and <i>mitzvos</i> and the greater one's personal
interaction with their fellow man, the more <i>tumah</i> - impurity will be created
after death.</p>

<P>The Shelah <i>Hakadosh</i> (in <i>Derech Chayim</i> on <i>Parshas
Chukas</i>) teaches that in the absence of the <i>parah adumah</i>, the
learning and living of Torah serves as the purifying factor in our lives. He
explains that in addition to the literal understanding of the sprinkling of the
<i>parah adumah</i> water on the third and seventh days, the Torah was given on
day three and enables us to attain day seven. This comment of the Shelah is
referring to the teaching of the Ramban (<i>Bereishis</i>, beginning of chapter
2) where he broadens our mystical horizons and demonstrates that the six days
of creation correspond to the six millennia. On the third day, that is, in the third
millennium of world history, we received the Torah and it enables us to attain
immortality of the soul, symbolized by the seventh day of total Shabbos.</p>

<P>That "Torah is life" may be seen from many
references in the <i>Chumash</i>. The Torah says, "you shall observe My
decrees and My laws, which man shall carry out and by which he shall live - I
am Hashem" (<i>Vayikra</i> 18:5). Rashi and the Targum both understand this
verse to refer to life in <i>Olam Habah</i>. This is akin to the Talmuds (<i>Eruvin</i>
22a) explaining the passuk, "hayom l'asosam" (<i>Devarim</i> 7:11) to
be teaching that today, i.e. this world, is for performing <i>mitzvos</i>, and
tomorrow, i.e. the world to come, is for receiving reward.</p>

<P>The Gra (in <i>Aderes Eliyahu</i>) understands the verse
cited above (<i>Vayikra</i> 18:5) to refer to this world. The Torah is
therefore teaching that even though the very nature of Torah and <i>mitzvos</i>
sustains life, one is not to perform them with a personal, physical benefit of
attaining life in mind, but rather as the verse ends, <i>Ani</i> Hashem - I am
Hashem, do it because I commanded it. Similarly, he says given the reality
highlighted by the text of every <i>bracha</i> recited prior to performing a <i>mitzvah</i>,
<i>asher k'dishanu b'mitzvosav</i>  Who has sanctified us with His
commandments, one might be excited to perform the <i>mitzvah</i> to receive
holiness and spirituality, therefore the text continues, <i>v'tzivanu</i> -
and He commanded us, instructing us to do the <i>mitzvah</i> for no ulterior
motives, be they physical or spiritual.</p>

<P>In <i>Nefesh HaChayim</i> (book 4, chapter 29) the primary
student of the Gra, Reb Chaim of Volozhin, quotes the Zohar saying that the 613
<i>mitzvos</i> correspond to the 613 physical components of the body (limbs,
sinews, etc.). When one fulfills a <i>mitzvah</i> he sanctifies and invigorates
that corresponding organ and part of the body. He follows in the path of his rebbe
and understands <i>v'chai bahem</i> most literally.</p>

<P>It is interesting to note that the world as we know it is
functioning in the <i>b'dieved</i> - second best, or plan B  mode. Initially,
man was to be eternal, and the phenomenon of death was not to be in this world.
Adam and Chava sinned, however, and death became part of life. We were given a
second chance at Sinai, as the Gemara (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 22b) teaches that at
Sinai <i>paska zu hamasa</i>n - the impurities and negative consequences of
sin were removed from them. Upon receiving the Torah the nation of Israel was,
"<i>kulach yaffa ra'ayazi u'mum ein bach</i> - beautiful my beloved,
blemish free." This is understood by <i>Chazal</i> to mean that all the
sick were healed at Sinai and the Torah literally revitalized them. Had they
not sinned with the golden calf, man could once again live eternally. Such is
the power of Torah.</p>

<P>In addition, not only does Torah fill the void of
spirituality that sets in as a result of death, thereby emulating the <i>eifer
haparah</i> (the ash of the <i>parah adumah</i> that was to be sprinkled on
the third day), but it also serves as the vehicle for future resurrection. The
Gemara (<i>Kesubos</i> 111b) cites Isaiah (26:19), "<i>hekitzu v'raninu
shochnei afar</i> <i>ki tal oros talecha</i> - awake and shout for joy you who
dwell in the dust, for your dew is like the dew on fresh ground and homiletically
explains it to mean that your light, Torah, is what will resurrect you and once
again give you life. The Talmud states quite unequivocally that a Jew who is
not connected to Torah will not be resurrected. When the Torah says (<i>Devarim</i>
30:20), "for He is your life and length of your days" this is no
exaggeration!</p>

<P>The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Brachos</i> 61b) relates that when it
was decreed by the Romans that the Jewish people should not study Torah, Rav
Akiva defied the edict by teaching Torah publicly. He offered a parable to
explain what this situation may be compared to: a fox was walking along a river
saw fish gathering from place to place as if constantly fleeing. The fox asked
them who they are running from to which they responded that they are fleeing the
nets that people bring to capture them. The fox said that the fish should come onto
dry land and be safe from the nets. The fish replied that the fox can't be the
most clever of the animals, rather he is but a fool. If in the natural climate,
water, that sustains a fishs life, they are afraid, then certainly they cannot
live on land without water. So too, Rav Akiva said, we must continue to engage
in Torah which is <i>chayecha v'orech yamecha</i> - our life and length of
days, and if we desist from Torah, we would be all the more in danger.</p>

<P>It is no coincidence that we find in the midst of the laws
of <i>tumas meis</i> regarding how impurity is transmitted to people, food and
utensils, the statement (19:14), "<i>zos haTorah, adam ki yamus b'ohel</i>
- this is the law regarding a man who dies in the tent. On the surface the
introductory words, "<i>zos haTorah</i>" seem extraneous. The Gemara (<i>Berachos</i>
63b) learns from this a very essential point for the study of Torah: "the words
of Torah are only retained by one who kills himself for it" i.e. by one
who sacrifices for Torah. Torah is not to be studied casually over a cup of
tea.</p>

<P>The Torah frames the purification process by saying,
"he shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day."
Torah, given on the third day-millennium purifies one and sets the stage for
the seventh day of eternity of the soul. "But if he will not purify
himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not become pure."</p>

<P>The <i>parsha</i> begins with "<i>zos chukas <u>haTorah</u></i>"
even though it really should have said "<i>zos chukas <u>haparah</u></i>."
I believe that an additional level of understanding in this <i>passuk</i> is that
only "<i>zos chukas <u>haTorah</u></i>" is going to keep us <i>tahor</i>
as a people throughout the millennia.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P><i>Parshas Ki Teitzei</i> has the distinction of having the
most <i>mitzvos</i> of any <i>parsha</i> in the Torah, namely seventy-four.
I'd like to focus on one which, at first glance, is not relevant to most
individuals, but upon deeper reflection, is truly most pertinent. The Torah
teaches (<i>Devarim</i> 22:10), "You shall not plow with an ox and a
donkey together." Rashi, citing the Sifri, provides the background of the
verse from the Oral Law, to include coupling of any two different species, one
kosher and the other not, for any kind of work.</p>

<P>While the Torah does not provide a reason for this
prohibition, the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (550) gives two reasons. He first
quotes his <i>rebbe</i>, the Rambam, who sees this prohibition stemming from
the prohibition of mating one animal with another species (as found in <i>Vayikra</i>
19:19), and having these animals work together in close proximity could lead to
their mating. Interestingly, the Ibn Ezra notes that working the ox and donkey
together would be a violation of <i>tzar baalei chaim</i>, inflicting pain on an
animal. The donkey, which is the weaker of the two, cannot pull the load as
well as the stronger ox. In addition, the <i>Daas Zekeinim m'Baalei
Tosfos</i> suggest that the Torah is concerned about the feelings and
sensitivities of the donkey. Both animals will be given their appropriate
portions of food. The ox however, being a kosher animal, chews his cud, when
the donkey hears the additional activity happening in the ox's stomach,
the donkey will believe that the ox has been given more food, and will be
psychologically distressed.</p>



<P>The <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> therefore maintains that included
as a logical extension of this <i>mitzvah</i> is the prohibition of being
insensitive to the feelings of the next individual. He offers the following
example: if a welcoming committee is being organized, do not intentionally pair
together two individuals of different nature, such as an extrovert and an
introvert, as the latter is going to feel deficient and incapable in this
endeavor. To the <i>Chinuch</i>, this <i>mitzvah</i> is not to be reckoned
among those that Hashem gave such as the prohibition of blood (see <i>Devarim</i>
12:23 and Rashi there) to provide the Jew with many <i>mitzvos</i> that he
fulfills daily to provide us with greater merit, but this <i>mitzvah</i> is most
relevant to all people at all times.</p>



<P>It is exciting to note that sensitivity to others is built
in to, or serves as the reason for, many <i>mitzvos</i> and practices. To begin
with, we find in this <i>parsha</i> that the Torah legislates the laws of <i>shikcha</i>,
meaning if one forgets a sheaf of grain or fruit of trees, they are to leave it
in the field for the poor and not go back and retrieve them. This law
accompanies that of <i>leket</i>, the gleanings that fall during the harvest,
and <i>peah</i>, the edge of the field that must be left unharvested for the
poor. The common denominator to these agricultural <i>mitzvos</i> is that the
Torah is teaching that these parts of the field are not yours, rather they
belong to the poor. However, rather than their knocking on your door and you
handing them the grain, here they work for it themselves, and this affords them
dignity and the wonderful feeling of satisfaction of enjoying the fruits of
their labor. Tremendous sensitivity for the poor.</p>



<P>A second example is the law (<i>Shemos</i> 22:24) that when
a Jew lends another money, he may not act towards him as a creditor. What does
that mean? It is clear that the borrower owes, yet the Torah is saying not to
act aggressively to get your money. The Talmud (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 75b)
understands this verse to mean that if Shabbos is a nice day, and the lender
would like to take a walk, he can do so on any street in the neighborhood
except that of the borrower. The reason for this is, lest the borrower think
that the reason the lender is passing by his house is to remind him of the loan
and his obligation, and he, the lender, would thus violate not to act towards
him as an oppressor!</p>



<P>A third example of sensitivity is found in the laws of the
repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim</i> 124).
We are taught that <i>Anshei Knesses HaGedolah</i> enacted that after the congregation
completes their private recitation of the <i>amidah</i> the <i>chazzan</i> is
to repeat the entire prayer. The reason for this, as explained at the end of
the <i>Gemara Rosh Hashana</i>, is to recite the prayer on behalf of the
unlearned individuals who don't know how to formulate the <i>amidah</i>, who
would thus fulfill their obligation by listening to the prayer of the <i>chazzan</i>.
I'd like to ask a basic question: why do we repeat the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>
at all times? Why not look around the shul or make an announcement, if anyone
is in need of the repetition, please raise your hand? We don't do this, rather
we always recite nineteen blessings without asking, lest somebody be
embarrassed and publicly humiliated by having to request the repetition. We
demonstrate sensitivity by reciting the repetition of the <i>Shemonah Esrei</i>.</p>



<P>A fourth example is from Tanach. We are taught in the first
chapter in the first book of Shmuel (the Haftorah for the first day of Rosh
Hashana), that Penina (Chana's co-wife), angered her repeatedly, Rav Levi
in the Gemara Baba Basra (16a) teaches that Penina's motives were pure
and sincere. Chana had no children, and Penina who had many, would constantly
speak of her children in Chana's presence which was extremely
insensitive. Despite the purity of her motives, which was to encourage Chana to
pray for children, we are taught that Penina was punished for her
insensitivity. This is a most pertinent lesson of how careful we are to speak
of our families in front of others who might not be as equally blessed. As
mentioned above the essence of this mitzvah is applicable at all times or
circumstances, especially in school settings where there are stronger or weaker
students.</p>



<P>One final example is that of the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>tzedakah</i>.
The Rambam (<i>Hilchos Matenos Aniyim </i>10:7) lists eight levels of
fulfilling this <i>mitzvah</i>. The highest one is that of "<i>v'hechezakta
bo</i>" (<i>Vayikra</i> 25:35), literally to take hold of the needy
individual and give him a job, independence and dignity; to remove him from the
category of being a taker to the potential of becoming a giver. Note, however,
that each level above the next is affording greater sensitivity to the needy
recipient. It is not only the giving but how the giving is done. If it is
accompanied by words of encouragement and endearment, the same act of charity
is significantly upgraded (<i>Bava Basra</i> 9b).</p>



<P>I'd like to note how very relevant this <i>mitzvah</i>
is, especially now as we rapidly approach <i>Rosh Hashana</i>. The Talmud (<i>Rosh
Hashana</i> 16a) teaches that our reciting verses of <i>Malchios</i> -
Kingship on Rosh Hashana is in order to accept His sovereignty upon ourselves.
The Sifri in <i>Parshas Vezos HaBracha</i> comments on the verse (33:5) "<i>vayehi
b'Yeshurun melech</i>" that when we are united as a people, the
more glorified and established as King Hashem is. The extent of His Kingship is
commensurate with the unification of His subjects in their acceptance and
allegiance to Him. Thus the prerequisite for coronating Hashem on <i>Rosh
Hashana</i>, one of the primary reasons for blowing the shofar, is to assure
Him that we are all united as a people. Thus it behooves us to implement "<i>v'ahavta
lreacha kamocha</i>" (<i>Vayikra</i> 19:18), and not to plow with the ox
and donkey, meaning, to show greater sensitivity to one another thereby
assuring for us a warmer reception from our Father, our King.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>Every day brings us one day closer to the third <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>.
It is therefore with a sense of excitement that we read and study these <i>parshiyos</i>
dealing with the <i>Mishkan</i>, eagerly awaiting and anticipating what will
occur. Interestingly, the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, in identifying the seven <i>mitzvos</i>
found in <i>Parshas Tetzaveh</i>, follows his mentor the Rambam and lists the
donning of the <i>bigdei Kehuna</i> by the <i>kohanim</i> as a <i>mitzvah</i>.
The Ramban disagrees and sides with <i>Ba'al Halachos Gedolos</i> who
considers the <i>bigdei Kehuna</i> a <i>hechsher mitzvah</i>, a necessary
prerequisite and component for the performance of the <i>avodah</i> (service in
the <i>Mikdash</i>), but not an independent <i>mitzvah</i>.</p>

<P>A regular Kohen had to wear four garments, a <i>kesones</i>
- shirt, <i>michnasayim</i> - pants, <i>mikbaas</i> - turban,
and <i>avneit</i> - belt. In addition, the Kohen <i>Gadol</i> wore four
additional garments, each containing gold. What is most interesting and
perplexing is that the belt of the Kohen contained <i>sha'atnez</i>
- wool and linen together - and for this reason, according to the Rambam,
as soon as the Kohen completed his <i>avodah</i> he removed the <i>avneit</i>
immediately as the wearing of <i>sha'atnez</i> was only permitted during
the actual time of service. I'd like to explore why the Kohen had to wear
and incorporate <i>sha'atnez</i> as part of his service.</p>

<P>The prohibition of <i>sha'atnez</i> found in <i>Devarim</i>
(22:11), "you shall not wear combined fibers, wool and linen
together," is most certainly a <i>chok</i>, meaning a law whose reason we
don't know. In <i>Vayikra</i> (19:19) the Torah commands, "you
shall observe My decrees...and a garment that is a mixture of combined
fibers shall not come upon you." While the Torah does not provide a
reason for this law, the Rambam (<i>Hilchos Temurah</i> 4:13) enjoins us to
explore and understand, to the best of our ability, all of the Torah including
the <i>chukim</i>. The<i> Medrash Tanchuma</i> (<i>Bereishis</i> 9:9) teaches
that the source of the prohibition of <i>sha'atnez</i> indeed stems from
the encounter of Cain and Hevel. The Torah teaches (<i>Bereishis</i> 4:3),
"after a period of time" (which the <i>Tanchuma</i> suggests is when
they were 40 years old) Cain brought an offering to Hashem of the fruit of the
ground. The <i>medrash</i> continues to cite the Ravs who understood
Cain's offering to be that of flax/linen. "Hevel, he also brought
of the firstlings of his flock and from their choicest." The <i>Medrash Tanchuma</i>
explains that it is for this reason that <i>sha'atnez</i> was prohibited,
as Hashem declared that after the sin of fratricide it is not proper that we
commingle the offering of the sinner with that of the righteous.</p>

<P>It is interesting to note that every Friday night following <i>Shalom
Aleichem</i> we honor the woman of the household with the singing of <i>Aishes Chayil</i>.
The fourth line is the approbation (<i>Mishlei</i> 31:13), "she seeks out
wool and linen." With the above Tanchuma we praise her for her ability to
differentiate between wool - good, and linen - bad. Her <i>binah yeseirah</i>
gives her greater insight and intuition.</p>

<P>So why must the Kohen wear <i>sha'atnez</i>? Perhaps
to help us realize the specialty of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> which is in a
realm above us. The Maharal (in his commentary on <i>Avos</i>, <i>Derech HaChaim</i>,
1:12) teaches that we live in the world of <i>preidah</i> - separation.
It is interesting to note that the Maharal gives the example of Cain killing
Hevel as the beginning of this world representing the world of <i>preidah</i> -
divisiveness. Too much emphasis is placed upon that which divides us - <i>Ashkenaz</i>
and <i>Sefard</i>, <i>Chasid</i> and <i>Misnagid</i>, observant and not-yet
observant. The <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> is the ultimate <i>meacheid</i> -
unifier. Yerushalayim, which is an extension of the <i>Mikdash</i>, is
described by Dovid HaMelech (<i>Tehillim</i> 122:3) as, "the built-up
Jerusalem is like a city that is unified together." Moreover, when Yaakov
awakens from his majestic dream of the ladder reaching Heavenward, he proclaims
(<i>Bereishis</i> 28:17) "this is the gate of the Heavens." The <i>Beis
HaMikdash</i> connected Heaven and earth. Shlomo <i>HaMelech</i>, in his
thanksgiving address at the occasion of the dedication of the first <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>
(<i>Melachim</i> I 8:41), speaks of Jew and non-Jew turning to this house to
offer prayers. The <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> is that opportunity of connecting with
Hashem and gleaning a portend of what will be in the future. At that time the
world will be elevated to a higher level of <i>achdus</i>/unification. The
Kohen who blesses the people with love, unifies not only the nation of Israel,
but also the different spheres of existence, including animal and vegetable. He
unites these different realms, even as they appear metaphysically in an
oppositional state. Thus, the Kohen's wearing of <i>sha'atnez</i> reflects
the future harmonious existence that will elevate not only man, but nature as
well. </p>

<P>Perhaps, as we pray thrice daily for the rebuilding of the <i>Beis
HaMikdash</i>, we can each in our own way gradually work on removing the
barriers that exist between us. The verse (<i>Shir HaShirim</i> 7:2), "How
lovely are your footsteps shod in pilgrim's sandals, oh daughter of nobles"
is understood by the Talmud (<i>Chagigah</i> 3a) to portray the ultimate unity
of all Jews ascending to the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> to celebrate the three
pilgrim festivals. There will not be a <i>Sefard</i> or <i>Ashkenaz Beis
HaMikdash</i>, not a <i>Chasidish</i> or <i>Litvish</i> one, or one for
observant or not-yet observant Jews. We should therefore, now, attempt to
intentionally visit and experience the flavor and teachings of those in other Orthodox
circles. Become familiar with the teachings of Rav Nachman of Breslov, or the
Alter Rebbe, or other groups. The benefit is not only "<i>mikol melamdai
hizkalti</i> - from all my teachers I grew wise" (<i>Tehillim</i> 119:99),
rather, the social interaction, respect, and recognition is an important first
step towards unity. Instead of the sad, humorous lesson of the Jew
stranded on a desert Island who builds two shuls and explains, "this is
the one I daven in, and this one not," we should feel comfortable in all <i>Batei
Kneisios</i>, preparing us for the elevated time when the Kohen will once again
wear the belt of <i>sha'atnez</i>, symbolizing the higher world of <i>achdus</i>,
not divisiveness.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Preparing for Pesach]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Daniel Stein]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2020]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Moadim: pesach]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>At the beginning of <i>Parshas Vayikra</i>, Hashem
called to Moshe before their conversation inside the <i>Ohel</i> <i>Moed</i>.
Rashi explains that even though Hashem revealed himself to the prophets of the other
nations abruptly and without warning in a manner which is described as
"and Hashem happened to meet Balaam" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 23:4), Hashem
called to Moshe prior to speaking with him as an expression of personal affection.
The <i>Sfas Emes</i> explains further that Hashem announced his meeting with
Moshe beforehand in order to give Moshe time to properly prepare himself for
their encounter. Rav Tzadok Hakohen (<i>Pri Tzaddik</i>), derives from here
that in order for any spiritual experience to be meaningful and leave a lasting
impact upon us we must first ready ourselves sufficiently beforehand. Only if
we make a concerted effort to appreciate the value and significance of what is
about to occur can we internalize and assimilate the message and lesson that is
being conveyed.</p>

<P>Whenever we experience a moment of genuine
spiritual inspiration, if we are unprepared for it in advance, its
effectiveness will be muted and its ability to serve as a catalyst for real
change will invariably be diminished. At the time of <i>keriyas Yam Suf</i> the
people present pointed at Hashem and unequivocally declared, "This is my
God and I will glorify him" (<i>Shemos</i> 15:2). The <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>
(section 244) comments that even the maidservants at <i>keriyas</i> <i>Yam</i> <i>Suf</i>
were granted a more intense divine revelation than that which was experienced
by both Yechezkel and Yishayahu. Nonetheless, despite this awesome and overwhelming
event the maidservants did not become prophetesses, they remained maidservants.
Rav Chaim Shmuelevtiz (<i>Sichas Mussar</i>) suggests that this was because the
maidservants entered into the moment unprepared, they invested nothing in
advance, and therefore they received nothing in return. The degree to which a
spiritual experience impacts upon us is directly dependent and contingent upon
the amount of effort we expended preparing for it beforehand.</p>

<P>The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Gittin</i> 77a) states that
the three days prior to Shabbos, from Wednesday to Friday, are attributed to
the following Shabbos, and the three days following Shabbos, from Sunday to
Tuesday, are related to the previous Shabbos. The Shem Mishmuel explains that
the holiness of Shabbos continues for an additional three days precisely
because we invested three days beforehand. Since we prepared for three days in
advance of Shabbos, the impact of the Shabbos can be felt for an additional
three days after Shabbos, corresponding exactly to the measure of effort we invested
beforehand. For this reason as well, the <i>Gemara</i> in <i>Gittin</i> claims
that the influence of <i>yom tov</i> lasts for a period of thirty days
following the conclusion of <i>yom tov</i>. This too is a function of the
requirement mentioned in the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 6a) to prepare
before Pesach for a period of thirty days. Since we prepared for a period of
thirty days before yom tov, the influence of the <i>yom tov</i> also continues
for an additional thirty days.</p>

<P>However, according to some <i>rishonim</i> (see <i>Biur
Halacha</i> 429:1) the obligation to prepare for thirty days prior to <i>yom
tov</i> is limited to the <i>yom tov</i> of Pesach. This is supported by the <i>Gemara</i>
(<i>Megillah</i> 32a) which implies that on every other <i>yom tov</i> it is
sufficient to review the laws of that particular <i>yom tov</i> on the day of <i>yom
tov</i> itself. Pragmatically, the <i>yom tov</i> of Pesach might demand extra
preparation since it encompasses so many intricate and complicated laws.
However, perhaps the <i>yom</i> <i>tov</i> of Pesach needs a greater investment
of time beforehand since the impact of Pesach must endure well beyond the
conclusion of the <i>yom tov</i>. It is during the <i>yom tov</i> of Pesach
that we must cultivate and refortify our foundation of <i>emunah</i> and <i>bitachon</i>
that will sustain us throughout the coming year, therefore, in order to create
this effect, we must prepare well in advance of Pesach as well.</p>

<p>As a result of the coronavirus crisis which is gripping
our community and the entire world, preparing for Pesach this year will
undoubtably require an even greater effort than usual. However, if we invest
properly in preparing for Pesach, may the themes of Pesach define our home and
our lives throughout the coming year, and may we be <i>zoche</i> to a <i>refuah</i>
and a redemption as individuals and as a community, culminating with the
ultimate <i>geulah</i> <i>be'meheirah be'yameinu</i>.</p>

<P>The Alter of Kelm (<i>Chachma Umusar</i>, vol. 1, page 10)
makes a very interesting observation regarding Moshe's initial encounter with
Pharoh. The Torah informs (<i>Shemos</i> 4:29) us that Moshe and Aharon gather
the elders of <i>Bnei Yisroel</i>, shared with them Hashem's
communication, and performed the signs that Hashem had given them. This is
followed by the concluding verse in that chapter that the people believed that
Hashem had remembered them and saw their affliction. This is immediately
followed by the Torah relating that Moshe and Aharon came to Pharoh, uninvited,
and delivered the Divine message to free the Israelite slaves. The Alter asks,
would it not have made more sense for Moshe and Aharon to go to Pharoh, as they
were told to do by Hashem, and subsequently report back to the people that the
process of redemption has already begun? The people would have been so much
more excited upon hearing that Moshe and Aharon daringly appeared before the
mighty Pharoh of Egypt unannounced. The answer is that it was only the
merit of the <i>emunah</i> - faith that the people had upon hearing
Moshe's report from Hashem that enabled Moshe and Aharon to go with confidence
to Pharoh. The exodus from Egypt began with the <i>emunah</i> of the
Jewish people.</p>

<P>Similarly, the miraculous salvation of <i>krias Yam Suf</i>,
which was the culmination of the <i>geulah</i> for the Jewish nation, occurred
based on the impetus of the peoples' <i>emunah</i>. This is taught
explicitly by Rabbeinu Bachya in his commentary at the beginning at <i>parshas
Beshalach</i>, where he says that the sea did not split all at once, rather they
proceeded with the waters literally up to their nostrils and were motivated by
their <i>emunah</i> to proceed further, and this is what produced the splitting
of the <i>yam</i>. Moreover, Rabbeinue Bachya writes regarding the <i>passuk</i>
(<i>Shemos</i> 12:13), "I shall see the blood and I shall pass
over you, there shall not be a plague of destruction upon you when I strike in
the land" that it was not the blood on the doorpost that protected
them from any harm, but rather the Torah is teaching us that whoever had
complete and total <i>emunah</i>/trust in G-d, and disregarded Pharoh's
decree and publicly slaughtered the god of Egypt, was worthy of protection
that night.</p>

<P>Note that in the <i>Hallel</i> that we will recite on the
forthcoming <i>yom tov</i>, we contrast the emptiness and
powerlessness of other gods with the infinite qualities of Hashem. <i>Tehillim</i>
(115:8) states, "those who make them should become like them, whoever
trusts in them". This powerful teaching of King David is
describing the emptiness and moral values of those who adhere to idolatry
and the richness of character for those who believe in Hashem, as
His essence adorns and elevates them. The individual who believes in
Hashem is transformed to the state of being a <i>tsaddik</i>, as noted
by the prophet Havakkuk (2:4), "the righteous person shall
live through his faith".</p>

<P>It is most interesting to note that the Medresh (<i>Shemos
Rabba</i> 3:4) teaches that what occurred in conjunction with our
first <i>geulah</i> will repeat itself on the occasion of the final
redemption. Thus, Hashem assured Yaakov (<i>Bereishis</i> 46:4), "<i>anochi
</i>- I shall descend with you to Egypt, I shall also bring you
up", and similarly at the burning bush Hashem utilized the same word "<i>anochi</i>"
(<i>Shemos</i> 3:6) to announce the forthcoming immediate redemption. So
too, continues the <i>Medrash</i>, the Jewish people will once again be
redeemed with "<i>anochi</i>", as promised by the prophet Malachi
(3:23), "I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and
awesome day of Hashem".</p>

<P>There are many things that we do at the <i>Pesach Seder</i>
which, at first glance, are contradictory in nature. The first example
is that we introduce the <i>Maggid</i> section of the <i>Haggadah</i>
by presenting the <i>matzah</i> and describing it as the bread that
we ate in the land of Egypt. Indeed, Seforno (<i>Devarim</i> 16:3) teaches
that the Egyptians fed us <i>matzah</i> during our period of
slavery. However, later on <i>Rabban</i> Gamliel mandates that we must
explain that the reason for our eating <i>matzah</i> on this night is to
remember our being hurried out of Egypt so quickly that we did not have
time to sufficiently bake our <i>chametz</i>. Which one is it? Is
it the bread of slavery or the bread of freedom? The answer, we know,
is both! Imagine sitting at the very first <i>Seder</i> in Egypt and
this is your thanksgiving dinner, and when you are told to celebrate with <i>matzah</i>
your first reaction has to be - "impossible!" Yet,
this is the incredible ability of the Jew to completely transform the
same <i>matzah</i> from slavery to freedom.</p>

<P>I'd like to go back to that first Pesach <i>Seder</i>. Why
is it that they had to finish the <i>Seder</i> before <i>chatzos</i> - midnight? It
seems so strange! At that point in time nothing had happened. Moshe warned
Pharoh, and indeed the whole land of Egypt knew, that Hashem on
or about midnight would kill all first born in Egypt. Until midnight,
however, nothing happened yet, so what were they celebrating? And why
did they have to finish their meal <u>before</u> <i>chatzos</i>, when <i>makkas
bechoros</i> would occur? The answer is most powerful: they were celebrating
their faith, their belief that Hashem would free them at <i>chatzos</i>. Therefore,
it is so exciting that annually we finish our meal by <i>chatzos</i> and
we eat the <i>afikomen</i> by <i>chatzos</i> to demonstrate our
belief that just as He extracted our ancestors in the merit of
their <i>emunah</i>, so too will He free us of our tRavails in accordance
with our <i>emunah</i>.</p>

<P>Today, we are facing an unprecedented reality - never
before has the entire world literally been shut down. If anybody were to
say, "I don't see the Corona virus, so it is not out not there",
we would understandably describe it as idiocy. Similarly, we
cannot see Hashem but only He could effect this total world shutdown. This
idea is in the very words of the <i>Haggadah</i> that we will recite shortly in
which our Ravs explain the verse (<i>Shemos</i> 12:12), "I will pass
through the land of Egypt on that night" to mean, "I and
no angel, I and no <i>saraph</i>, I and no messenger, I, Hashem, and
no other!"</p>

<P>The above is not meant to engender fear and tension, but to
remember that He is <i>Avinu</i>, our Loving Father, first and
foremost and then <i>Malkeinu</i>, our King. I trust that the following
story will help any who might be overwhelmed with nervousness. The
Rambam was the doctor of the Sultan in Egypt. His having
this prestigious position aroused the jealousy of many
doctors. Word reached the Sultan, and he devised a method of determining
who is the greatest doctor. He asked both the Rambam and the other
contender for his position to each prepare a poisonous potion for the other
to drink, and if they can save themselves that shows that they are truly a
master of their profession. The Rambam drank first. I wish I could
tell everybody what herbs and medications he took, but he survived. The
other doctor drank the Rambam's drink and died 5 days later. The
Sultan asked the Rambam what he put in the drink. The Rambam answered, He
said, "bye your life, there was nothing but a glass of
water"! The Rambam then went on to explain that
the other individual died from nervousness. He was so concerned
every moment, maybe it could be this, what's in there, maybe it
could be that, that his nerves literally consumed him. We must all learn
from the above. We left Mitzrayim because of our <i>emunah</i>. Rav
Yaakov Emden <i>z"tl</i> teaches that there is only one miracle greater
than that of the exodus, and that is the survival of the Jewish nation. We
survived because of our <i>emunah</i>. What's in your <i>matzah</i>? The
Zohar teaches that aside from the flour and water there is one more ingredient,
namely <i>emunah</i>. What is getting us through this great challenge is
the <i>matzah</i> we ate last Pesach, and G-d willing the <i>matzah</i>
that we will eat this coming <i>leil haSeder</i> will energize us in
our <i>emunah</i> until the coming of <i>Mashiach</i>.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[There is Nothing More Beautiful Than Serving Hashem <i>Be'Tznius</i>]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Daniel Stein]]></author>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: bamidbar]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>At the outset of their relationship, Hashem communicated
with Moshe outdoors and in public, first at the burning bush and then later in Mitzrayim.
However, the <i>pasuk</i> states that subsequently, "Hashem spoke to
Moshe in the desert of Sinai from within the <i>Ohel</i> <i>Moed</i>" (<i>Bamidbar</i>
1:1). The <i>Medrash Rabba</i> (<i>Bamidbar</i> 1:3) comments that following
the construction of the Mishkan, Hashem only spoke to Moshe from within the <i>Ohel</i>
<i>Moed</i>, for Hashem typically prefers to operate discreetly and indoors as
it says, "walk modestly with your God" (<i>Micha</i> 6:8), and it
is for this reason that Hashem is described in general as a "God who
conceals Himself," (<i>Yeshaya</i> 45:15). A similar transition occurred
in connection with the giving of the Torah. The <i>Medrash</i> <i>Tanchuma</i> (<i>Ki</i>
<i>Sisa</i> 31) claims that the first set of <i>luchos</i> were broken precisely
because they arrived amidst great attention and fanfare which leads the <i>Medrash</i>
to conclude that "there is nothing more beautiful than <i>tznius.</i>"
In order to protect the second set of <i>luchos</i> from a similar fate, Moshe
was instructed to fashion them while alone and in private as the <i>pasuk</i>
says, "carve for <u>yourself</u> two tablets of stone like the first ones"
(<i>Shemos</i> 34:1).</p>

<P>The value of being removed from the public eye is further
supported by the Gemara (<i>Bava</i> <i>Metzia</i> 42a) which comments that, "blessings
can only exist regarding objects that are concealed." Moreover, the Gemara
(Sukkah 49b and Moed Katan 16a) asserts, that even those events which are
generally held in public, such as a wedding, funeral, or even teaching Torah,
should nonetheless be conducted with the greatest degree of discretion possible.
The expansive range and scope of these comments indicates that the imperative
to conduct ourselves privately and with <i>tznius</i> is not limited to our wardrobe
choices or modes of attire, but rather encompasses all of our interactions and indeed
defines our very way of life.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>
This is underscored by the manner in which Balak praises the Jewish People, "How
good are your tents, Yaakov" (Bamidbar 24:5), referring to the
arrangement of their tents which opened in opposite directions in order to
prevent one from peering into the home of another.</p>

<P>The central message of <i>tznius</i> is illuminated
by the <i>Maharal</i> (<i>Nesivos</i> <i>Olam</i>) who writes that the meaning
and significance of an object or event which is open to the public and exposed in
plain sight is limited to that which can be observed and is on display. Conversely,
an item which is hidden and concealed suggests that it possesses greater depth
and therefore should not be judged superficially. This is comparable to the tip
of an iceberg whose spire protrudes above the water but at the same time hints
that its true girth and might resides beneath the surface. For this reason,
while the Mishkan was in transit, Bnei Yisrael were commanded to cover the
furniture and utensils, "so that they not go inside and witness the
dismantling of the Sanctuary lest they die" (<i>Bamidbar</i> 4:20). Rav
Sternbuch (<i>Taam V'daas</i>) explains that the pieces of the Mishkan
were wrapped and concealed deliberately in order to convey to any potential spectators
that the ultimate purpose of the Mishkan and its utensils were beyond their
grasp and all human understanding.</p>

<P>Given the general emphasis on <i>tznius</i> and
privacy it is not surprising, that the holiest items and places within the Mishkan
were guarded by numerous coverings and layers designed to protect its contents
and restrict access. This notion is punctuated by the <i>avodah</i> of the
Kohen Gadol on Yom Kippur which was performed entirely in solitude, as the <i>pasuk</i>
states, "nobody else shall be in the <i>Ohel Moed</i> until he comes
out" (<i>Vayikra</i> 16:17). Additionally, Moshe was commanded at <i>Har
Sinai</i> to ascend the mountain by himself and to instruct the rest of the
nation to remain behind for "nobody else shall come up with you, and
nobody else shall be seen anywhere on the mountain" (<i>Shemos</i> 34:3).
The <i>Degel Machaneh Efraim</i> (<i>Matos</i>) derives from these instances
that intense spiritual experiences can only materialize while one is secluded,
removed from all societal limitations and expectations. Perhaps, the Mishnah (<i>Avos</i>
2:5) which states, "in the place where there is no man strive to be a
man," can also be interpreted creatively, "strive to be a man who
serves Hashem like he is in a place where there are no other men."
Therefore, Rav Tzadok Hakohen (<i>Tzidkos Hatzaddik</i>) writes that even when davening
together with the rest of the community, one should attempt to imagine as if he
is conversing privately with Hashem.</p>

<P>However, if the quiet and understated nature which
accompanied the second set of <i>luchos</i> is ideal, why were the first set of
<i>luchos</i> introduced with such pomp and circumstance in the first place?
The <i>Sfas</i> <i>Emes</i> (<i>Ki</i> <i>Sisa</i>) deduces that public
performances are occasionally necessary in order to initially infuse an
endeavor with a certain measure of excitement and enthusiasm which can only be
generated by a large and impressive gathering. For this reason, we occasionally
applaud the accomplishments of young children in public and celebrate their
milestones together with the community. However, as a child matures and
develops it is critical that we instill within them the belief that
"there is nothing more beautiful than <i>tznius</i>." They must be taught
that their lives and actions are inherently consequential in the eyes of Hashem
even if it is not "commented" upon by others or "liked"
by someone else. We have to convince them, that from the perspective of <i>Yiddishkeit</i>,
the more something is concealed the more valuable it is, and the more an
activity or accomplishment is publicized the less special it becomes, not the
reverse. </p>

<p>Similarly, the <i>Maharshal</i> (<i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i>,
<i>Kesubos</i> 1:17) claims that the glass which is broken at a wedding by the <i>chosson</i>
is an allusion to the <i>shevrias</i> <i>haluchos</i>. Rav Soloveitchik (cited
in <i>Divrei HaRav</i> pg. 229) suggests that this symbol serves as a reminder
to the <i>chosson</i> and <i>kallah</i> that the public nature of their
relationship at the time of their wedding is not sustainable, just like the
first set of <i>luchos</i>. Over time, as their relationship deepens and
matures their home should evolve from a <i>chuppah</i> where the entire
community is invited to watch, into a sealed domain whose entrance is obscured
from its neighbors. The coronavirus pandemic which has confined us to our houses
has also refocused our attention on the concept of <i>tznius</i> and the
importance of cultivating a private relationship with Hashem. Whenever we
emerge from this predicament and are able to reconvene as a community, (it
should hopefully be soon and in good health), we should tRavel forth with this same
orientation and mindset, to continue to walk modestly with Hashem at all times,
for there is nothing more beautiful and beneficial than <i>tznius</i>.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[The Cup of Hope]]></title>
		<author><![CDATA[Rav Daniel Stein]]></author>
		<date><![CDATA[2020]]></date>
		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: vaera]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>According to the Talmud Yerushalmi (<i>Pesachim</i>
10:1), the four cups of wine that we drink at the Pesach <i>seder</i>,
correspond to the four expressions of redemption including, "I will take
you out", "I will deliver you", "I will redeem you", and
"I will acquire you" (<i>Shemos</i> 6:6-7). This is to extenuate that our redemption from <i>Mitzrayim</i>
took place in phases and entailed four distinct aspects, namely, our geographical
removal from the land of <i>Mitzrayim</i>, our physical freedom from the bonds
of slavery, our emergence as an emotionally liberated nation, and our spiritual
designation as the chosen people. However, some <i>rishonim</i> cite an alternative
version of the Gemara (<i>Pesachim</i> 118a) which records the existence of a fifth
cup of wine. The Raavad in his commentary to the Rif (<i>Pesachim</i> 26b) as
well as the Daas Zekeinim m'Baalei Ha'Tosfos (<i>Shemos</i> 12:8) claim
that this additional cup reflects a fifth manifestation of the redemption,
"and I will bring you into the land" (<i>Shemos</i> 6:8), referring
to our development as a sovereign state in the Land of Israel.</p>

<P>Since the <i>rishonim</i> debate the legitimacy of this
text of the Gemara, and the existence of a fifth cup altogether, as well as the
permissibility of drinking extraneous amounts of wine at the end of the Pesach <i>seder</i>,
the fifth cup is traditionally only poured but not imbibed. The Vilna Gaon asserts
that this compromise is the basis for our practice regarding the cup of Eliyahu,
which is ceremoniously filled towards the conclusion of the <i>seder</i>, but
is left untouched, for it is Eliyahu who will resolve all Talmudic disputes including
the validity or necessity of a fifth cup of wine. However, perhaps the fifth
cup is ascribed to Eliyahu, not only because he alone will resolve its <i>halachically</i>
controversial status, but also because it is associated with the culmination of
our ultimate redemption and the resettlement of the Land of Israel in the times
of <i>Moshiach</i> which will be heralded and preceded by the return of Eliyahu
<i>hanavi</i>.</p>

<P>Indeed, Rav Meir Horowitz of Dzikov (<i>Imrei</i> <i>Noam</i>)
notes that the numerical value of the fifth term of deliverance, "and I
will bring you" - "<i>ve'heveisi</i>" - is four hundred
and twenty four, and equal to that of "<i>Moshiach ben David</i>", which
further underscores that this expression is connected with the coming of <i>Moshiach</i>
and the future redemption. For this reason, the fifth cup is prepared but not
consumed, because despite our confidence in the final <i>geulah</i>, we can only
rejoice and toast its arrival after it has materialized. This is supported by
Rav Chaim Soloveitchik's (quoted in <i>Emek</i> <i>Bracha</i>)
interpretation of the <i>pasuk</i>, "But I have trusted in Your mercy, my
heart shall rejoice in Your salvation, I will sing to the Lord for He has dealt
bountifully with me" (<i>Tehillim</i> 13:6), where he explains that while
we can preemptively "rejoice in God's salvation" since it is inevitable,
it is only appropriate to celebrate externally and sing to the Lord, or raise
our glasses in triumph, after the <i>geulah</i> has actually occurred.</p>

<P>Nevertheless, even though the fifth cup of wine cannot
presently be enjoyed, it must be prepared, in order to demonstrate our
persistent yearning for the advent of <i>Moshiach</i>. The fifth cup serves as a
symbol of our eternal hope and constant anticipation of the final <i>geulah</i>,
which enables us to withstand what can appear to be an interminable <i>galus</i>.
Yaakov <i>Avinu</i> summoned his children at the end of his life and attempted
to disclose to them the precise date of the end of days. His plan was thwarted
by Hashem, but his intentions were clear, as the ensuing <i>pasuk</i> states,
"For your salvation I hope Hashem" (<i>Breishis</i> 49:18). Yaakov
understood that in order to persevere throughout the long journey of <i>galus</i>
<i>Mitzrayim</i>, <i>Klal</i> <i>Yisrael</i> would need to be able to hope and foresee
a brighter future for themselves. In fact, the Kozhnitzer Maggid (<i>Avodas
Yisrael</i>) notes that from the start of <i>Parshas</i> <i>Mikeitz</i> until
this <i>pasuk</i> in <i>Parshas</i> <i>Vayechi</i> the name of <i>Havaya</i> - which
reflects the merciful aspect of Hashem's providence - is entirely absent.
This is because <i>Parshas Mikeitz</i> marked the beginning of a prolonged
period of <i>galus</i>, which ostensibly eclipsed any trace of mercy or
compassion. However, through the penetrating power of hope it is possible to
pierce through even heaviest veil of darkness, and to begin to discern the
infinite mercy of Hashem.</p>

<P>It seems that <i>galus</i> is only manageable when
there is at least a glimmer of hope for redemption. For this reason, none of
the cities of refuge, where an accidental murderer could be exiled and
protected, were operational prior to the final conquest of <i>Eretz</i> <i>Yisrael</i>.
The Meshech Chochmah (<i>Masei</i>) explains that this is because the detention
of the accidental murder can only be alleviated and dismissed by the death of
the <i>Kohen</i> <i>Gadol</i>, and Hashem had already pledged that
Ahron's successor, Eliezer Hakohen, would live to oversee the entire
process of conquering and dividing <i>Eretz</i> <i>Yisrael</i>. Therefore,
during this transitional stage of Jewish history, any accidental murderer
sentenced to <i>galus</i> would have had no potential path towards parole or liberation.
This kind of bleak existence is so harsh and excruciating that it could not be
justified as a punishment for any crime committed inadvertently.</p>


<p>For this reason, at the very same moment that Hashem
informed Avraham that, "your descendants will be strangers in a land that
is not theirs, and they will be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years"
(<i>Breishis</i> 14:13), Hashem also foretold that, "the nation that they
will serve, I will judge, and afterwards they will go forth with great
possessions" (<i>Breishis</i> 14:14). Why was it necessary to foreshadow
to the manner of their emancipation before the period of slavery had even
begun? Rav Yerucham Levovitz (<i>Daas</i> <i>Torah</i>) suggests that this
relationship underscores that our ability to endure the difficulties of <i>galus</i>
is directly dependent on the prospect and promise of salvation. Therefore, the
Rambam in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 10:1) demands
that we not only believe in the coming of <i>Moshiach</i>, but that we also resolve
to "wait for him every day." It is this kind of optimistic mindset,
our hope for deliverance and rescue, that will propel us to the time of our
true redemption when we can rejoice fully and enjoy all five cups of wine at
the <i>seder</i>, with the rebuilding of the <i>Beis</i> <i>Hamikdash</i> <i>be'meheirah
be'yameinu</i>!</p>

		<tag><![CDATA[Parsha: shmini]]></tag>
		<content><![CDATA[

<P>There are some <i>parshios</i> that seem to have little
"luck". One such <i>parsha</i> is <i>Parshas Shmini</i>, which
usually follows Pesach, making it feel very anticlimactic - sort of a
side note to days of such import. The beginning of the <i>parsha</i>, which
deals with <i>korbanos</i>, also does not ignite much interest. But this is the
most profound moment in the history of Hashem's bond with <i>Klal Yisroel</i>.
After building the parts of the <i>Mishkan</i>, erecting the structure and
spending seven days offering sacrifices, on the eight day the Divine Presence
finally descends on the <i>Mishkan</i> to become a permanent presence in the
Jewish nation.</p>

<P>The structure of this sequence of events is not seen as an
"eight day" enterprise, rather it is a unit of seven days followed
by an "eighth day". It is as if there are two phases needed to bring
about the presence of the "Shechina".</p>

<P>Let us point to two parallels. First, in the classic primer
for <i>avodas</i> Hashem, the <i>Mesilas Yesharim</i>, the Ramchal describes
all the rungs in the ladder of <i>avodas</i> Hashem. At each step, he describes
in detail "the rung" itself, the ways in which one acquires it, and
how one stays away from pitfalls. When he comes to the last rung, i.e. <i>kedusha</i>,
there is a remarkable change. He starts by saying that <i>kedusha</i> is a
twofold entity; it starts with human endeavor, but ends with a Divine bestowal
of that <i>kedusha</i>.</p>

<P>Second, the Rambam, in a different frame, has a very similar
concept. In chapter seven of <i>Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah</i> he describes the
development of a <i>navi</i>. He discusses all of the character traits that he
must develop in himself, and if done properly, <i>Ruach Hakodesh</i> is
immediately bestowed upon him (<i>halacha</i> 1.) However, this is still not <i>nevuah</i>.
After further preparation he waits for the Divine Presence, which is <i>nevuah</i>,
which <u>may or may not happen</u> (<i>halacha</i> 5.)</p>

<P>In both the Ramchal and Rambam we find the same structure of
a person's <i>avodas</i> Hashem: many rungs that depend solely on
man's <i>avodah</i>, followed by the final step which is a display of
Hashem's participation [though there seems to be somewhat of a
disagreement whether <i>kedusha</i> or <i>nevuah</i> is that last rung.]</p>

<P>The reason for this two stage reality is that it is up to a
person to develop his own character and thus make himself worthy of bearing the
Divine Presence. But the "Divine Presence" is the
"other", and I cannot force it to come, no matter what I do.</p>

<P>This same dichotomy also is what distinguished the seven
days from the eight day. Seven days represent the human effort to be fully <i>mekadesh</i>
oneself, but that by itself is not the Divine Presence. The Divine Presence is
marked by the acceptance of the sacrifices by Hashem, expressed as the fire
coming down and consuming the sacrifices. This is analogous to when I present a
gift to a loved one - I can put all of my effort into making the gift as
beautiful and meaningful as possible, but it is up to the other person to
accept the gift and thus "complete the circuit".</p>

<P>Perhaps this was the reason that Aharon was so reluctant to
perform his duties, because of what he felt to be his character shortcomings
[i.e. the sin of the golden calf.] Had this <i>avodah</i> been presented as
just an obligation, he would not have resisted. After all, no one has the right
to demur at doing what he is supposed to do simply because he feels he is not a
big enough <i>tzaddik</i>! Rather, Aharon's protest was that if the goal
of that day's <i>avodah</i> was to have Hashem accept the sacrifices and
show how pleased He is with us, Aharon felt fearful that his shortcomings would
interfere.</p>

<P>Is this second phase of <i>kedusha</i> / <i>nevuah</i>
totally passive, or does it require something of us? Let us go back to the
analogy of a gift to a person whose closeness we desire. It is important that
gift be as nice as can be. But if I present it to the other person as a demand
or imposition, i.e. "look at how I'm treating you, you have no
choice but to be my friend", it is a turnoff for the other person. The
most important ingredient for the gift to be accepted is an air of humility and
an expression that it is my profoundest hope that you deem me fit to be close
to you. One cannot "bully" his way into Hashem's presence.</p>

<P>The Chozeh of Lublin [also quoted in the name of the
Ba'al Shem Tov] expressed this most succinctly in the words of Chazal,
"Moshe told [Aharon], 'why are you embarrassed [to bring the
sacrifice], for you have been chosen to do so [<i>lekach nivcharta</i>]'"
The Chozeh reads this as, "you have been chosen for this very reason [<i>lekach
nivcharta</i>]", i.e. your humility and lack of a sense of entitlement!</p>

<P>The totality of <i>avodas</i> Hashem thus requires of us
two, almost opposite, approaches. The first is an "<i>im ain ani li mi li</i>"
attitude, i.e. that everything stands on my, and only on my, efforts; combined
with an extraordinary humility of "<i>u'k'she'ani latzmi
mah ani</i>". Then, and only then, do we merit that the <i>Shechina</i>
"resides on our handiwork."</p>

<P>"Had Hashem brought us to Sinai and not given us the Torah, that would have been sufficient [to be grateful for.]" </p>

<P>This famous line from <i>Dayeinu</i> has been the focus of
endless <i>divrei Torah</i>. All of the previously mentioned items are worthy
gifts, i.e. freedom from Egypt, being fed in the desert, etc. But how do we
understand the "being at Sinai" having any value apart from the
giving of the Torah?</p>

<P>The simplest answer is that "Mount Sinai"
connotes the revelation of G-d to an extent that leaves no room for doubt. As
Rambam (<i>Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah</i> 8:1) famously points out, our faith does
not rest on any of the miracles that occurred in Egypt, no matter how grand,
for miracles can be explained away. The revelation of Sinai, however, was an
event during which all of <i>Klal Yisroel</i> directly experienced the Divine,
and as such is the only true cornerstone of our faith. We can thus reasonably
assume that the phrase, "had he brought us to Sinai" refers to
Divine revelation, which is the cornerstone of our faith regardless of the
Torah being given there and then as well.</p>

<P>This begs the question, then, why indeed are these two
events combined as one? Just like the events at Mitzrayim, especially the
splitting of the sea, are pillars of faith [i.e., "and they believed in
Hashem and Moshe His servant"- <i>Shemos</i> 14:31] and are not narrated
in conjunction with the giving of the Torah, so too why couldn't this
ultimate moment of revelation not have been independent of the giving of the
Torah? Would this not have better delineated each separate point - the belief
in Hashem and the giving of the Torah?</p>

<P>To address this point we must understand something about the
nature of the revelation. It is not a mere "proof of G-d", but
rather it reveals to us <b>how</b> we are to grasp Hashem.</p>

<P>All of the names of Hashem represent different facets of <i>Hakadosh
Baruch Hu</i>. Thus we are grasping Him as the source of kindness through those
names associate with kindness; the G-d of power through names associated with
that quality, and so on. But to have a correct grasp of Hashem, we must keep
our perspective focused on the most central aspect of His revelation, and
through it to view the entirety of His revelations.</p>

<P>Let us take an example of a skewed perspective. A rather
primitive person views G-d as primarily the "all-powerful" and as
having likes and dislikes which are communicated to us through Torah. Such a
person would conclude that one should adhere to Torah only due to the
expediency of falling in line with the "All Knowing and Powerful",
clearly an impoverished perspective. Even if one is somewhat more sophisticated
and understands G-d as also being the Source of existence, if that existence is
viewed primarily as being very physical and the <i>miztvos</i> are but a guide
to manage our world, the view in question is still a skewed one.</p>

<P><i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i> therefore revealed Himself with
His essence, i.e. the name of Havaya, at the moment of the giving of the Torah
(see Rashi, Vayikra 24:11, that the primary revelation of Havaya was at Sinai.)
Our perception of Hashem's central axis of revelation is the G-d of moral
good, the G-d of Torah; all else is ancillary to the implementation and
revelation thereof. Thus, the giving of Torah and the clearest revelation of
Hashem are one and the same. The miracles of Egypt reveal to us an all-powerful
G-d, and by implication the Creator. But only at Sinai is the "G-d
of <i>tov</i>" revealed to us.</p>

<P>This understanding of the Divine fundamentally
differentiates our <i>emunah</i> from all forms of <i>avodah zara</i>. Our
difference with them is not only, "<u>who</u> is G-d?" but, more
importantly, "<u>what</u> is G-d?" Their perception of divinity is
power and might, with "desirable actions" simply as a result of
that power.</p>

<P>Our G-d, <i>lehavdil</i>, is the G-d of <i>tov</i>, whose
Torah is the expression of that <i>tov</i> in our world. All other attributes
of G-d are simply branches and auxiliaries to this core essence.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[

<P>The excitement of reexamining! How many book are there in
the Torah? We know we call each volume a <i>Chumash</i>, meaning a fifth,
noting there are five books of the Torah. The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Shabbos</i> 116a)
teaches in the name of Rebi (R' Yehuda <i>HaNasi</i>) that in reality
there are seven books; the two <i>pesukim</i> of "<i>Vayehi Binsoa"</i>
and "U'v<i>enucho Yomar</i>" are surrounded by upside down letters
(<i>nuns</i>), and Rebi understands the significance of this demarcation to be
that these two verses consist of a book unto themselves. Thus the book of <i>Bamidbar</i>
is actually divided into three books: that which comes prior to these verses is
one book, these two verses are a second, and that which comes after are a
third. Together with the remaining four books, there are a total of seven. Indeed,
he brings support from <i>Mishlei</i> (9:1), "with all forms of wisdom did
she build her house, she carved out its seven pillars."</p>

<P>It is interesting to note that the Kli Yakar asks that if
this is correct, then a <i>sefer</i> of the Torah must contain a <i>mitzvah</i>,
and suggests that the <i>mitzvah</i> contained herein is that of <i>peru u'revu</i>,
procreation. This <i>mitzvah</i> is so important that it warrants a book unto
itself as it enables the continuation of the world. Moreover, he notes that the
second verse concludes inviting the <i>Shechina</i> to reside amongst the "<i>rivevos
alphei yisroel</i>" which comes to 22,000, the minimal number necessary
to host the <i>Shechina</i>.</p>

<P>Rabban Shimon <i>ben</i> Gamliel (<i>ibid</i>) has a
different explanation for the encasing of these verses by inverted "<i>nuns</i>",
namely to teach that this is not the proper place for these verses. Rather,
they belong fifty paragraphs earlier in <i>Parshas Bamidbar</i> (2:17) following
the Torah's description of the formation of the order and tRaveling
of the Jewish nation. First, we are taught about the camp of Judah, followed by
that of Reuven, followed by the <i>Mishkan</i>. That is the appropriate place
for these two verses as the Torah would be highlighting the primary component
of the <i>Mishkan</i>, namely the Aron. The reason why it is placed here,
explains Rabban Gamliel, is to create a buffer between three sins enumerated in
succession. Had the three sins been presented in a consecutive order, it would
have constituted a <i>chazakah</i> of <i>poranos </i>- misfortune. Therefore, to
spare the Jewish nation any negative consequence, Hashem, in His kindness,
places these two verses here. Indeed, when the <i>moshiach</i> comes, please
God, speedily in our days nothing will change in the Torah except the future <i>sefer</i>
Torah will be written with these verses in their ideal place - in the beginning
of <i>Bamidbar</i>.</p>

<P>In identifying the first of the three sins, the Ramban points
to the <i>passuk</i> (10:33) "<i>Vayisu mehar Hashem</i>." At first
glance this is not a sin; one could even argue this is something virtuous since
they followed His instructions. They waited until the <i>anan</i> (the cloud of
glory) ascended from Mount Sinai and began marching toward the Land of Israel,
where it is a <i>mitzvah</i> to come. On the surface, this is only
praiseworthy. However, the Ramban notes that they left <i>b'simcha</i>,
with gladness, with almost a sense of relief "as a child runs from
school." Instead of sighing and expressing some nostalgic disappointment
as to having to move and proceed to the next <i>mitzvah</i>, they left <i>Har</i>
Sinai relieved as they were not getting any more <i>mitzvos</i>. This improper
mindset is reckoned as a sin for our ancestors.</p>

<P>We have been locked out of our <i>batei kenesiyos</i> due to
a pandemic. When we are readying to gradually return, it behooves us to learn from
the past and return with the right mindset. As they were judged for their
inappropriate exodus, I pray that we will be welcomed On High with our
appropriate re-entry.</p>

<P>The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Megillah</i> 29a) understands the
verse in Yechezkel (11:16), "<i>Va'ehi lachem l'mikdash m'eat</i> -
yet I have been for them a minor sanctuary" to mean that our synagogues
and study halls are endowed with sanctity. Both the Rambam (<i>Mitzvas Lo Sa'asei</i>
65) and the Yerei'im understand that the biblical <i>mitzvah</i> of "<i>mikdeshi
tira'u</i>" (<i>Vayikra</i> 25:2) is applicable to our synagogues
and study halls. The mindset must be that just as if two individuals have
business to discuss and they meet twenty minutes before <i>mincha</i> to
discuss the matter it goes without saying that they are not allowed to talk
"shop-talk" in the <i>Beis Haknesess</i>, even when no <i>minyan</i>
is going on, all the more so when <i>tefillah</i> <u>is</u> going on it is
prohibited to talk during shul!</p>

<P>In addition, the Ramban in his commentary (<i>Vayikra</i> 26:1-2)
on the last two verses of <i>Parshas Behar</i> teaches that these two verses
are a continuation of the above paragraph, where the Torah is speaking of a Jew
who is tragically sold to a non-Jew. To that person, the Torah warns against
idolatry, to observe the Shabbos, and to revere His sanctuary. The Ramban cites
the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> (9:6) that the servant should not say "since my
master is an idolater, I will be too; since my master is immoral and does not
keep Shabbos, so too will I." The Ramban concludes by saying that these
three <i>mitzvos</i> are <i>avos</i>-primary to connect the servant to his
tradition and people.</p>

<P>The fact that the Ramban labels these three <i>mitzvos</i>
as <i>avos</i> highlights for us the importance of the synagogue and study
hall. When one abstains from idolatry they don't immediately feel His presence.
So too, although by honoring and keeping the Shabbos not everyone is able to
feel the <i>Shechina</i>, however upon entering the <i>Beis Hamkidash</i> it
was palpable; you knew you were in His presence. The Torah commands (<i>Shemos</i>
23:17) "<i>Year'eh kol zechurcha</i>", everyone felt the
closeness and presence of Hashem. The constant remembrance of the <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i> to which we have been praying and pining for throughout our
history is to endow within us the great reverence we feel for the <i>Mikdash</i>,
and that reverence is to be palpable by our respect for the minor sanctuaries.</p>

<P>The Gemara (<i>Berachos</i> 8a) teaches in the name of Rav
Chisda that, "a person should always enter through two doors in the
synagogue." This is based on the <i>passuk</i> in Mishlei (8;34),
"praiseworthy is the person who listens to Me, to hasten to my doors
everyday." The use of the plural "doors" is the source for this
teaching. The Yerushalmi (<i>Berachos</i> 5;1) sates explicitly that when one
comes to pray in the synagogue they are to enter through two doors. The Bach (Shulchan,
Orach Chaim 90:5) cites the opinion of Tosafos that one is not to begin
davening immediately upon entering, but is to wait at least the distance it
takes to walk through two doors.</p>

<P>The Sfas Emes says in the name of Rav Simcha Bunim of <i>Peshischa</i>
that before praying one must pass through two doors, the door out of the
earthly realm and the door into the heavenly realm, and only then should one
pray. The ability to close the first doors, to completely shut off the phone
(not on vibrate) and leave matters of the workplace behind is the first step in
reentering the <i>Beis Hakeneses</i>. Failure to do so is in flagrant
violation, if not literal then certainly the spirit of, <i>Mikdeshai Tira'u
-</i> My sanctuary you shall revere, as understood in <i>Yevamos</i> (6b) that
one may not enter the Temple Mount with his money belt. Just as the money belt
is clearly demonstrative of his worldly affairs, so too is ones cell phone.</p>

<P>In addition, many have shared with me that these weeks of
davening at home have been advantageous in that they have had the ability to
daven more slowly, have greater understanding of the <i>tefillos</i>, and
appreciate that davening is a privilege to have a personal encounter with
Hashem. As busy as He is running the world with all its complexities, He has
time for each and every one; He cares for each and every one; He is personally
involved in our lives. If we can begin now to focus on the eventual return in
accordance with the medical and <i>Halachik</i> guidance that has been
cautiously and meticulously steering us during these most challenging times,
then, in contrast to our ancestors of old who did not leave <i><u>Har</u></i>
Sinai in appropriate way, we will return most reverently, respectfully, and with
great appreciation for our <i>Mikdash M'eat</i>.</p>

<P>"If only we had open miracles, if only we can see the
hand of G-d." Too many individuals think that clearly supernatural
phenomena and experiences would change their perspective on life and would
bolster their religious observance. They would be set for life, having
personally experienced and witnessed the supernatural.</p>

<P><i>Parshas Beshalach</i> and the incredible miracle of <i>kriyat
Yam Suf</i>, however, proves them wrong. We are taught that immediately after Bnei
Yisrael sang (<i>Shemos</i> 15:18), "Hashem shall reign for all
eternity" they tRaveled for three days in the desert but did not find
water. They arrived at Marah but could not drink the waters of Marah as they
were bitter. If we were writing the story, we would have thought that as
challenging as the crisis seemed, they would have stayed as calm as possible,
having personally experienced His benevolence. The same Hashem that provided
water in Egypt when their masters only had blood, that spared them from all the
other plagues, and three days earlier had performed the miraculous salvation on
their behalf, would somehow rescue them from this situation as well. After all,
we are taught that after seeing their former masters washed ashore in front of
them, thereby alleviating their fears that the Egyptians had emerged from the
waters just as they had, the Torah proclaims (<i>Shemos</i> 13:31), "They
had faith in Hashem and in Moshe, His servant."</p>

<P>Sadly, and unfortunately, a different reality presents
itself. Rashi (15:25) teaches in the name of the Mechilta that instead of
coming to Moshe and asking him to pray for water, they complained. What
happened to their <i>emunah</i>? What is especially noteworthy, is the
understanding of our Ravs in the Talmud (<i>Bava Kama</i> 82a) that when the
Torah records that they went three days without water, in addition to being
understood literally the text is also to be understood to refer to Torah, that
water is a metaphor for Torah and their disconnect from Torah for three days weakened
and diminished the charge of <i>emunah</i> they had recently acquired. The
Talmud records that either the prophets that immediately succeeded Moshe, or,
as the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 12:1) teaches, Moshe himself, instituted
that the Torah be read/taught on Shabbos, Monday, and Thursday so that the
Jewish people will not go three days without Torah. The Tikunei Zohar (<i>Shemos</i>
60a) teaches that Hashem, His Torah, and Israel are one and inseparable. Torah
is the great connector. When the Jewish people are connected to Hashem through
the Torah, then their <i>emunah</i> can uplift and sustain them. When, however,
they are disconnected from Torah, miracles by themselves do not have a long-term
effect.</p>

<P>Case in point; in Kings (I, chapter 19) we read of the
miraculous descent of fire orchestrated by Eliyahu <i>haNavi</i> on Mount
Carmel. We are taught that the many spectators who previously could not decide
where their allegiance lay, either to Hashem or to Ba'al, responded to
the fire by immediately bursting forth with, "Hashem, He is the G-d, Hashem
He is the G-d", and they then slaughtering the four hundred and fifty
false prophets of Ba'al. Sadly, they soon returned to their former ways.
The exalting effect of miracles dissipates very quickly. The reason this is so is
to restore man to his state of freedom of choice, free will.</p>

<P>The immediate proximity of the story of Marah and its bitter
waters, placed between the splitting of the sea and their tRaveling to receive
the Torah at Sinai, seems a bit out of place. Why record this incident altogether?
I believe the Torah is teaching that to bolster and sustain the impact of miracles
one needs the study of Torah. The study of Torah attaches the individual to
G-d, which is in effect perpetuating the miraculous.</p>

<P>Miracles were most necessary. The Ramban explains regarding
the first of the ten commandments, that Bnei Yisroel accepted Hashem as their
G-d because they personally experienced through the miraculous events in Egypt
that He is the Creator and Legislator. However, the effect of miracles dissipates
very quickly.</p>

<P>In addition to literally imbibing godliness, the study of
Torah maintains and sustains our <i>emunah</i>. We see how the prophecies of
the Torah have come true, and it reinforces our belief that all the future
prophecies will be fulfilled.</p>

<P>The Ohr Hachaim, at the beginning of <i>Parshas Tetzaveh</i>,
cites the Zohar that we were redeemed from the three prior exiles of the Jewish
people in the merit of the three Patriarchs. We will be redeemed from the
fourth exile in the merit of Moshe, and this exile is so long because Moshe
does not wish to redeem a people who are not involved in Torah study. We pray
that the recent <i>Siyum Hashas</i> not only united so many Jews worldwide,
rallying them around the accomplishment of completing <i>Shas</i>, but
hopefully has also aroused many more to dedicate time and effort to the study
of Torah, thereby enhancing their life and hastening the redemption.</p>

<P>Finally, in keeping with Tu B'shvat, this forthcoming
Monday, the double miracle at Marah was that the bitter tree sweetened the
bitter waters. The Mechilta teaches that the verb "<i>vayorehu</i>"
- that Hashem showed Moshe a tree - was chosen instead of "<i>vayarehu</i>"
because the former has the additional connotation of teaching and instruction.
Hashem showed Moshe teachings of Torah that are compared to the tree that
nourishes, and the teachings of Torah sweetened both the waters and the people
who had become embittered. Tu B'shvat is not only a day to partake in the
fruits of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and thank Hashem for the bounty of our blessed
land, but it is also to appreciate the sanctity of the land which comes from
its being the ideal place for the observance of Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>.</p>
